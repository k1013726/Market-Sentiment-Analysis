0,"Last week, there was a small uproar in the Web 3 world when a new protocol, DeSo, announced an update to its user login flow. Previously, the decentralized media service had asked users to enter their “seed phrase” into the project’s web interface, defying all generally accepted best security practices and drawing criticism across the industry.“Chrome extensions like MetaMask are more secure, but most mainstream users will never install them. Instead of yelling at our users about security best practices, we did something radical: We met them where they are today,” explained DeSo’s founder, Nader Al-Naji. The team found, however, that they had not actually met users where they were given that “10% of people lost their seed immediately.”Jill Gunter, a CoinDesk columnist, is a venture partner with Slow Ventures, where she invests in early-stage crypto and Web3 projects. She is also a co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system.To address this issue, DeSo now offers users the ability to automatically back up their seed phrases to Google Drive from within the application. If anything, this is even worse from a security perspective than their original login flow.When it comes to seed phrases, the generally accepted best practice is never to store them on any device that is connected to (or has been connected to) the internet. These 12-, 18- or 24-word phrases are what enable users to recover the assets stored in a given digital wallet should they lose or replace the device they used to access their funds. Seed phrases are so sensitive because they allow anybody who knows their magic words to gain access to the associated assets.Read More: DeSo Wants Your Seed Phrase. Let Them Come and Take ItMost crypto and Web 3 applications encourage users to write down their seed phrases and store them somewhere secure, such as a bunker or a physical safe deposit box. Do not tell anyone. Do not store the phrase in an online password manager, the wisdom goes, let alone in your Google Drive. And do not ever enter your seed phrase into a website form, lest you become the victim of a phishing attack.And yet, my experience of interacting with all kinds of crypto and Web 3 users suggests that few take this wisdom on board. It is easy to empathize with DeSo’s predicament.I have fielded many messages from friends who only lightly dabble in crypto asking me for help in remembering “what 12-word sentence” they might have used to back up the bitcoin wallet they set up in 2017. (As a note: unlike a password, users do not decide what their seed phrase should be; it is instead generated for them. Which is yet another point of friction and confusion for users to overcome.)I have seen seed phrases scribbled in notebooks left in backpacks under the counters at bars during crypto conferences. I have acted as customer support on crypto projects and had users message me with their private keys (despite my admonitions not to) asking for help. I have seen users post their private keys in Discord channels. I, myself, only a couple of weeks ago came across 24 words scribbled down on a Post-It note in the bottom of a purse I frequently used a few years ago. I doubt that I will ever know what wallet it is associated with.In light of these observations and experiences, it is tempting to shrug and say that maybe DeSo has it right. For the average user just dabbling in Web 3 for the first time, maybe it is the most sensible approach to store seed phrases somewhere like Google Drive. Better there than in a sock drawer, right?Problem is, even if today the stakes for the average user would be low in keeping their keys in Google Drive, down the line the consequences may become financially significant. It seems that every year, the media becomes fixated on some other poor sap who bought bitcoin in 2011, made hundreds of millions of dollars, but lost their seed phrase and can no longer access the funds (the guy who lost half a billion in a dump in Wales comes to mind).While DeSo users who store their seed phrases in Google Drive will not have to worry about losing track of the seed phrase, they will have to worry about their Google account becoming a target for hackers. If lots of early adopters of the protocol do become millionaires off of the assets they have stored within the DeSo system, then suddenly Google Drive will become an enormous honeypot for all of them. This is dangerous for users – and presumably a situation that DeSo would like to avoid.For the industry, there is an even bigger problem with DeSo’s approach. It is teaching users to do things that are dangerous without adequately explaining to them what the risks are. DeSo is neither educating users nor mitigating the risks they are asking users to take on. DeSo is merely cutting corners and creating problematic habits that users will take with them when they go to use other Web 3 applications.The user experience of accessing and engaging with crypto remains an unsolved problem. Web 3 and crypto almost definitionally ask users to take on more responsibility when engaging with the internet. The responsibilities and challenges arise well beyond the problem of seed phrase storage. Many hardcore crypto proponents advocate for users to run their own nodes for the protocols they interact with. Users regularly have to navigate block explorers to view transaction details, wrap and unwrap assets into different token standards, and, of course, deal with expensive, opaque and unpredictable fees.Much of crypto reverses what Web 2 has trained users to expect and feel comfortable with. With the trusted, free, seamless applications of Web 2, users can port across devices that open and unfold with a mere glance or a buzz on a wristwatch, often without so much as entering a password. That stands in stark contrast to Web 3 and its device-siloed, security-intensive experience that asks users to navigate inscrutable flows, often with little education or instruction embedded in the product.And therein lies a key part of the user experience solution: education. We should not think so little of users that we have to cut corners for them, as DeSo does. After all, a core principle of crypto lies in the empowerment of the individual. Teach users about their options and the associated risks (including, indeed, the options of storing a seed phrase in Google Drive), and let them choose.When I think about the user experience of Web 3 today, I am often brought back to my earliest experiences using a computer and the internet. I recall, as a 5- or 6-year-old, looking on as my uncle set up a Gateway computer for my parents in our family room and hooked us up, for the first time, to dial-up internet. He was using all kinds of jargon that would become native to us all over the next 10 years, but to my parents was clearly foreign and uncomfortable.The “operating system,” the “modem,” the “IP address.” I can still remember the aura of skepticism and exhaustion my parents seemed to share once my uncle had left that afternoon. As if they were thinking: “There’s no way we are ever going to figure out how to use this.”Read more: DeSo Launches $50M Fund for Decentralized Social EcosystemBut we all figured it out! The average computer user may not be able to give you the precise, technically accurate explanation of the role an operating system plays on their computer, or why a modem is needed or how an IP address is derived. But billions of us have figured out how to upgrade an operating system, plug in a modem and connect to Wi-Fi networks. Some of this has come down to innovation in user experience, but much of it has simply resulted from user education combined, importantly, with strong incentives for users to get up to speed. Once I caught a glimpse of what that old desktop computer connected to the internet could offer me, I made it my business to understand what I needed to be able to use it. Neopets and America Online were enough to motivate me to figure it out in all of its complexity.The same is, and will continue to be, true of crypto and Web 3. With a strong enough value proposition, concerns about users balking and churning at the prospect of downloading a Chrome plugin or having to securely store a 12-word phrase will diminish for product builders. That is not to say that we should not still work to improve these experiences. It is only to say that we should not assume that we have to go to the extreme measures of cutting corners to onboard users. We ought to give them more credit than that. And if cutting corners is what it takes to users to pick up your product, then perhaps you should re-examine whether your product is actually providing sufficient value.",2022/01/19
1,"Crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments wants to become the sponsor and manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the company said in a blog post this week.Valkyrie, one of Grayscale’s rivals, previously launched a bitcoin trust and a bitcoin-related exchange-traded-fund (ETF) in 2021. As part of their plan to sponsor GBTC, the world’s largest bitcoin fund, the Tennessee-based company also announced the launch of a new fund, the Valkyrie Opportunistic Fund, LP that seeks to take advantage of GBTC’s discount to the value of its underlying bitcoin, the company said.Valkyrie’s plan would be a tall order, considering that GBTC alone has over $10 billion in assets and Valkyrie only handles roughly $180 million in total assets.“We understand that Grayscale has played an important role in the development and growth of the bitcoin ecosystem with the launch of GBTC, and we respect the team and the work that they have done,” Valkyrie said. “However, in light of recent events involving Grayscale and its family of affiliated companies, it is time for a change.”Grayscale and CoinDesk are both owned by the Digital Currency Group.In its proposal, Valkyrie said it wants to facilitate GBTC redemptions at net asset value (NAV) for investors through a Regulation M filing. It also proposes to lower the fees to 75 basis points as opposed to the current 200 basis points, and to offer redemptions in both bitcoin and cash.Earlier this month, GBTC shares hit a record-high discount rate of over 50% relative to the price of bitcoin (BTC). GBTC’s recent struggles were triggered by the Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) reiteration of its reasons for denying Grayscale Investment’s application to convert GBTC into a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale called the initial denial “arbitrary, capricious and discriminatory.”Grayscale did not immediately return a request for comment.",2022/12/30
2,"The mining industry started 2022 off strong with what seemed like ample capital to expand, but high energy prices, increasing competition for Bitcoin blocks and a bear market hit miners, knocking out those with high leverage.The sector was shaken by bankruptcies and loan defaults, and next year will likely bring even more pain, as miners struggle to bolster their balance sheets and operations. But it will also present an opportunity for those in a position to buy assets, as well as for those that can improve their margins with new innovations.CoinDesk spoke to some of the top executives and analysts in bitcoin mining to review past year and predict trends for 2023. Here’s what they said.Industry participants say that lots of money was spent over the last year to boost hashrate, a measure of computing power on the Bitcoin network, but that in many cases, those investments didn’t pay off, as companies loaded up on debt to finance the growth only to see the economics of crypto mining break down.""Many miners acted too deterministically,"" projecting bitcoin (BTC) would hit $100,000 and not even considering that the price would drop below $20,000, said Juri Bulovic, head of mining at crypto mining and staking firm Foundry, which is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group.With falling bitcoin prices, many companies had trouble meeting their debt obligations.Read more: Bitcoin Miners’ FTX Contagion Exposure May Amplify Industry Pain""There aren’t many ways to financially materialize those plans. One either sells bitcoin, borrows debts or issues equity. When selling mined bitcoin was barely enough to cover OpEx (operating expenses), many opted for debt financing as the equity market turned cold,"" said Wolfie Zhao, head of research at TheMinerMag, the data and research arm of mining consultancy BlocksBridge.Read more: Crypto Miners Face Margin Calls, Defaults as Debt Comes Due in Bear MarketOn the flip slide, lenders were too optimistic.""Many had not been able to properly assess the risks associated with such mining rigs-backed loans given that this is the first cycle in which such loans were given out,"" Bulovic noted.Some miners saw their debt-to-equity ratio, a measure that shows a company’s financial leverage, more than triple in the third quarter, according to TheMinerMag data.Unsurprisingly, miners that had high debt-to-equity ratios, like Core Scientific (CORZ), Greenidge Generation (GREE) and Stronghold Digital Mining have had to either file for bankruptcy or restructure their debt obligations.Many miners also failed to hedge their risks against a falling bitcoin price.“Bitcoin miners have much to learn from traditional commodity-producing industries like oil and gas. Instead of using financial instruments to increase their long oil exposure, oil producers hedge their exposure by selling oil futures. Hopefully, this bear market will inspire miners to decrease their bitcoin price risk through more sophisticated risk management,” Jaran Mellerud, an analyst at Luxor Technologies, a provider of bitcoin-mining services, said. Luxor opened a derivatives desk to sell hedging products to miners in October, although the idea of hedging with derivatives had already started to sow its seeds within the miners as the broader market crumbled.""I really think investors want two things – they want transparency and they want predictability – and that's what hedging brings to a miner,"" said Chris Bae, founder and CEO of digital-asset trading firm Enhanced Digital Group. Bae’s firm provides hedging products to miners that are trying to implement risk-management strategies. Other companies such as crypto-focused financial-services firm Galaxy Digital and Singapore-based digital-asset management platform Metalpha are also providing hedging services to miners.TheMinerMag’s Zhao pointed out that it wasn’t only overleverage that has brought some miners to their knees, but also lack of treasury management.""If Core had been selling half of its mined bitcoin every month and holding the rest since January 2021, it likely won't be so troubled as it is now while still having a few K [thousands] of BTC on its balance sheet to capture the long-term upside,"" he said, referring to Core Scientific, a miner that filed for bankruptcy in December.Instead, the world’s largest miner by hashrate waited ""until May when the market pain started to really kick in"" to start selling its accumulated digital assets, Zhao said.Miners that had a high proportion of debt relative to their bitcoin production have found themselves under water.“Five of the six companies with the largest net debts per BTC mined have had some level of restructure since the second half of this year, with the exception of Marathon Digital Holdings,” Zhao said.The analyst thinks that Marathon has bucked the trend in part because the mining firm raised $750 million last year in unsecured convertible notes with a 1% coupon rate. Core Scientific, by contrast, raised $500 million in secured convertible notes with a 10% rate.Marathon is also working to reduce its debt obligations, the firm told CoinDesk.Still, Jaime Leverton, CEO of Canadian miner Hut 8 (HUT), predicts the worst is yet to come in terms of capitulation and bankruptcies, particularly in the first half of 2023, and she’s not sure that relief will come in the second half.Luxor’s Vera said he expects many companies to be taken private, saying companies can gain efficiencies by hosting and running machines.But Fiorenzo Manganiello, founder of Cowa, a mining and venture-funding firm, said buyers may be better off just purchasing bitcoin rather than dealing with hassles of owning and operating machines.For the rest of the pack, the year looks like a year of survival and recovery.“Unless we see a full-scale bull market, which I doubt we will, miners will use 2023 to strengthen their balance sheets and improve their operating efficiencies. The year’s biggest trends will be cost minimization and debt reduction,” Mellerud said.Read more: Bitcoin Miners’ FTX Contagion Exposure May Amplify Industry PainIn 2023, miners will not only have to find the best energy deals, but get creative about how they can lower their costs or bring in revenue by tweaking their power consumption and supply, industry experts say.As margins continue to compress, miners will have to look at how they can participate in “demand response programs,” meaning selling power back to the grid in times of high demand, as well as recapturing heat from mining rigs and using stranded energy, Bulovic said. “Miners who have a real grasp on the processes, policies, regulations and technical know-how of these adjacent industries will gain an edge over the other miners,” he said.Read more: Bitcoin Miners Powered Off as Winter Storm Battered North AmericaCrypto mining is becoming a bigger part of the energy industry, and by the end of 2023, more companies will need to be vertically integrated, with their own power source in order “to maintain long-term stable operation, as the halving is just getting closer,” according to Daniel Jogg, CEO of Enerhash, a Hungary-based company that runs blockchain data centers. Halving is when the number of bitcoin mined per block drops by 50%.Another lesson related to the importance of managing power costs is on hosting, the business model in which firms bring in revenue for owning and operating the infrastructure. “High energy prices and low bitcoin prices have been particularly hard on this model,” Zach Bradford, CEO of crypto miner CleanSpark (CLSK) said.Compute North, the first big firm in the industry to go bankrupt, was primarily a hosting firm. Core Scientific was also losing money in its hosting business – about $10 million in the third quarter.Read more: ​​Core Scientific Again Raises Bitcoin Mining Hosting RatesMining firms like Digihost Technology (DGHI), Greenidge Generation and Argo Blockchain (ARBK) that relied on natural gas or the electricity grid for their power, saw their costs skyrocket in the third quarter, according to the data from TheMinerMag.The trend of cost per bitcoin produced over the year “looks very similar to the U.S average household energy price increase this year. The average of all the major mining companies' cost of production per BTC mined has gone up by 7% in Q3 compared to Q1,” Zhao said.As miners try to become more efficient and bring down power costs, they might end up taking a counterintuitive path – underclocking mining machines. That’s the practice of “reducing energy consumption and total hashrate to improve energy efficiency,” which is “one of the best and most readily available technologies” to improve efficiencies and control costs, Ben Gagnon, chief mining officer at Canadian miner Bitfarms (BITF), said.Nascent technologies like immersion and hydro cooling are also becoming more popular, but it is uncertain whether miners will deploy them at scale in the future because of cost concerns.Immersion cooling entails submerging mining machines in a tank of fluid, whereas hydro cooling entails a new generation of mining rig, which are heavily promoted by Bitmain, the world’s largest mining machine equipment manufacturer. Hydro machines have tubes placed close to the chips. Fluids go through these tubes, taking heat out of the machine. These rigs require a special infrastructure to run, and often to treat the water such that it doesn’t degrade the tubes over time.Read more: Amid Market Rout, Crypto Miners Are Still Building“Even though the current mining economics has disincentivized miners from experimenting with these new technologies, we do expect to still see progress being made in 2023 to advance the technology and lower costs,” Foundry’s Bulovic said.Aydin Kilic, president and chief operating officer at Canadian crypto miner Hive Blockchain (HIVE), touted the Hive Buzzminers, a new mining rig built using Intel’s (INTC) highly anticipated Blocksale chip. These mining machines will be the first ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miner deployed by any of the major public crypto mining companies and designed in-house, he said.The past year started with a noticeable centralization of the bitcoin mining hashrate in the U.S. In January, the U.S. accounted for about 38% of computing power on the Bitcoin blockchain, and Canada almost 7%, according to the Centre for Alternative Finance at the University of Cambridge. Next year, that trend might be broken. Luxor’s Mellerud and Chief Operating Officer Ethan Vera both expect miners to migrate to South America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia because those regions have cheaper electricity.Hut 8’s Leverton said that this decentralization is her “hope,” given that bitcoin is supposed to be a distributed network, not aggregated in one particular jurisdiction, although she noted that political instability could be an obstacle in some countries.Read more: Bitcoin Miners’ High Hopes for Latin America Dented by Paraguay Many places are concerned about bitcoin mining’s energy use and its impact on local communities, and in 2022, they started setting limits.In the past year, New York state enacted a two-year moratorium on new bitcoin mining operations, lawmakers in the U.S. are targeting the industry’s energy use, utilities in three Canadian provinces have stopped approving new bitcoin mining connections to the grid, and a bill is under consideration in Kazakhstan that will cap the energy available to miners.Industry experts said they don’t expect any regulation on the federal level in the U.S. or Canada in the coming year, but local or state governments might continue to place restrictions on the industry.Gagnon of Bitfarms sees this small-scale regulation as an important testing ground for any federal laws to come in the years ahead.Vera, however, cautioned that the moratorium set by New York state “sets a challenging precedent” for the rest of the U.S. for expansion of new mining farms. New site developments across states controlled by Democrats are likely to be targeted by regulation, he said.Mellerud said that in Europe, the European Union regulators will be “more aggressive toward bitcoin miners in 2023.”As the continent “struggles with its energy crisis, energy-intensive industries like bitcoin miners become natural scapegoats that regulators could target to score some cheap political point,” he said.Read more: Europe’s Last Bitcoin Mining Refuge Is No Longer Viable",2022/12/30
3,"Investment giant BlackRock (BLK) has committed $17 million to bankrupt bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ) as part of a new $75 million loan from the miner's secured convertible note holders, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that was filed on Thursday.BlackRock, which is Core Scientific's largest shareholder according to FactSet data, already held $37.9 million in secured convertible notes as of Wednesday. The latest $17 million is part of the new $75 million convertibles notes, which are part of Core's prearranged bankruptcy process, the filing says. In a prearranged bankruptcy, the debtor reaches some sort of agreement with its creditors before officially filing for bankruptcy.Core Scientific, the largest miner by computing power, filed for Chapter 11 on Dec. 21. The move comes as miners in general have been squeezed by high energy costs and low bitcoin (BTC) prices. Core noted that it expects support from some of its convertible noteholders in the form of two debtor-in-possession (DIP) facilities, totaling up to $75 million.According to the restructuring plan, the secured debt convertible noteholders will get equity. The current equity and unsecured holders will get warrants so that as the company grows, they will get more shares, its chief mining officer, Russell Cann, told CoinDesk.Read more: Inside Core Scientific’s Prearranged BankruptcyOut of the total $75 million, the lenders have already committed $57 million, including BlackRock's new loan, to the miner. The DIP facility has a maturity date of June 21, 2023 with terms to extend to Sept. 21, according to the new filing.Shares of Core Scientific traded at 8 cents on Friday afternoon.Core first warned of the risk of bankruptcy in late October and said it wouldn't be paying some of its loan installments, sending its shares plummeting about 80% on Nasdaq. In November, it reiterated that it may run out of money by the end of this year. Compute North, another major firm in the mining business, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September. Crypto miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK) narrowly avoided bankruptcy after getting a $100 million bailout from Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital this week.BlackRock, Vanguard and Fidelity are among few of the TradFi giants that invested in bitcoin miners during the bull run as shares of publicly traded miners offered a faster way to get exposure to the sector, without having to buy bitcoin directly in the face of uncertain regulations.Read more: Crypto Miners Face Margin Calls, Defaults as Debt Comes Due in Bear Market",2022/12/30
4,"For many people, myself included, who were drawn to cryptocurrencies by the prospect of fixing or replacing an exclusionary, extractive, outdated global financial system, the failure in crypto markets this past year has delivered an extremely cold bath.Now, to be clear, most of the massive financial hit to investors was not due to a failure of technology.For the Bitcoin blockchain, for example, none of the drama of the past year matters. Every 10 minutes, day in, day out, it adds a block of transactions to its ever-growing ledger. It’s a reminder that the global, decentralized networks of computers running Bitcoin, Ethereum and other permissionless blockchain’s protocols continue to forge systems for intermediary-free value exchange with which no one person or entity can interfere, regardless of the ups and downs of markets. The presence and persistence of these vast autonomous machines continue to leave me awestruck.You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.But “crypto” is more than protocols, smart contracts and cryptography. It’s also the community of humans who have gathered around this amalgam of technologies. Without this community, the technology can’t enter real-world adoption and foster change for good. And unfortunately, the failures in 2022 were due to their actions. While a few people in particular are rightly lumped with the bulk of the blame, there is mass collective responsibility here. The theft, deception and staggering breach of trust happened on our watch.If we are to take lessons from the wealth destruction of 2022, the conclusion cannot be that this is all the fault of Sam Bankman-Fried and his ilk. SBF deserves the prison time he seems sure to receive with his extradition to the U.S., but the real question is how do we create a system – not merely a technological system but one of laws and standards – that makes it much harder for people like him to do what they did.There is much work to do to build that system in 2023 and beyond. But it starts with the lessons of 2022. There are many. Here are the five that I think are the most important:With all the headlines generated by the collapse of FTX in November, it’s easy to forget that far bigger losses hit cryptocurrency markets in the first months of the year – not because of a crypto-endemic scandal but because the Federal Reserve was hiking interest rates. That put an end to the surfeit of dollars pouring into speculative assets around the world, including cryptocurrencies. The macro environment matters.The domino effect, seen when the failure of one crypto institution quickly spreads to another, is hardly without precedent. It was there in the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 1998 Long-Term Capital Management collapse, the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis and many other such moments in financial history. They all had the same characteristics: an overly bullish belief in the upward momentum of financial assets fueled an excessive buildup of loans to speculators. When those beliefs proved unfounded, the rush to the exits exposed an interdependent network of creditors and debtors as they dragged each other down in unison. Crypto speculation was never going to be immune from this, regardless of the decentralized nature of the underlying protocols.Most of the high-profile collapses in 2022 – FTX, Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital, Genesis – involved custody-holding CeFi (centralized finance) companies that put customer funds at risk. That has galvanized supporters of DeFi (decentralized finance), who rightly note that the most robust decentralized market-making and exchange systems survived, precisely because they lack a trusted intermediary capable of such abuse. (Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also CoinDesk's parent company.)Yet as of October, Chainalysis estimated that DeFi investors had lost a record $3 billion year to date because of smart contract breaches, “rug pulls” by founders, and because the underlying tokenomics of some protocols were deeply flawed. (The destructive collapse in the Terra ecosystem was exemplary of the latter instance.) DeFi is a wild, volatile, confusing, unpredictable place. To achieve widespread participation, it needs a more comprehensive audit model in which trustworthy independent analysts or bounty-hunting developers assess projects’ code security, founder practices and tokenomics.In 2020 and 2021, when social media-driven meme coins were turning kids into instant millionaires, when DeFi projects were paying yields unavailable anywhere else in the world and when institutional and retail investment sent crypto’s market capitalization up 15-fold to almost reach $3 trillion, we should all have been asking tougher questions. The most important one should have been: what’s underpinning all this?If we peel back the layers of interlocking protocols and the justifications for the returns they were promising, we’re left with little more than speculation for speculation’s sake. Most of that was built on momentum trading, on “numbers-go-up” expectations. It’s time to get back to basics and seek out real-world utility. Token returns need to point back to actual value cases, whether its cross-border payments, decentralized energy, new marketing models offered by non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or one of many other promising use cases.Sure, this one’s self-interested, but 2022 proved it to be undeniably true that this industry needs a robust “Fourth Estate” to hold accountable the people and entities working within it. Permissionless blockchains should be viewed as public goods – much as the air we breathe, the water we drink or the highways we drive on are public goods. They must be protected as such, which means there must be transparency (balanced with a respect for individual privacy). And while we are all enormously proud of the catalytic role CoinDesk played in exposing the FTX house of cards, it raises the question of why this wasn’t caught earlier. Answer: There aren’t enough crypto-savvy, professionally managed, independence-protected journalists covering this market. (That’s why we got those naive softball articles from the New York Times and others that glossed over SBF’s fraudulent behavior and got my colleague David Morris fired up.)Still, here’s a hill I will die on: The requisite transparency isn't something that can be achieved solely through the work of “citizen journalists” on Twitter or elsewhere. Those who claim the FTX debacle was brought to the fore by crowd-sourcing the sleuthing work of ordinary people on social media ignore the fact that the meltdown was triggered by an investigative article by Ian Allison, a trained journalist working within the structure of a professionally run newsroom, with editors and management who have carved out a position of independence from their proprietor to earn the trust of their readers. (CoinDesk is a subsidiary of DCG but operates independently and abides by a core code of ethics.) Before Ian’s piece, where was all that Twitter wisdom-of-the-crowd discovery?If this industry is to thrive it can’t again be blindsided by revelations of wrongdoing as extreme as those uncovered in 2022. That requires vigilance to transparency and recognition that journalists who dig into issues at relevant institutions are doing a service to the longer-term interests of this industry rather than undermining it.",2022/12/30

6,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Three days before the close of 2022, bitcoin inched proudly upward. Solana continued to tailspin before erasing losses late in the day, while other cryptos were mixed.Insights: Mark Connors, head of research for digital asset manager 3iQ, sees a crypto rebound by the third quarter of 2023 and financial services firms and others playing a more proactive role in the development of regulation.Bitcoin Remains Defiant at the Close of a Dreadful YearBy James RubinOn the third to last day of a historically, massively, tragically bad year, bitcoin held its head proudly if barely above water.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just above $16,630, up a few fractions of a percentage point over the past 24 hours. BTC has now been balancing roughly between $16,400 and $17,000 for 13 days amid investor sluggishness typical for a year's closing days. Crypto markets would also rather forget acquaintances – auld and new – to 2022 even as they gird for more rough times ahead in 2023.""Bitcoin continues to happily tread water and watch the storm pass as it fluctuates in a range of around $16,000-$17,000,"" wrote Craig Erlam, senior markets editor for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, in an email. ""That's broadly been the case over the last couple of weeks and it doesn't look like changing in the coming days, barring any unexpected headlines.""Erlam added: ""The question for many now is whether it has bottomed and how long it will take confidence to return, enabling a strong recovery. I'm not convinced by either in the near term and think there are plenty more twists and turns to come early next year.""Ether was recently changing hands slightly below $1,200 but up 0.8% from Wednesday, same time. Other major cryptos were mixed with ETC, the token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain project, rising about 4% and popular meme coin SHIB up nearly 3%, but SOL's sad saga continuing, with the token of the embattled Solana blockchain, plummeting more than 12% at one point. SOL erased those losses after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik tweeted his support for the platform, but has dropped almost 20% over the past week from over $12 to nearly $9.70, and is off more than 90% since Jan. 1. SOL's decline has largely stemmed from Solana's ties to the collapses of the Terra ecosystem and crypto exchange FTX.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently jumped 0.21%.Equity indexes closed 2022's penultimate trading day on a high with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 climbing 2.6% and 1.7%, respectively.

In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program on Thursday, Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at crypto sleuthing firm TRM Labs, said that cracking down on crypto hacks will require hardening cyber defenses.

""Look at some of the darlings that people were really excited about 18 months ago in stocks, they’ve lost 80-90% of their value as well.”Fund Manager 3iQ Has 3 Bold Predictions for 2023By James RubinA year ago, before the crumbling of the Terra ecosystem, the implosion of Three Arrows Capital and crypto lending platform Celsius and disgrace of exchange giant FTX, who could have foreseen that the digital asset industry would be limping home in 2022. A year ago, bitcoin was still percolating over $47,000 and seemed likely to remain unruffled by the economic headwinds already buffeting the world.What's in store in 2023?In an interview with CoinDesk, Mark Connors, head of research for Canadian crypto asset manager, said he expects a price rebound in 2023 and TradFi companies and others to play a more active role not only in finding uses for blockchain technology but in the development of regulation. ""Leadership will come from the corporate side, not the regulatory side,"" Connors said.CoinDesk: What's your first prediction for 2023?Connors: Leadership will come from the corporate side, not the regulatory side. We're looking for regulatory clarity so that investment firms can own coins and invest in existing Layer 1s. Whether whether it be bitcoin, Ethereum or Layer 1s, we believe the incentive structures of companies will make them take a leadership role and act and not wait for legislation to both continue to create their own industry blockchains as well as leverage the existing Ethereum EVM, and to a lesser degree, the bitcoin blockchain as they transfer both B2B and B2C functionality to blockchains. That was the most silent, underreported action in 2022. TradFi is going to lead the charge, not native crypto and not regulatory agencies. That's going to be the curveball.CoinDesk: What else do you foresee for the year ahead?Connors: 2023 will be a barbell for digital assets. It will be the core Layer 1s, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and it will be the use of NFTs by TradFi companies, which is a corollary to my first point. In 2022, the ecosystem was you had your alt level ones like Solana, Algorand and the like providing the bulk of the non-Bitcoin, Etherium, stablecoin market cap. Seventy percent of market cap in digital assets of the last 12 months. So that 30% of market cap is going to shift from alt level ones and level twos and other projects to be more NFT related. The NFT technology from a security and verification standpoint has greater integrity, and a higher trust and security factor. Given it can be nested with the Etherium ecosystem and can be bridged, it will have functionality and security. I think you'll see the most growth in NFTs.CoinDesk: What's going to happen to crypto prices? Do you see a rebound, and if so, when?Connors: We are so dollar based. Dollar strength destroys risk assets. The Fed has two mandates, price stability and full employment. But they have taken on a third mandate. They have a trilemma, which is wonderful because no economic system can run on two poles. My third prediction is that before the third quarter, the Fed will stop quantitative tightening. They will stop because the Treasury market would have experienced a failure like September 2019. Money markets will crack, the Fed will print and crypto will reverse as sharply as it did in March 2020. We're still young as a market.

7,"Although the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, bitcoin (BTC), saw a roughly 64% decline in value year-to-date, CoinDesk research shows that bitcoin and ether returns in 2022 per unit of risk were about the same as equities and significantly better than bonds.“We want to underscore this is not too different from what you would see in traditional markets, especially stock markets,” said Andrew Baehr, CoinDesk Indices managing director, on First Mover CoinDeskTV.“Look at some of the darlings that people were really excited about 18 months ago in stocks, they’ve lost 80-90% of their value as well.”Bitcoin and ether appeared to be affected by the same forces that made stock investing a challenge over the past year, including high inflation and the looming threat of recession. According to CoinDesk data, stocks were nearly twice as risky in 2022 as 2021.When looking at what caused this, Baehr said in a research report, that liquidity has to be the number one candidate. “When you look back at the negative events in the cryptocurrency industry it’s not too hard to draw an arrow to quickly deteriorating liquidity conditions as a partial cause,” said Baehr.",2022/12/29
8,"Blockchain project Stacks has published a whitepaper showing how a new digital asset called “Stacks bitcoin” (sBTC) can be used to make Bitcoin fully programmable.Unlike Ethereum or Solana where developers can conjure up all manner of algorithmic machinations – think six-figure gorilla avatars – Bitcoin’s simpler scripting language limits what Bitcoin developers can create on the platform.Stacks, an existing smart contract platform, wants to break through those limitations by introducing a new digital asset derived from bitcoin – sBTC (pegged at 1:1 with bitcoin) – that can be used to create smart contracts on Stacks, but can also be readily converted back to bitcoin (BTC).“Bitcoin is, by design, relatively slow and does not natively provide the fully-expressive smartcontracts needed to build sophisticated applications,” the whitepaper states. “Faster and more sophisticated applications must therefore be built outside of the base layer. Bitcoin layers enable this.”Read more: Smart Contract Platforms: Past, Present and FutureThe term “layers” is Stacks’ lingo for any system outside of Bitcoin’s base layer, such as a sidechain, which is a secondary blockchain that interacts with a primary blockchain. In the whitepaper, Stacks acts as a Bitcoin sidechain, powered by both sBTC and STX – Stacks’ native token.The project claims in its white paper that its Bitcoin sidechain can unlock “hundreds of billions of dollars” in DeFi on Bitcoin.The concept is still in the implementation phase and will be formalized under Stacks Improvement Proposal (SIP) 21, according to Stacks co-founder, Muneeb Ali.“The vote went through and implementation has started,” Ali confirmed during an interview with CoinDesk.”This is going to be the next major release. My best guess is maybe eight to nine months from now.”The current Stacks protocol uses a consensus mechanism (how computers agree on the state of a network) called “proof of transfer,” where anyone can be a miner or “stacker.”Miners earn STX rewards for mining Stacks blocks, but must first post bitcoin to earn mining privileges. That bitcoin is subsequently distributed as a reward to stackers who maintain a copy of the Stacks ledger; stackers must also lock up STX for a certain length of time to receive stacking privileges.In the proposed sBTC peg system, users send regular bitcoin to a wallet controlled by stackers (a process referred to as “pegging in”). This action mints an equivalent number of sBTC that can be used in smart contracts on Stacks.To get their bitcoin back (“pegging out”), users return sBTC to the wallet. Stackers then sign these peg out requests and release the equivalent amount of bitcoin back to the users. This also prompts the Stacks protocol to burn the corresponding sBTC.“It's a fully trustless system. It's a protocol,” says Ali. “There is a dynamic set of signers who have economic incentives to be signers and they sign the peg transactions.”Bitcoin sidechains aren’t new. Blockstream, a Bitcoin infrastructure firm, published a whitepaper on sidechains as early as 2014, and currently has a fully functional sidechain federation called Liquid.Earlier this month, Layer 2 Labs raised a $3 million seed round from angel investors to develop “drivechains,” another flavor of Bitcoin sidechains.Read more: Bitcoin Development Company Layer 2 Labs Raises $3M to Bring Drivechains to NetworkIn addition, Bitcoin developer Ruben Somsen has been working on “spacechains,” which he describes as “one-way pegged sidechains for Bitcoin.”So what new innovation does sBTC bring to the sidechains conversation? Ali claims the sBTC model is unique in that anyone can be a miner or stacker. He sees the use of STX to incentivize stackers to sign peg out requests as a distinct advantage, although alternative projects tend to avoid the use of altcoins such as STX like the plague.“It's a trade off,” Ali explains. “The trade off you're making with Liquid is that users need to trust Blockstream and friends – the federation. On Stacks, because there is the extra [STX] token, there is no company in the middle. So you can pick one; you can't have both.”",2022/12/29
9,"Cracking down on crypto hacks will require hardening cyber defenses, Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at crypto sleuthing firm TRM Labs, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Thursday.Redbord, a former prosecutor for the Department of Justice, said that finding strategies to identify and trace illicit activity will mean developing better “blockchain intelligence tools” that can identify new mixers before bad actors can get to them.“Bad guys are getting better, and their tactics are becoming more sophisticated,” Redbord said. “But the reality is the tools, regulation and the investigators and law enforcement are also becoming more sophisticated.”Read more: This Was the Worst Year for Crypto Hacks. Here’s How 2023 Can Be Better / OpinionAccording to TRM Labs, more than $3.6 billion in funds have been drained in crypto this year. About 80%, or roughly $3 billion, targeted decentralized finance (DeFi).That's because many DeFi platforms are new and haven't developed robust cybersecurity tools yet and because the platforms have a lot of liquidity, he said.During the same segment on ""First Mover,"" Erin Plante, vice president of investigations at Chainalysis, another crypto sleuthing firm, said that many attacks are occurring on bridges that are used to transfer assets between different platforms.Chainalysis found that “sophistication in money laundering” is becoming harder to decipher as bad actors look to cash out on centralized exchanges that are likely to be unaware that the funds are stolen because the bad actors have hidden the funds' source through the use of multiple mixers.Crypto mixers, which operate like black boxes, give users the ability to send and receive bitcoin (BTC) anonymously.“There’s really a need to continue to evolve the intelligence and the tools to be able to identify the new mixers that are popping up in those places,” Plante said.Read more: Are Crypto Mixers Legal? / Opinion",2022/12/29
10,"Even as cryptocurrency and other digital assets resident on blockchain have increasingly permeated the public consciousness, the question of regulatory authority has largely gone unanswered. Often, seismic events in the financial industry, like the collapse of FTX, lead to clarity.Here, unfortunately, instead of leading to any kind of consensus, the early signs indicate that the demise of FTX and its repercussions on other crypto companies have only reinforced the disagreements between the different stakeholders on how, or even whether, to regulate crypto.Aitan Goelman is a partner with Zuckerman Spaeder, LLP and the former Director of Enforcement at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This article is part of Crypto 2023.By now, most people are familiar with the saga of FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder, majority owner, and, until recently, wunderkind CEO of the now-defunct crypto exchange. Before his abrupt fall from grace, “SBF,” as Bankman-Fried has become known, had the ear of public officials, regulators and celebrities, and a public image as the kinder, gentler, face of crypto.After a November 2022 article in Coindesk reported that the bulk of the holdings of Alameda Research, SBF’s trading firm, were in FTX’s token, a run on the bank was triggered. That led to SBF’s resignation and forced FTX and related entities into bankruptcy, with FTX’s customers and investors out billions of dollars. SBF was subsequently indicted in the Southern District of New York (S.D.N.Y.) for a variety of crimes, including wire fraud, conspiracy and money-laundering, stemming from his alleged use of assets belonging to FTX’s customers to plug a shortfall in Alameda and his alleged lies to investors.Read more: 2023 Will Be the Death of Bitcoin Energy FUD | OpinionThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed enforcement actions against SBF as well, alleging that his actions violated the securities laws and the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), respectively.Until FTX’s demise, it and SBF had been seen as the white knights of the crypto world, repeatedly riding to the rescue of other troubled companies in the sector. This made some contagion from FTX’s collapse inevitable, although to this point, the damage appears largely confined to other crypto companies, customers and investors, rather than to the traditional financial system.It is worth noting that, while SBF is now incarcerated and faces a potentially lengthy prison term and unfavorable comparisons to Bernie Madoff, he had previously been a champion of increased regulation of the crypto markets, including by lending his support to proposed federal legislation which would have undoubtedly prohibited much of his conduct, including the use of customer funds to prop up Alameda.There has never been a dedicated regulator of crypto, at least in the U.S. Various federal agencies, including the Department of Treasury, the SEC and the CFTC, each have different pieces of regulatory responsibility. Certain state agencies have carved out roles for themselves as well, with the New York Department of Financial Services, for example, issuing its own “BitLicenses.”In this patchwork of different regulatory authority, the legal basis for the CFTC’s jurisdiction is clearest. The Commission has repeatedly held that crypto can be a commodity under § 1(a)(9) of the CEA, which falls under its regulatory umbrella, and this interpretation has been endorsed by federal courts as well. As a result, the CFTC has asserted its regulatory authority over crypto derivatives, and its anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement authority over transactions in spot crypto.There has been considerably less consistency in the SEC’s approach to crypto. In the last administration, the SEC seemed relatively uninterested in crypto. Its only notable effort was to belatedly take action against the spate of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), which were fairly clearly unregistered securities offerings, but eschewing any attempt to more broadly regulate crypto.The SEC has been far more aggressive under Chair Gensler, who has repeatedly suggested that the vast majority of tokens are securities. Gensler’s Enforcement Division has launched a host of investigations into different tokens and has adopted an expensive interpretation of “investment contracts” under SEC v. Howey, 328 U.S. 293 (1946).See also: The Next Wave of Institutional Digital Asset Adoption | OpinionDespite this, the SEC’s ability to show that these tokens are actually securities under current law is far from certain. The agency did manage to persuade a New Hampshire district court that the cryptocurrency LBRY was a security. However, it is facing a stiff challenge in SEC v. Ripple, 20 CIV 10832 (S.D.N.Y. 2020), where the defense, led by former SEC Chair Mary Jo White and former Enforcement Director Andrew Ceresney, are arguing that Ripple’s token is not a security by using public statements (and, now, internal SEC communications) made by another former top SEC official, William Hinman, about why Ether did not qualify as an “investment contract” under Howey.This has resulted in an unusually public turf battle between the CFTC and SEC, and even led CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham to issue a statement condemning the SEC’s decision to bring charges in SEC v. Wahi. Quoting Federalist No. 49, Commissioner Pham called the SEC action “a striking example of ‘regulation by enforcement,’” and encouraged the CFTC to use “all means available” to enforce the CEA in the crypto space.In this regard, the SBF charges can be seen as a victory for CFTC. Although the SEC charged SBF with securities fraud, it is related to lies he told to FTX investors, something that is inarguably in the SEC’s wheelhouse. The SEC did not allege that the underlying crypto itself – FTT – was a security, while both the CFTC and the S.D.N.Y. alleged that crypto is a commodity.All three agencies subsequently filed consent charges against SBF’s accomplices and confidantes Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, both of whom are cooperating with the government against SBF.Notably, the SEC did charge Ellison and Wang with manipulating FTT, which the agency described as a “crypto asset security.” The CFTC didn’t address the legal status of FTT in particular, but cited bitcoin, ether and tether as examples of “digital asset commodities.”This pattern of charges could indicate the early outlines of an agreed-upon division between the agencies for tokens that are considered “securities” and those that are not, with the SEC claiming jurisdiction over the former and the CFTC over the latter.However, the fact that the SEC defined FTT as a “security” in its charges against Ellison and Yang, but not in its case against SBF, demonstrates that the agency is bolder in pressing its expansive definition of “crypto asset securities” when it knows it won’t have to fight that issue in front of a judge.Prior to FTX’s implosion, there seemed to be an emerging consensus (or something close to it) that Congress should establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto. This included the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which in October 2022 recommended that Congress pass legislation to provide federal regulators with rule-making authority over the spot market for “crypto assets that are not securities.”The FSOC did not say which regulator should be given such authority, but it appears that it had the CFTC in mind. Further, securities were excluded from the recommended regulatory authority, a move that clearly seemed designed to reassure the SEC that there would be no encroachment on its territory.There are two major pieces of draft crypto legislation circulating on the Hill, and both explicitly provide the CFTC with regulatory authority over large parts of the spot crypto markets.The Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (“DCCPA”), introduced in August by Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and John Boozman (R-AR), extends the CFTC’s regulatory authority to spot crypto. While the bill defines certain cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, as commodities, it offers no detailed guidance on what crypto assets would be classified as “securities,” which the bill exempts from CFTC jurisdiction.To pass, this bill will have to overcome SBF’s earlier public endorsement – a boon at the time, but now may taint the legislation by association.The Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA), sponsored by Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), goes even further toward endorsing the CFTC as the primary crypto regulator. It gives the agency oversight over digital assets that are not securities and lays out fairly restrictive standards for determining that a crypto asset is a security.The senators noted in a joint press release that “understanding that most digital assets are much more similar to commodities than securities, the bill gives the CFTC clear authority over applicable digital asset spot markets” – leaving little doubt as to their intent and openly differing with Chair Gensler’s public statements.Beyond these differences, the two bills have many provisions in common. Both would allow the CFTC to self-fund by imposing user fees on crypto companies, an ability which mimics an authority the SEC has long had and which could be a game changer for the perpetually cash-strapped agency.The last time Congress significantly expanded the CFTC’s responsibilities – when the Dodd-Frank bill brought swaps under the agency’s ambit after the financial crisis of 2008-09 – the CFTC’s budget did not keep pace with its enlarged remit.The ability to impose user fees would help ensure that the CFTC, whose budget (about $320 million) is still a rounding error compared to that of the SEC (approximately $2 billion), can effectively carry out its enhanced mission.Another feature shared by both pieces of draft legislation is the establishment of a new self-regulatory organization (SRO) exclusively for the crypto markets. This is something former CFTC Chair Tim Massad has said should be done regardless of what happens in Congress, and he has suggested that it be overseen jointly by the SEC and CFTC.The collapse of FTX and its knock-on effects in the broader crypto industry has led to renewed calls for urgent action by Congress. But it hasn’t led to unanimity, or even consensus, about the need for legislation, much less how to regulate the industry.Instead, it has largely reinforced the positions already held by the various stakeholders. SEC Chair Gensler has used the FTX saga to reiterate his position that the SEC already has regulatory authority over most coins, and it simply needs more money to do the job.In contrast, CFTC Chair Benham, in congressional testimony soon after FTX declared bankruptcy, noted that the CFTC-regulated American subsidiary of FTX (FTX US Derivatives – once known as LedgerX) was still solvent, demonstrating the effectiveness of CFTC supervision.Crypto enthusiasts reacted to the implosion of FTX by arguing that there are fraudsters in every industry. Some also noted that centralized exchanges like FTX are in many ways the antithesis of the ethos of crypto, which was intended to be a decentralized form of finance independent of the need to trust in institutions or other market participants.Unsurprisingly, the FTX saga hasn’t dented the faith of true crypto zealots, who continue to believe with almost religious ferocity that Web3 and blockchain represent one of the most consequential developments in human history – more important than the development of the internet, approximately equal to the discovery of fire, and perhaps slightly behind the invention of the wheel.More surprisingly, some hardcore crypto skeptics are pointing to the very limited contagion from the FTX collapse as evidence that crypto should not be regulated. They argue that if crypto is brought into the mainstream financial system, it would have the imprimatur of government approval and this would encourage more retail investors to speculate in crypto. As a result, the entire economy would be exposed to the volatility, money laundering, fraud and manipulation that are ubiquitous in (and, to some crypto haters, an inextricable part of) crypto.This regulatory debate illustrates the adage that “where you stand depends on where you sit.” Chairman Gensler, who was an aggressive proponent of the CFTC’s remit when he chaired that agency during the Obama Administration, now believes that virtually all crypto qualifies as a “security.” And then you have the chair and enforcement director of the SEC during the same administration, who are representing Ripple in its battle against the SEC and are among those arguing for a more limited interpretation of a “security.”Meanwhile, crypto companies continue to avoid U.S. jurisdiction. They do so primarily by moving offshore (the headquarters of FTX, like many crypto firms, was in the Bahamas) and by “geo-blocking” Americans, a technique that prohibits those the computer identifies as being located in the U.S. from accessing their platforms – but this is, of course, a far from hermetic seal against anyone with a VPN.The absence of legislation and regulation doesn’t mean the law surrounding crypto is stagnant – it continues to develop through litigation and the interpretation of various enforcement actions. But true clarity won’t come through the slow churn of the legal system, it will come through legislative action. Ironically, FTX’s collapse has, in some ways, complicated the path to Congressional action.In addition to the now-poisonous association with SBF, both draft bills are under renewed criticism for granting primary regulatory jurisdiction to the CFTC instead of the SEC.But suggestions that the CFTC is the crypto industry’s “regulator of choice” and more susceptible to capture by the industry simply don’t hold up against the facts. In 2022, more than 20% of the agency’s enforcement actions were related to crypto. Further, the CFTC sought – and, more often than not, successfully obtained – increasingly significant sanctions.Under its current funding structure, the agency undoubtedly does not have the resources to be fully effective. However, if any legislation retains a grant to the CFTC of authority to levy user fees on crypto actors, the agency’s efforts in the crypto sector will be even more robust.",2022/12/29

12,"Since crypto exchange FTX collapsed into bankruptcy and its Ponzi-like shell game with investor money was revealed, many commentators have doubled down on their criticism of cryptocurrencies as a type of Ponzi scheme.For those who need a review, Ponzi schemes start with an initial investment from an early round of investors, and the money is then used (and spent) for the purposes of the general partners or issuers of the investment product. When the time comes that the original investors want to withdraw their funds, their investments are returned through funds invested by subsequent rounds of investors, giving the illusion of solvency and returns.Similarly, FTX kept making funds available to earlier investors on its exchange using the deposits of subsequent investors – those earlier investments had been swept away to Alameda Research, an affiliated hedge fund.You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.The FTX revelations have led a chorus of voices – including actor Ben McKenzie and Nobel Laureate economist Paul Krugman – to allege that cryptocurrencies in general are a Ponzi scheme.Let’s be clear: Though bad actors are using cryptocurrencies as a medium with which to conduct Ponzi-like schemes, crypto itself isn't a Ponzi scheme.For one thing, tokens like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) do hold value, even in down markets and don't depend on inflows of new money to pay off investors. Rather, holders of these tokens can exchange them for other items of value, or fiat currency, any time they can find a counterparty willing to take their crypto.There is no central entity giving these tokens the illusion of value, but instead, the investing public’s willingness to pay $17,000 or $21,000 or $68,000 for one bitcoin determines the ultimate market value of the token.The most popular cryptocurrencies are able to deliver value in and of themselves without the manipulations of a Ponzi scheme operator.And as a reminder to financial advisors, cryptocurrencies do have fundamentals and real-world use cases.Here are a handful of functions that cryptocurrencies provide:As 2022 comes to a close, cryptocurrencies can be used as a medium of exchange at hundreds of retailers, including AMC Theatres, Virgin Galactic and Cheap Air. Many of these retailers use BitPay, a service that for a small fee converts crypto into the currency of a vendor’s choice within the flow of a transaction.Holders of bitcoin can also convert their coins into fiat cash at bitcoin ATMs or via a debit card prepaid with their tokens.And while many people argue that the volatility of bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies makes them unfit as a medium of exchange, stablecoins that don't fluctuate in value are on the rise.The reputation of stablecoins was tested this year with the collapse of some “algorithmic” stablecoins like Terra/UST. However, they still have the potential to overtake paper currency by accommodating fast, safe and precise digital payments. Central banks are taking this challenge seriously by working to develop digital currencies of their own.Using tokens for cross-border remittances continues to be one of the more popular uses for cryptocurrencies.While many critics have lambasted the volatility and uncertainty of cryptocurrencies compared with fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, many other international currencies suffer from high volatility and inflationary pressures far beyond those felt by the dollar.Tokens like bitcoin are still able to move across borders faster and cheaper than fiat currency.Blockchain technology and digital tokens are being applied to problems far beyond those involving investors, advisors, exchanges and digital broker-dealers.The technology is being applied to issues in real estate, agriculture, healthcare, gaming and supply-chain management, among others.Tokens, distributed through initial coin offerings, are programmable assets that use smart contracts to automatically execute transactions if certain conditions are met without the need of an intermediary. Many industries, not just financial, can benefit from smart contracts that eliminate the need for intermediaries.In 2022, Ethereum, the blockchain represented by ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, underwent a transformation from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain, offering holders of ether the opportunity to generate yield by “staking” transactions on the blockchain. As a result, it has become much easier for many crypto investors to take some income out of their holdings without selling a position.But so-called “yield-farming” opportunities have existed for several years in decentralized finance (DeFi). While some of these opportunities are rife with risk and potential fraud, others offer investors the chance to receive more income more efficiently than they would via low-risk stocks and bonds – even in the current higher interest rate regime.Many investors are going to bet that blockchain will continue to proliferate and that the demand for cryptocurrencies will increase again, driving prices upward from their 2022 swoon. While these may often be pie-in-the-sky hopes for easy money, some credible analysts also expect that the value of major tokens like bitcoin and ether will eventually begin to rise, perhaps growing beyond the peaks reached over a year ago.While advisors generally promote long-term investing over get-rich-quick speculation, for younger clients with high incomes or very high net worth, a little speculation on the potential growth of digital assets shouldn't seriously detract from their ability to reach long-term financial goals.",2022/12/29

Selling pressure on the tokens came because of their close links to disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces charges of fraud and misappropriation of client funds.Thursday's decline put SOL on track for nine straight days of losses, the longest run of declines since Sept. 17, 2021, based on Messari data.Since 2020, Bankman-Fried has been a major proponent of the Solana network, launching the decentralized exchange Serum on the then-upstart network and investing heavily in the platform's projects.Apart from prices, the value locked on Solana-based applications has declined 98% since November last year, DefiLlama data shows. Steep falls in Solana’s metrics came after the implosion of Terra network in May and a market-wide drop in July and after Bankman-Fried's FTX problems first came to light early last month.Alternative currencies outside of the top 20 tokens by market capitalization saw slight changes as well, except for toncoin (TON), which fell 5% over the past 24 hours, and luna classic (LUNC), which dropped 7%.Meanwhile, premarket futures for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 both inched 0.5% higher, pointing to possible gains when the U.S. markets open on Thursday.UPDATE (Dec. 29, 10:03 UTC): Adds SOL's streak of declines in fourth paragraph.",2022/12/29
14,"Several tokens held by Sam Bankman-Fried’s embattled trading business Alameda Research were sold late on Wednesday to the tune of millions of dollars, as the firm's founders face criminal charges related to the collapse of Alameda and FTX, the crypto exchange Bankman-Fried ran.On-chain data cited by crypto research firm Arkham Intelligence suggested $1.7 million worth of tokens from Alameda-linked wallets was sold in the open market over a span of several hours on Wednesday. That sparked concerns on Crypto Twitter that the sales would trigger a steep fall in the prices of those tokens.Bankman-Fried denied being the source of the sales in a tweet on Friday afternoon, saying ""I'm not and couldn't be moving any of those funds; I don't have access to them anymore.""On-chain data showed Ethereum-based tokens such as USD coin (USDC), dai (DAI), curve (CRV), ether (ETH), convex (CVX) and others were consolidated from several wallets to just two wallets and later sold for tether (USDT) stablecoin.The value of the transactions ranged from a fraction of an ether to over 15 ether, the on-chain data shows. The holdings were then converted into bitcoin (BTC) using swapping services like FixedFloat and ChangeNow, on-chain sleuth ZachXBT noted in a tweet.According to Arkham Intelligence data, Alameda still holds over $112 million worth of various cryptocurrencies, down from $140 million held in mid-November, as CoinDesk previously reported.FTX filed for bankruptcy in November after revelations that Alameda, a hedge fund that Bankman-Fried also owned, was largely backed by FTT tokens, digital assets that FTX created out of thin air.UPDATE (Dec. 30, 19:49 UTC): Updated with tweet from Sam Bankman-Fried.",2022/12/29
15,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin, ether and most other major cryptocurrencies spent Wednesday in the red.Insights: In this last week of 2022, First Mover Asia is revisiting a few of CoinDesk's most noteworthy columns. In his latest Crypto Long and Short newsletter, CoinDesk research analyst George Kaloudis considered five of the most annoying events and trends in 2022. Unsurprisingly, topping his list, Kaloudis wrote of his anger at FTX.Another Gloomy Day for BitcoinBy James RubinBitcoin added another dollop of gloom to an already gloomy year on Wednesday.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently down a percentage point over the past 24 hours to about $16,500. BTC has been clinging closer to $17,000 since mid-December amid market concerns about the latest macroeconomic uncertainties and the increased likelihood of Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates.In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Brent Xu, founder and CEO of cross-chain DeFi (decentralized-finance) hub Umee, said that markets seem to be destined to continue their declines well into 2023. ""Markets are going to bottom out around Q2 to Q3,"" Xu said. ""We're going to see another six to 12 months of negative sentiment, possibly 18 months.""Still, he added that he expects ""better developments"" in the long term.Ether was recently changing hands at just under $1,200 for a second consecutive day, off more than 2% from the day before. Other major cryptos were largely in the red amid tepid trading that is typical for most assets as a year closes. SOL, the token of the Solana blockchain, and APT, the native cryptocurrency of the Aptos blockchain system were down more than 11% and 10%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently fell 1.86%.U.S. equity indexes slipped slightly as investors chewed over the implications of China reopening its borders after months of Covid-related lockdowns. The tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a hefty technology component, declined 1.4% and 1.2%, respectively. Stocks usually trade sideways at this time of the year, although a massive sell-off of Tesla's (TSLA) stock this month and Southwest Airlines' (LUV) mass cancellations may alter this traditional course.For at least one day, a couple of faintly positive stories replaced the latest developments in crypto exchange FTX's crisis among industry headlines. Bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK) avoided filing for bankruptcy protection after agreeing to sell its Dickens Country, Texas mining facility to Galaxy Digital for $65 million and securing a $35 million loan from the crypto-focused financial-services firm.Earlier in the day (Hong Kong time), CoinDesk also reported that MicroStrategy (MSTR), the business software vendor that was co-founded by crypto proponent Michael Saylor, has added to its bitcoin stockpile, purchasing about 2,395 bitcoins for $42.8 million between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21 through its MacroStrategy subsidiaryUmee's Xu said that the recent uptick in macroeconomic conditions and crypto price stability has been troublesome for options trading. ""If you're an options trader, not a lot of volatility,"" Xu said. ""Whenever there's any price movements, they're not going to be sustained long enough form some notable trend.""It's just not the best time for investing in crypto assets,"" he added.5 Crypto Things That Riled Me Up in 2022By George KaloudisEnclosed are just five of the crypto-related things that got under my skin in 2022.

The FTX/Alameda/SBF fraudThis is probably the umpteen-millionth time you have read some version of a crypto person being mad about this, but I’m still mad at FTX (for the fraud), the reckless risk-takers (for the flexing) and many Twitter-ers (for the hero worship). I think the fraud speaks for itself. The embezzlement (or whatever it was) at FTX hurt real people.

Crypto hedge fund founders flexingMy brain is raising at least two pitchforks for the folks at crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). It’s one thing to be a little annoyed with highly leveraged hedge funds (like 3AC) doing risky things in general; it’s another to be annoyed at the associated flexing (i.e., “showing off”) that took place on social media and elsewhere as highly leveraged hedge funds raked in the cash the last few years.But it was revealed during liquidation proceedings that 3AC co-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu paid for a $50 million superyacht with company funds all while flexing that “100K ETH is dust.” Calling 100,000 ether “dust” was calling $400 million “not a lot of money.” 3AC collapsed.

16,"Debate has accelerated in recent days over the future prospects of Solana, a layer 1 smart-contract blockchain that in some respects competes with Ethereum. The chain grew rapidly and saw immense hype during the 2020-2021 bull market, particularly from venture capitalists. But the recent departure of major projects to other chains and a massive drop in total value on the Solana chain have raised questions about its future prospects.Lingering technological challenges are a common worry cited by doubters. Competition from Ethereum layer 2s represent a growing threat to Solana’s core premise of faster and lower-cost transactions. But the biggest cloud shading Solana’s sunshine is the fall of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the FTX exchange and hedge fund Alameda Research.David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.Bankman-Fried was perhaps the single most prominent backer of Solana, and skeptics could reasonably argue that the price appreciation of the SOL token and related assets from 2020-2021 was driven at least in part by Bankman-Fried’s market interventions and advocacy.The consequences of growing Solana skepticism have been dire, based purely on numbers. From a peak price of $258.78 on Nov. 6, 2021, Solana’s SOL token has declined to just over $10. That’s a drop of 96%, vastly sharper than the drawdown from peak for BTC (-74.5%) and ETH (-74.6%). It’s even a sharper drop, incredibly, than dogecoin (DOGE) has seen in the bear market – the meme coin is down a mere 76% from its October 2021 local high, though it's 87% down from its May 2021 all-time high.From its position as the fifth-most valuable crypto token in early November, Solana’s SOL token has dropped to 19th place, according to data from CoinGecko.See also: Solana DeFi Project Mercurial to Relaunch, Replace TokenThe total value of tokens staked in decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocols on Solana has declined even more dramatically, from nearly $10.2 billion on Nov. 9, 2021 to under $210 million at press time – a decline of nearly 98%. Solana is now only the 12th-largest DeFi chain by total value locked or TVL, trailing not only Ethereum layer 2s like Polygon and Optimism, but also far more obscure projects like Cronos and DefiChain.The single sharpest percentage drop in Solana’s metrics came in early November following the collapse of FTX, and mounting evidence of massive fraud by Sam Bankman-Fried. It now seems increasingly likely that some of Bankman-Fried’s extensive support for the chain was funded via FTX’s wholesale theft of customer funds.Former Alameda executives including CEO Caroline Ellison, moreover, have claimed in recent statements to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that Bankman-Fried encouraged market manipulation of FTX’s FTT token. Given that, it seems improbable that Bankman-Fried wasn't also manipulating the price of Solana-based projects he helped launch, controlled large stakes in and used in the accounting and loan fraud that formed the core of the FTX swindle.Those related projects, including the Serum decentralized exchange and the self-described DeFi brokerage Oxygen, are sometimes derisively referred to as “Samcoins.” They have seen catastrophic declines in their own token prices, and Serum was rendered “defunct” by the collapse of FTX, necessitating a community fork.Market manipulation via Alameda would have effectively been funded by the clandestine redirection of FTX customer funds from other assets, such as bitcoin and ether, toward the trading of SOL or other ecosystem tokens. Alameda’s market-making and trading activities as a whole appear in retrospect to have been wildly unprofitable. Some critics have argued that their SOL activity would have amounted to propping up the value of Solana, while artificially holding down the price of blue chips like ETH and BTC.This chaos has led to hints of something like a death spiral as developers and projects depart the struggling chain. Most dramatically, the DeGods and Y00ts NFT (non-fungible token) projects were confirmed to be leaving Solana for Ethereum and Polygon, respectively. In November, stablecoin issuer Tether swapped $1 billion of USDT from Solana to Ethereum.All this comes on top of worries that predated the collapse of FTX. Solana has experienced repeated chain halts since its inception, often caused by “botting” or other forms of spam overwhelming the network. This is inextricably linked to Solana’s core value proposition as a faster, cheaper layer 1 than Ethereum: For a blockchain, lower transaction costs and higher speed often come as a trade-off for security and stability.See also: Is Solana Leading Crypto Into Retail or Trailing Apple? | OpinionMoreover, that value proposition may itself be less compelling than it was when Solana launched in March 2020. The years since have seen significant growth in “layer 2” products on Ethereum that offer faster and less expensive transactions, but gain the benefit of Ethereum’s security, mostly through the use of “rollup” technology. Those new competitors include Optimism, a layer 2 that launched in December 2021 and now has more than twice as much value locked as Solana.These are serious headwinds, and commentators across the crypto industry have been debating the chain’s prospects in recent days. In a best-case scenario, Solana’s remaining builders face a long road back to ecosystem health and relevance. The big question is whether there are enough of them, with enough conviction, to go the distance.",2022/12/28
17,"MicroStrategy (MSTR), the business software vendor that was co-founded by crypto proponent Michael Saylor, has added to its bitcoin (BTC) stockpile, purchasing about 2,395 bitcoins for $42.8 million between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21 through its MacroStrategy subsidiary, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday.Last Thursday, the company sold about 704 bitcoins for $11.8 million on the premise that a loss on the transaction would offset previous capital gains.Then on Saturday, the company acquired an additional 810 bitcoins for $13.6 million, bringing its total holdings up to 132,500 bitcoins.

""This deal with Galaxy achieves all of these goals, and it lets us live to fight another day.""The transaction will help Argo bolster its balance sheet and avoid bankruptcy after it found itself in a precarious situation when a deal for $27 million in funding fell through in October. Earlier this month, the miner said that it was in advanced negotiations to sell some of its assets and carry out an equipment financing transaction to avoid filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.The deal with Galaxy was structured to boost Argo's balance sheet and capital structure, Chris Ferraro, president and chief investment officer at Galaxy, told CoinDesk. When the miner kicked off its process, ""we were in a position to solve the problem completely for Argo, while accelerating the expansion of our own mining capabilities,” he added.The crypto miner's shares more than doubled in early London Stock Exchange trading. On Tuesday, the company requested a 24-hour suspension of trading in its Nasdaq-listed stock, while the London market was closed for a U.K. bank holiday.Argo is among several miners that are struggling to stay afloat amid rising energy costs low bitcoin (BTC) prices.Earlier this month, Core Scientific (CORZ), one of the largest miners by computing power, filed for bankruptcy, and in September, Compute North, another major firm in the sector, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Last week, bitcoin miner Greenidge said that it reached a debt restructuring deal with its lender Nydig, although the prospects of a bankruptcy filing still loom.Helios, which was Argo's largest mining facility, has up to 180 megawatts worth of power capacity and will become Galaxy's flagship mining operation.

Less than a month after a CD story led to the implosion of crypto exchange giant FTX in November, Chief Insights Columnist David Z.

And sign up for First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.Frozen Markets, a Bitcoin DriftBy James RubinBitcoin drifted lower in Tuesday trading, albeit not by much as investors continued their historical, year-end hibernation. Crypto prices remain frozen near the levels they've held for much of the past two weeks.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently changing hands at $16,700, off 1.3% over the past 24 hours but near its most recent support just under $17,000. BTC's price has remained resilient over the past two months, despite the widening fallout from the implosion of crypto exchange FTX.In a CoinDesk TV First Mover interview, Martin Leinweber, digital asset product strategist at Market Vector Indexes, noted bitcoin's strength relative to other cryptos. ""If you look at the coins that demonstrate relative strength, which means coins that fell the least amount from the all-time high, you will notice names that nearly no one would have imagined, especially when you consider the ranking,"" Leinweber said. ""So bitcoin was not the most defensive coin, one might expect from a store of value.""Ether was recently trading just over $1,200, also down 1.3% from Monday, same time. Most other major cryptos were slightly in the red with LINK, the token of software platform Chainlink, and CRO, the native cryptocurrency of exchange Crypto.com, each sinking more than 2%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, fell 1.15%.Major equity indexes closed mixed after a good news, bad news day in which China announced it would allow international travelers to enter the country again but Russia said it would ban oil sales to countries that had placed a $60 per barrel price cap on it – the latest fallout from Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. How the moves will affect prices worldwide is uncertain. Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of global energy markets, was recently selling at $85 per barrel, an 11% gain over the past three weeks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 1.4%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up slightly.Meanwhile, FTX's sad, unsavory saga continued with documents filed in Caribbean court showing that former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars from Alameda Research to purchase his stake in trading app Robinhood Markets (HOOD).In an affidavit before his arrest, Bankman-Fried said he and FTX co-founder Gary Wang together borrowed over $546 million from Alameda via promissory notes in April and May. They used that money to capitalize Emergent Fidelity Technologies Ltd., the shell corporation that in May bought a 7.6% stake of Robinhood.The FTX crisis has renewed calls for stronger regulation some seven months after the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin lost its dollar peg. The consequent collapse of the Terra ecosystem during the spring jolted lawmakers who had been hesitating to create stricter guidelines targeting digital assets to ratchet up their efforts. As yet, little concrete has resulted, although many crypto insiders expect changes in the year ahead and beyond to protect investors.Market Vector Indexes' Leinweber said he would embrace stablecoin regulation. ""I welcome those regulations,"" he said. ""It will lead to more dollars in that space. There are some unregulated, poorer constructed ones. But they're also good stablecoins.""FTX’s Collapse Was a Crime, Not an AccidentBy David Z. Morris, CoinDesk Chief Insights ColumnistIn the weeks since Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency empire was revealed to be a house of lies, mainstream news organizations and commentators have often failed to give their readers a straightforward assessment of exactly what happened. August institutions including the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have uncovered many key facts about the scandal, but they have also repeatedly seemed to downplay the facts in ways that soft-pedaled Bankman-Fried’s intent and culpability.It is now clear that what happened at the FTX crypto exchange and the hedge fund Alameda Research involved a variety of conscious and intentional fraud intended to steal money from both users and investors. That’s why a recent New York Times interview was widely derided for seeming to frame FTX’s collapse as the result of mismanagement rather than malfeasance. A Wall Street Journal article bemoaned the loss of charitable donations from FTX, arguably propping up Bankman-Fried’s strategic philanthropic pose. Vox co-founder Matthew Yglesias, court chronicler of the neoliberal status quo, seemed to whitewash his own entanglements by crediting Bankman-Fried’s money with helping Democrats in the 2020 elections – sidestepping the likelihood that the money was effectively embezzled.Perhaps most perniciously, many outlets have described what happened to FTX as a “bank run” or a “run on deposits,” while Bankman-Fried has repeatedly insisted the company was simply overleveraged and disorganized. Both of these attempts to frame the fallout obfuscate the core issue: the misuse of customer funds.Banks can be hit by “bank runs” because they are explicitly in the business of lending customer funds out to generate returns. They can experience a short-term cash crunch if everyone withdraws at the same time, without there being any long-term problem.But FTX and other crypto exchanges are not banks. They do not (or should not) do bank-style lending, so even a very acute surge of withdrawals should not create a liquidity strain. FTX had specifically promised customers it would never lend out or otherwise use the crypto they entrusted to the exchange.CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist David Z. Morris unpacks his latest opinion piece that argues Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of troubled crypto exchange FTX, is a fraud.See also: Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried's Crypto Empire Blur on Alameda's Balance SheetIn reality, the funds were sent to the intimately linked trading firm Alameda Research, where they were, it seems, simply gambled away. This is, in the simplest terms, theft at a nearly unprecedented scale. While the total losses have yet to be quantified, up to one million customers could be impacted, according to a bankruptcy document.Read the full story here11 p.m. HKT/SGT(3 p.m. UTC): U.S. Pending Home Sales (Nov.

21,"Midas Investments, an investment firm that focused on DeFi (decentralized-finance) yields, is shutting down its platform following its losses this year, according to a blog post from CEO and founder Iakov “Trevor” Levin on Tuesday.Levin wrote that this past spring, the Midas DeFi portfolio lost $50 million, or 20% of its $250 million in assets under management, and that after the collapse of crypto lender Celsius Network and exchange FTX, 60% of the assets on Midas' platform were withdrawn.“Based on this situation and current CeFi market conditions, we have reached the difficult decision to close the platform,” Levin wrote, referring to centralized finance.The company will now focus on a new project that “aligns with our vision for” centralized decentralized finance (CeDeFi), Levin said.Starting on Tuesday, Midas disabled deposits and swaps, as well as withdrawals, for some time while it makes calculations and balance adjustments. Its target is to deduct 55% from user balances held in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and stablecoins, with the adjustment being compensated for in MIDAS tokens that can be swapped in for tokens of its new project.“The goal of the new project is to create a win-win situation by connecting competing protocols with liquidity and offering a simplified yield to a range of DeFi and CeFi audiences,” Levin wrote.Levin is a contributor to CoinDesk.",2022/12/27
22,"The policy environment for crypto in 2022 began full steam ahead. The industry had grown significantly, institutional adoption was growing by leaps and bounds and policymakers had taken notice. Many of the players on the financial side of crypto, including the exchanges and those building financial products on blockchain, ramped up their involvement in the policy conversation in Washington, D.C.Policymakers that had been historically skeptical began to see the value of the technology and the growing impact it could have on traditional financial markets. Critics were being increasingly sidelined, given the perception of tremendous opportunities in the space, and friendly regulation appeared to be in the offing. With regulatory certainty being addressed, the industry could flourish. In May 2022, that positivity in the policy community came to a screeching halt.Chris Hayes is a senior government relations executive focused on financial regulation. He previously led global government relations for a layer 1 blockchain. This article is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.The collapse of Terra’s UST stablecoin (which, behind closed doors, some in Web3 talked about as being inevitable) as well as that of many centralized lending platforms in the crypto space sent the industry into a cold winter and provided a strong narrative to skeptics of not only the crypto industry but, worse, the usefulness of blockchain technology itself. The implosion of FTX in November has provided more fuel to this narrative, with significant consequences for policy making. An organization that presented itself as the poster child for responsible management and consumer protection turned out to be a house of cards, even worse than the Enron example.For all the losses to depositors, customers and damages to the industry’s reputation, the FTX implosion surprisingly has also resulted in an opportunity. There now appears to be some bipartisan consensus in the U.S. Congress that new digital assets legislation is needed to protect consumers. The 118th Congress that begins its work in January will likely pass some sort of regulatory framework for crypto and blockchain technology in 2023 or 2024. This framework will shape the way the industry operates for years to come. This is why it’s critical that the entire Web3 industry be involved in that conversation, and most critically, layer 1 blockchains and the builders on these platforms.I often hear from those new to Web3 or blockchain technology (including in my old TradFi world) that they “see the value of the blockchain technology, but that crypto is worthless.” Unfortunately, these comments are common by those who don’t realize that a blockchain needs native cryptocurrency to process transactions, incentivize validators and secure the network. Those less familiar with the technology, including many policymakers hostile to crypto, still haven’t heard of the job creation and economic growth potential of the companies building on top of blockchain infrastructure. Layer 1s, as the building blocks to the entire industry, must bring these founders and companies to the forefront to tell the story of the technology and its potential for real-world application. A technology-forward message is needed now, not a financial message.See also: The End of Crypto Twitter as We Know It? | OpinionAny new crypto legislation or Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulation must provide clarity for layer 1s and their native tokens while ensuring sufficient consumer protections. This means finally addressing the lack of clarity around the application of the Howey Test to these types of digital assets, including delineating whether they belong under Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or SEC jurisdiction. Should certain layer 1 native tokens ultimately be considered securities, any legislation or SEC rulemaking must provide safe harbor for those existing blockchain tokens in circulation and must arrange for an updated SEC registration regime that addresses the technological differences presented by digital assets. If the SEC will not begin a rulemaking process utilizing its existing authority, Congress must require the regulator to do so.Industry leading layer 1 blockchains must collaborate on policy engagement, delivering a uniform message that regulatory clarity is needed beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Only this will allow this important technology to continue to develop here in the United States, driving the technology companies of the future.",2022/12/27
23,"In 2021, Bitcoin and Ethereum accelerated further into the mainstream as the leading two blockchains on the planet, respectively. Both networks have deeply dedicated communities and developers working to protect and evolve the peer-to-peer technological innovations.Crypto advocates enjoy both systems for their unique characteristics and economic principles. Bitcoin has an extremely strict monetary policy aiming to be the most sound, decentralized money on the planet. Ethereum is an ever-evolving general purpose blockchain, which, one can debate, has sound money attributes but with a less-predictable token issuance schedule.Bill Ottman is the CEO and co-founder of Minds.com. This article is part of Crypto 2023.The majority of crypto users, investors and developers think multiple technologies can coexist. Some think bitcoin could be considered the hardest money known to humankind, while also acknowledging that Ethereum has creative capabilities in decentralized finance (DeFi) and notable smart contract composability.However, there’s a massive, exhausting debate between so-called “maximalists” on both sides who are hypercritical of the other network. Bitcoin maximalists dislike the term “crypto” itself because it conflates Bitcoin with scams and muddies the waters for new adopters. (Crypto derives from cryptography, the underlying security foundation that makes decentralized monetary networks possible.)The practice of calling anything other than Bitcoin a scam (or, less artfully, a s**tcoin) is sometimes labeled “toxic maximalism.” Online bitcoiners who defend the network against detractors and attack “imitators” are what MicroStrategy’s former CEO Michael Saylor called a “cybernetic immune system.” Historically, maximalism isn’t rare in tech – though it often results in embarrassment for any outspoken critics of, say, cars, planes, phones and the internet.Whatever the technological differences separate Bitcoin and Ethereum, it’s clear both networks also have a strong cultural and psychological divide. These different ecosystems and different aims have an impact on how the networks will progress.For instance, non-technical bitcoiners often say that “Bitcoin can’t be changed,” but let’s take a look at the specifics of both governance models and how exactly they are, in fact, different.Read more: End of the Monopoly: How Bitcoin Will Usher in a New Era of Governance in CryptoThis year, Ethereum transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake (consensus algorithms that determine how blocks of transactions are added to the chain). Last year, Bitcoin introduced Taproot, which reduced transaction fees, increased privacy and provided more wallet functionality. It is likely that the next major change will be BIP-119, which could provide additional benefits for the Lightning Network (Bitcoin’s scaling layer).Not long ago I had the opportunity to interview former Bitcoin Core developer Samuel Dobson to learn how the governance and development process actually works in Bitcoin. Typically, there aren’t nearly enough technical details discussed when communities criticize the other’s governance processes. It’s doubtful that most critics have ever even spoken to a core developer on either side.Apart from the handful of tools common to most blockchain governance processes (like Git merge requests and comments, live chat and mailing lists), Bitcoin and Ethereum do have their similarities.Both projects have relatively small groups of core developers (counted in the dozens). In the case of Bitcoin Core, only a few have commit access (aka maintainers, or those who can set updates to go live). Both projects utilize “rough consensus,” have long periods to scrutinize proposals (i.e., BIPs and EIPs, or Bitcoin or Ethereum Improvement Proposals) and make minor changes quite regularly. In Bitcoin these changes are called “standardness rules,” which are not consensus critical and can be changed relatively often.Both projects have also had rare bugs that have been dealt with in relatively centralized ways.For Bitcoin: On Aug. 15, 2010, a hacker created over 184 billion BTC due to a number overflow error. Bitcoin's total supply is meant to be capped at 21 million, so clearly this wasn’t acceptable. Ninety minutes later, Jeff Garzik spotted the issue. Satoshi can be found discussing a fix here and then implementing it. He said, “Once more than 50% of the node power is upgraded and the good chain overtakes the bad, the 0.3.10 nodes will make it hard for any bad transactions to get any confirmations.”For Ethereum: In 2016, shortly after The DAO launched and raised $150 million worth of ether (ETH) through a token sale, this first decentralized autonomous organization was hacked due to vulnerabilities in its code base. The Ethereum blockchain was eventually hard forked to restore the stolen funds. Not all parties agreed with this decision, resulting in the network splitting into two distinct blockchains, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.At the most basic level, Ethereum doesn't work like Bitcoin in that it doesn't have a single reference implementation. Each implementation has committers (e.g., Go-Ethereum, Nethermind, Besu, Erigon) but none of them is sufficient to change the entire protocol.Bitcoiners typically resist “consensus changes” that are changes that could create a fork and change the fundamental rules of the peer-to-peer (P2P) networking protocol. “Standardness rules,” however, are more flexible due to not being consensus critical. Bitcoin resists hard forks but accepts soft forks, which are not consensus changes, but are a strict subset of the previous rules. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin actually wrote about the issue.Ethereum has a specification (spec) that multiple clients are based off (the aforementioned Geth, OpenEthereum, Besu, Nethermind, Erigon), while Bitcoin Core is what all Bitcoin clients are based on (Bitcoin Core, Knots, Rust BTC, BTCD).Read more: 23 Blockchain Predictions for 2023At the social level, Ethereum has the Ethereum Foundation (EF), which was founded to help direct development of the network and was funded through the sale of ETH. Bitcoin Core is not a legal entity, it is software.In reality, both projects have numerous legal entities involved. While the Ethereum ecosystem is definitely more reliant on a smaller set of entities (EF, ConsenSys), there is no one entity that is the central coordinator. If EF or Consensys disappeared tomorrow, Ethereum development could continue as there are many independent teams developing core clients and other components of the ecosystem. Considering the number of players involved in the Merge, it’s a ridiculous criticism to say Vitalik is essential to its continued existence.Likewise, Satoshi Nakamoto actually disappeared. This left Bitcoin without a specific human to direct the network or target to take it down – a feature, not a bug. However, Bitcoin Core is still a loose organization, with owners of a Github account and reportedly a multisig wallet used for funding developer travel and accommodations at meetups. This wallet is intentionally kept on a need-to-know basis.Finally, generally speaking, Bitcoin favors soft forks and Ethereum favors hard forks.Too often the debate between Ethereum and Bitcoin about how to address protocol governance lacks perspectives from core developers. In reality, there’s a limited understanding of what’s actually happening on the ground for both networks.There have been a couple of useful interviews to come out of the “What Bitcoin Did” podcast hosted by Peter McCormack where a former Ethereum core team member, Lane Rettig, expressed concerns about the centralization of control in Ethereum (though he admittedly still supports the project). What was frustrating about the podcast was the lack of technical specifics from the Bitcoin Core perspective.In reaction to the interview, Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation said, “FWIW, most people in the Ethereum community I've spoken to disagree with a lot of Lane's criticism. It's a [three-hour] interview, so it's quite long to refute, but I wouldn't paint it as the consensus Ethereum view.”The ""Bankless"" podcast held a productive debate called “BTC vs ETH: Which is Better Money?” which covered some nuances of the process of both sides. But the conversation, like most conversations contrasting BTC and ETH, had more to do with economic policy than governance itself. The humans involved and tools used to govern matter greatly.The last podcast worth mentioning had Alex Gladstein debating Erik Voorhees on how the different blockchain technologies work and their varying levels of decentralization. The very concept of a “spectrum of decentralization” is positive – and shows how both Bitcoin and Ethereum have their own weaknesses and benefits. Voorhees argued both are overwhelmingly similar – though noted a clear difference in that Bitcoin’s economic policy sets it up as a long term sound money system.Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are fascinating networks whose differences help the world become more decentralized because they thrive in complementary areas. It’s also beneficial that certain people are interested solely in one or the other.Decentralization applies to both computing power and governance, and both are essential in determining the holistic level of decentralization.Samuel Dobson, the former Bitcoin core dev, expressed to me in our conversation that the difference is largely psychological with the participants. Bitcoin’s purpose is for maximum predictability and security, while Ethereum is more focused on constant innovation and composability.He said, “The Bitcoin community has a kind of in-built inertia. It's really hard to change things because it is really hard for a lot of people with diverse interests to agree on the changes. A lack of ‘leadership’ is a feature not a bug in this world.“Things moving slowly ensures that things are done safely with plenty of discussion, review and testing. We've seen first hand on certain forks of Bitcoin the impact of big changes being rushed through. In this way, the psychology of the Bitcoin community is a big part of its decentralization.Read more: Ethereum Developers Target March 2023 for Release of Staked Ether“Ethereum, on the other hand, places a lot more trust in Vitalik and the others to decide on the direction of the protocol. That's not to say they all follow blindly, of course – it is still an open-source project with review and discussion. But the endorsement of a relatively small group of individuals there allows much bigger changes to proceed much faster.“Their leadership is very centralized compared to Bitcoin's. I think that difference is more psychological than tangible: They're willing to sacrifice decentralization of development in favor of the ability to move quickly and ""experiment"" with lots of new changes.”In reaction, Ethereum’s Beiko noted Bitcoin has a few core devs with much more social capital and influence than the average contributor. Ethereum is similar in that regard – even if criticisms of Vitalik’s continued presense often feels like a strawman. By the numbers, Ethereum has many more people involved in its development.“In many ways, our development process is more decentralized,” Beiko said. No one person in Ethereum can “unilaterally force a change.”In the end, both network’s continued existence – despite the perceived threats they present to the established order – show what decentralization really means.",2022/12/27
24,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin held steady throughout the Christmas holiday weekend at about $16,900, while most other major cryptos were flat, although tinted more green than red.Insights: In this last week of 2022, First Mover Asia is revisiting a few of CoinDesk's best and most impactful stories from the past year. In a column last week, columnist David Z. Morris considered one of the upsides to the series of debacles that have deeply wounded the industry. Morris argues that investors' growing uncertainties about crypto's future will root out careless speculation and refocus attention on ""good deals and ideas.""A Quiet Holiday Weekend for Bitcoin, Other CryptosBy James RubinBitcoin held steady over the long Christmas weekend as investors largely ignored crypto and the macroeconomic uncertainties that have plagued the world in 2022.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $16,900, just about where it stood 24 hours earlier and where it finished Friday as markets wound down for the holiday. BTC is likely to continue in the same vein during the year's final days given business' historical, end-of-year slowdown.""Bitcoin looks like it might be finding a home between the $16,000 and $17,000 zone,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign-exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email.Ether was recently changing hands at slightly over $1,200, mirroring bitcoin's flat trading of the past three days. The second-largest crypto by market cap was up 0.5% from Sunday, same time. Other major cryptocurrencies were recently flat, although tinted more green than red. XRP, the token of open-source, public blockchain Ledger XRP, was among the biggest gainers, rising 5.4% to over 36 cents. ADA, the token of decentralized blockchain platform Cardano, and MATIC, the token of layer 2 platform Polygon, were both recently up more than 2%.U.S. equity markets were closed Monday in observance of the holiday weekend. They rose gently on Friday after the University of Michigan's latest consumer sentiment survey showed an uptick in optimism about the economy. Still, the S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, has dropped for three consecutive weeks.In crypto news, U.S. miners powered down over the weekend as a powerful winter storm swept across much of North America, sending temperatures to historic lows. The bitcoin mining hashrate, a measure of computing power on the blockchain, dropped about 100 exahash per second (EH/s), or 40%, to 156 EH/s, between Dec. 21 and Dec. 24, data from BTC.com shows. It returned to about 250 EH/s as of Sunday.Oanda's Moya was encouraged last week by the court approval of a $37.5 million bankruptcy loan for bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ). In the agreement, Core Scientific, one of the world's largest miners by computing power, reached a deal with some of its lenders to restructure its debt. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Wednesday.""The crypto miner shares are poised to rally which shows you that investors believe in the restructuring support agreement and are still willing to invest in some of the distressed parts of the crypto-verse,"" Moya wrote.There's Less Money in Crypto, and That's a Good ThingBy David Z. MorrisIf there’s one big thing that the mainstream coverage has missed about the various collapses in the crypto space over the past year, it’s this:The downfall of crypto had very little to do with crypto.David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist. This article is part of Crypto 2023.Cryptocurrency is the application of blockchain technology to build uncensorable, open-access and immutable global shared ledgers – usually monetary ledgers. But the headline crimes and failures of 2023 were almost uniformly attempts to use financial engineering to turn the future value of those systems into present-day U.S. dollars.Too often, the finance bros bet big, using the same kind of fragile, nested and interlocking leverage that led to the 2008 financial crisis. Other times they used outright fraud – and they did it off-chain, playing by no rules, with no transparency. They were mistaken for part of the cryptocurrency industry, but it would have been more accurate to think of them as hangers-on and freeloaders, redirecting genuine public interest in crypto to their various unsustainable games.As in much of contemporary finance, the finance bros were extractive rather than additive. They were not builders, but instead a swarm of hatchling vampire squid, little would-be Goldmans frantically shoving their underdeveloped blood-funnels into anything that smelled like money.The epic failures of these finance vampires, plus broader economic conditions, mean that 2023 in the crypto world will be a much different year than 2021 or 2022. Hedge fund gamblers and token-shilling hype men will be relegated to supporting roles, where they belong, as the shadowy super-coders who actually make crypto exist move back into the spotlight.See also: Money Crypto Versus Tech Crypto | OpinionBut 2023 will also be different from previous “BUIDL eras,” during which huge squads of nerds were often set free to pursue whatever seemed cool to them. There will certainly still be some of that, but smart leaders will be pushing their teams much more firmly toward clearer goals: Building accessible and reliable front ends, for use cases with real-world demand, then (hopefully) generating revenue from users. The broad public now has a vague idea of what crypto is (for better or worse). The task now is finding out how to sell it as a tool rather than a speculative investment.This will mean, among other things, less speculation on new tokens, particularly the tokens for new “layer 1” blockchains. In its place will be a relative increase in attention to services that leverage existing, trusted chains and ecosystems to build services with real demand that genuinely require the benefits of blockchains – cross-border fluidity, digital permanence, uncensorability and decentralized governance.Betting on the future (but not building it)This future, of course, assumes that the finance bros have been sufficiently embarrassed to feel some vague sense of humility and that their marks have wised up a bit. Personally, I don’t think that task is quite accomplished. Like unruly dogs beholden to their animal spirits, institutional traders and speculators may still need their noses rubbed into the mess they’ve made. So, let’s do that.Across many sectors of the economy, the 21st-century role of finance has become catastrophically perverted. Rather than risking capital to generate long-term profit by building productive industries, the capital game has become about timing bubbles and picking narratives that will trick naïve investors (retail or otherwise) into becoming bag carriers. Meanwhile you, the pumper, head off to the White Lotus with the cash.This isn’t a problem specific to crypto – especially not over the past three years. The litany of overbought, undercooked and sometimes just plain rotten companies rolls off the tongue: Clover Health (a 2020 Chamath special-purpose acquisition company  on the verge of delisting), Meta Platforms (rebranded around an app with no users), Nikola (an electric vehicle fraud that raised $3.2 billion), Tesla (once pumped, now dumped), Theranos ($700 million in venture capital, another fraud).The task now is finding out how to sell [crypto] as a tool, rather than a speculative investment.The villains of the 2022 crypto collapse were, with one exception, born and bred in this darkness. They saw little more in crypto than the prospect of good hunting. Su Zhu and Kyle Davies started Three Arrows Capital to trade foreign currencies before transitioning to crypto. Sam Bankman-Fried infamously came to crypto from technical trading at Jane Street. Steve Ehrlich of Voyager Digital formerly helped run E-Trade. Alex Mashinsky was steeped in Silicon Valley tech VC and its accompanying blather. The one exception is Terra creator Do Kwon, who did build a crypto network – but did it on the shifting sands of venture capital, leverage and concealed risk.Read the full story here1 p.m. HKT/SGT(5 a.m. UTC): Japan Housing Start (YoY/November)9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(1:30 p.m. UTC): U.S. Wholesale Inventories (November preliminary)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""On the Block"" on CoinDesk TV:Gin Chao: Still Bullish for CryptoIf you have been paying attention to crypto this year, then you’ll know that the industry has been on a roller-coaster ride, losing two-thirds of its value since hitting peaks in November 2021.

25,"Back during the DeFi Summer of 2020 – ages ago in Web3 time – the meme “degens” came about as a way to describe Web3 enthusiasts who were yield farming on systems with high annual percentage yield (APY) and high likelihood of failure. It’s a playful term that’s also revealing of the industry’s mercenary and self-interested side.In the first two years of the decade, driven by headlines, rising prices and FOMO, thousands of traders entered Web3 with the intention of making a quick buck. And despite a steep sell-off this year, crypto continued to go mainstream. There were Super Bowl ads. News of banks using decentralized finance (DeFi). And, yes, negative press about all the bankruptcies.Sadly, with the implosion of custodial systems like BlockFi and FTX a lot of people lost money. That is really bad for the people who were hurt and destructive for the space.Kevin Owocki is the chief executive and founder of SuperModular and co-founder of Gitcoin. This article is part of Crypto 2023.Since Satoshi solved the Byzantine Generals Problem in the Bitcoin white paper, there have been boom and bust cycles in crypto that, from an evolutionary perspective, are similar to natural systems. In times of abundance, thousands of new projects blossom. In times of scarcity, projects fail. The survivors will be the dominant species of the next boom (as visualized in this poster I made).Survival of the fittest is a simple yet powerful mechanism observable in the Web3 ecosystem – the fit best meet the preferences of markets. It might explain why degens, seemingly interested in short-term advancements rather than long-term success, hit a dead end. It turns out purely self-interested behaviors are maladaptive in Web3 (as they are many places in nature).Indeed, the industry that’s now known as Web3 has always had a side of it that is about more than greed and profit. Crypto is a tool for building collaborative organizations and sharing resources – the long-term trends that have always motivated participants.Recently, there’s been increasing awareness and focus on how blockchains, distributed systems with decentralized buy in, support public goods. Public goods are the stuff we all rely on (like open-source software or privacy research) but are hard to maintain and fund.See also: The Next Step in the Evolution of Web3: Regenerative Finance | Crypto 2023Another term for this is “regenerative economics,” the idea that money can be used to incentivise communities to solve systemic issues. Even when open-source projects fail, the exercise can benefit the rest – if everyone is moving along the same axis towards social betterment. Innovate, iterate, evolve, repeat.That’s why, even in the pits of crypto winter, 2023 is ripe to be the year of the regen.Degens came to Web3 seeking financial upside. Regens are those who are working or building in regenerative cryptoeconomics. They have a long-term view on how Web3 can be good for the world, but not just in the financial sense.Regens see how financial systems could be designed to act as channels for greater human flourishing in service of all of humanity’s needs. My friend Gregory Landua, co-founder of the Regen Network, argues people have eight essential needs that could be expressed as forms of capital. Beyond financial capital, there’s our social, material, living, intellectual, experiential, spiritual and cultural needs.See also: How DeFi 'Degens' Are Funding the Next Wave of Open Source Needs | OpinionWith programmable money, we can program our values into our money. Crypto has it within itself to create systems equally as extractive and fragile as the existing financial system. When a degen trades, he’s playing a zero-sum game – the tokens leave his wallet and enter the counterparty’s wallet and visa-versa. But Web3 can also build more positive sum protocols that expand resource capacity over time.There is a common thread linking many people in the regen ecosystem. They used to be degens! Lured by the promise of better economic circumstances for themselves and their family, they entered the ecosystem to make a profit.Over time, however, they grew enamored by the promises of collective action – often through the direct experience of contributing to or using a project. Their attitude and incentives shifted. That’s by design, built into the structure of crypto-economic systems. For instance, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) allow people with a shared mission to come together and pool resources – everyone involved is at least partially aligned in their values and commitments.See also: The One Word That Defines Ethereum's Goals | OpinionWhen you join such a community, you start learning to manage risk and ride the volatility. You think differently about capital allocation. But sometimes it takes more than that to get the bigger picture.Many regens are former degens who took this journey during the last cycle, in 2017. And that’s partially why I’m so optimistic about the future of regenerative systems. There are thousands and thousands of people who are newer to crypto, who came into Web3 in the last year or so, and they are likely on step two of the journey (i.e., down bad) now. They’ve made mistakes and learned from them, a base of knowledge that can serve for a more pragmatic approach to the next market cycle.The window of opportunity is here for newcomers to Web3 to move to step three – find community and discover crypto’s regenerative use cases. From there they will build the next cycle of projects, many that will be positive and impactful for the world.People sometimes say to me, “Hey Kevin, this talk of regenerative crypto-economics is great, but are there any examples of theory in action?”Regen is not just talk. It is happening! In fact, Alejandra Borda and I wrote an entire book detailing 100 different examples of projects where people are using crypto to regenerate the world.To namedrop a few: Proof of Humanity, Celo, Kolectivo and Gitcoin (the crypto-based crowdfunding protocol I built) are all doing worthy things.In this down cycle we have an opportunity to filter the noise from the signal and rediscover our purpose. Through decentralization and peer-to-peer technology we can build a more fair, just and less extractive financial system. We can bring more democratic, more organic financial tools to the masses.As individuals, we can find community, join a DAO and BUIDL on the projects that could serve as the foundation of the next era of Web3. It’s the year to build projects that are democratic, prosocial and net-positive for the world.To regain legitimacy, the Web3 ecosystem must find ways to rotate capital, attention and talent away from the projects that have the best Ponzi-nomics and towards the projects that are going to have the most durable positive impact. We want this not because we want crypto to look good for the world, but because we want crypto to be good for the world.Many of today's most mainstream crypto projects have positive externalities. For example, OpenSea, the largest non-fungible token (NFT) exchange, has allowed thousands of artists to monetize their work and generate new forms of income that are less extractive than their Web2 counterparts.Lens Protocol, a Web3 social media platform that’s generating increasing buzz in crypto amid changes at Twitter, are enabling people to own their own data and to take their social media presence from site to site. Web3 social media has the potential to disrupt tech giants. (Disclosure: I am a Lens Protocol angel investor.)Proof Of Humanity, a registry of 18,000 Sybil attack-resistant identities, is using UBI tokens to pay people a stipend. Gitcoin is a crowdfunding platform that has delivered $72 million worth of funding to public goods and recently released a suite of protocols that allows others to crowdfund for their communities. Kolektivo is a suite of protocols that allow local communities to launch, finance and govern their own regenerative economies.See also: Who Is Building Ethereum's Public Goods? | OpinonWeb3 carbon credit systems such as KlimaDAO and Toucan Protocol allow for better, faster and cheaper carbon credit trading.

26,"Crypto miners across the U.S. powered down over the weekend as a powerful storm swept across North America.The bitcoin mining hashrate, a measure of computing power on the blockchain, dropped about 100 exahash per second (EH/s), or 40%, to 156 EH/s, between Dec. 21 and Dec. 24, data from BTC.com shows. It returned to about 250 EH/s as of Sunday.The practice, known as curtailment, is touted as a way for miners to help electricity grids. The miners' steady demand ensures power producers are bringing in revenue to offset costs, but they can power off when demand from other sources is high, such as during winter storms.The U.S. and Canada have been hit by an Arctic storm that sent temperatures as low as -50°F (-45°C) in the western U.S. state of Montana, according to the BBC, and covered western New York state with as much as 43 inches of snow. At least 37 people died as result of the storm, CNN reported.Foundry USA, the biggest mining pool in the U.S., lost more than half of its hashrate on Dec. 23 – the biggest loss of any major pool – according to statistics from information platform Mining Pool Stats. Foundry is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group.Some of the U.S.’ biggest miners also curtailed operations. These included Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Core Scientific (CORZ), which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last Wednesday. In Texas, 99% of industrial-scale bitcoin mining load was turned off at 6 a.m. on Saturday, Lee Bratcher, founder and president of industry group Texas Blockchain Council, said in a LinkedIn post.Dennis Porter, who advocates for the industry through the nonprofit Satoshi Action Fund, said the miners’ curtailment is proof that they are supporting the electric grid.Denis Rusinovich, a Europe-based miner, tweeted that the big drop in computing power is “another confirmation that bitcoin's geographical diversification is vital.”",2022/12/26

I think the fraud speaks for itself. The embezzlement (or whatever it was) at FTX hurt real people. Rubbing salt in the wound: I got to ask FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried some questions, months before his exchange collapsed, on a CoinDesk TV program, but I failed to touch on anything hard-hitting. We talked about the Super Bowl mostly.Watch: New FTX Boss Condemns Management of the Crypto Exchange During Sam Bankman-Fried's TenureMy brain is raising at least two pitchforks for the folks at crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). It’s one thing to be a little annoyed with highly leveraged hedge funds (like 3AC) doing risky things in general; it’s another to be annoyed at the associated flexing (i.e., “showing off”) that took place on social media and elsewhere as highly leveraged hedge funds raked in the cash the last few years.But it was revealed during liquidation proceedings that 3AC co-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu paid for a $50 million superyacht with company funds all while flexing that “100K ETH is dust.” Calling 100,000 ether “dust” was calling $400 million “not a lot of money.” 3AC collapsed. Also, the superyacht was named: “Much Wow.”Yeah, I know.Much cringe.I think that Bitcoin maximalism, the idea that bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that matters, is fine. Many smart people that I like and respect disagree with me because of the toxic culture it nurtures, but our disagreement isn’t what annoyed me in 2022. What annoyed me is the absolutist language used by maximalism’s adherents. If you don’t understand that you still could be wrong about Bitcoin, then you’re just role-playing as a savior.Also Bitcoin doesn’t have to be “alive”, as former MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor put it on Twitter. Those who tweet that “Bitcoin is [some random adjective]” are just saying stuff for the sake of saying it. It doesn’t make any sense or mean anything at all. And who cares if ether is a security or not? My take is that Bitcoin maximalism would probably be better served if it lived by the adage: “Bitcoin is. And that is enough.”Two weeks ago I complained about Goldman Sachs (GS) co-opting “blockchain” as a buzzword and using it to sell the merits for private blockchain bond issuance. So I’m mad at GS (nothing new here) for selling snake oil.But I’m also mad at effectively centralized chains, such as Binance Smart Chain, for selling snake oil by acting as if they are broadly decentralized. And at the “Ethereum is ultra-sound money” crowd. And at Decentraland users who are angry at journalists for reporting user numbers. And at bitcoiners overstating the impact of Taro as a monumental development when nothing has been delivered to market yet.I’m not mad because I think any of these people are wrong. Yes, maybe one day Decentraland will have more than 810 daily active users and maybe one day Taro will bring stablecoins to the masses via Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. But for now, they aren’t. It’s fine to be excited, but I believe that if we want crypto to be taken seriously at all (which I do), then we’d be better served if we stopped overselling how healthy and vibrant the ecosystem is today.I tweeted earlier this year that this was the “year for privacy.” I don’t think I was correct thematically, but I do want to give more airtime to the importance of privacy as we close out the year.Privacy is a human right and it should be normalized. So it’s probably unsurprising that privacy deniers also irked me in 2022. We don’t have to look far to see the most recent infringement that had a crypto wrapping on it given U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s recently proposed Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, which is less focused on stopping money laundering than it is on infringing on privacy.The shortest version of why I think privacy is important goes like this: You don’t need privacy until the exact moment that you do. And if your retort is that it is only criminals who need privacy, do remember that you are not a criminal until the moment that you are.So to you, privacy deniers, fraudsters and the like, let’s leave all the stuff I don’t like in 2022.",2022/12/25

29,"Bitcoin mining equipment and hosting provider Blockware Solutions was accused by a customer in a lawsuit of breach of contract, negligence, deceptive trade practices and fraud.The case, filed in U.S. federal court in the Northern District of Illinois on Dec. 17, centers around an allegation that Blockware sold Faes & Co. 50 mining rigs for $525,000. But, Faes said in the lawsuit, “Blockware did not actually own or operate a facility to host the miners and was not capable of doing so reliably.” Also, the facilities owned by third parties that Blockware could tap didn’t have reliable power, resulting in subpar service, according to the suit.“As a result, Faes’ miners under Blockware’s management and control have experienced prolonged downtime and inoperability due to lack of power, resulting in significant loss of revenue,” Faes argued. Faes said it has suffered at least $250,000 of damages.London-based Faes said it ordered the machines to be delivered and hosted in Blockware’s own facilities in January, when bitcoin mining was highly profitable amid a bull market. The rigs only came online in April, Faes said. The machines were running with 70% uptime on average as of October, as opposed to the advertised 100%, Faes said.Operational issues, according to Faes, started as soon as the machines were online, which eventually become “nonoperational” in October. Prior to the machines going offline, Blockware was claiming 100% uptime on a 90-day status page, including for a facility in Pennsylvania, where Faes’ rigs were located, often not working, according to the lawsuit.“We disagree with all statements and claims” in the lawsuit, Blockware CEO Mason Japp told CoinDesk. “We are confident it will be tossed out from the court, we have honestly served this industry for over 5.5 years and this has been [the] first filed lawsuit against us.”Blockware is at least the second retail-facing mining company to be accused of operational problems this year. In July, both the CEO and the chief financial officer of Compass Mining resigned following a series of “setbacks and disappointments,” such as delays in machine deployment deploying machines and several thousand rigs being stranded in Russia following sanctions on its hosting partner in that country.Read more: After Countless Bungles, Compass Mining Tries to Change CourseMeanwhile, major industrial-scale miners such as Compute North and Core Scientific have found themselves in bankruptcy proceedings, squeezed between high energy prices and low bitcoin prices.",2022/12/23

The tendency to look for patterns where there are none is helpful in the wild: It’s better to see illusory predators than to miss the ones that are out to kill you. When it comes to thinking clearly, however, it has its drawbacks.Association fallacies are everywhere. From a red herring in a debate to the guilt-by-association that smears public figures, association fallacies skew your strongest-held opinions. At best, it’s why you dislike a rival quarterback. But more seriously it’s the nightmare fuel that allows otherwise reasonable people to resist social, political and technological progress.Pat Duffy is the co-founder of The Giving Block. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023.Crypto has been more victimized by association fallacies in recent history than any other technology – scandals including Mt. Gox, Bitconnect and now Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX taint a whole industry, whatever its part in the catastrophe. Take the instinct to see nefarious patterns where they don’t exist and combine it with default bias (preferring the devil you know to the devil you don’t) and you begin to see why the adoption curve for cryptocurrency is so fragile.Read more: David Z. Morris - There's Less Money in Crypto, and That's a Good ThingIn 2021, crypto was at an all-time high and it finally felt like people were starting to see crypto as a force for good. Now, one bad actor is on the verge of undoing more than a decade of Web3 progress. The actions of one have overshadowed the incredible impact that crypto has had on society, and the number of lives that it has saved since its inception.Crypto has saved people suffering from the fiat crisis in Lebanon, Venezuela and China – providing a way for the average person to buy food, water and medical supplies necessary to survive. Crypto is sparking crucial conversations around banking the unbanked and empowering women in places such as Afghanistan to control their own financial accounts without male guardians.In the charitable sector, crypto is one of the fastest-growing donation methods, with the most generous donors of any investment community. Blockchain-based decentralized IDs are saving refugees from losing their life savings or being separated from their families. Crypto is leading the way on privacy and transparency simultaneously, shielding human rights advocates from retribution by tyrannical regimes, while creating a fully transparent Bitcoin blockchain that has lived for more than a decade without a single record being altered.FTX was bad. But crypto is one of the greatest forces for good on the planet. If we allow the narrative to continue on this path, the association fallacy will snowball, systematically erasing any memory of more than a decade’s worth of positive crypto impact. So, what can we do about it?We can start by abandoning this strategy of sticking our heads in the sand and waiting for this to blow over. Talk to anyone in crypto right now and they’re in a holding pattern. Everyone’s worried about putting their foot in their mouth, so the only stories people see are negative stories about former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and FTX. This might be a good strategy for not putting our feet in our mouths, but it’s not doing anything about the feet that are kicking us while we’re down. If you’re not speaking up right now you’re a part of the problem.Continue showcasing all of the good that crypto is doing around the world. Typically, the holiday season is full of heartfelt stories about the impact of crypto. Crypto is still saving lives every single day, but those stories aren’t being told the same way they were prior to FTX’s collapse. If the crypto community can come together to tell these stories they are less likely to be forgotten.It’s one thing to discuss the positive impact that crypto has made on the world, it’s another to put your money where your mouth is and use your crypto for good. Though crypto philanthropy is such a small part of the crypto story, its impact has been felt globally. You don’t have to donate much, but every single donation shows the world that crypto can make real, tangible changes to this world.From our side, at The Giving Block we’re going well beyond that, starting “The Crypto is Good Project,” which will focus on compiling data, profiles and reports on the ways in which crypto is a force for good. If you’re in crypto, now is the time to take a little time and build a use case that matters.If the crypto community seizes this moment to shed light on the bright side of crypto, we’ll put FTX behind us and go back to changing the world. If we don’t, people will continue to look at us and see SBF. That’s our choice right now. I’m hoping more people make the right one.",2022/12/23
31,"Crypto price movement was relatively mild this week.Despite the soap opera surrounding Sam Bankman-Fried’s arrest, extradition and incredible shrinking $250 million bond, crypto assets appear to be ignoring the noise and trading on the basis of fundamentals, sentiment and basic supply and demand.This is welcome news for markets in that focus can now shift to factors that are more connected to valuations. One factor that stands out is the decline in trading volume, understandable given the time of year. Crypto traders can be forgiven for a break after an exhausting and painful year.The weekly chart for bitcoin (BTC) shows an approximate 50% decline in trading volume on Binance, along with a 17% decline in trading volume for ether.Bitcoin’s seven-day performance versus the U.S. dollar was middle of the pack (ninth) this week relative to the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.By contrast, BTC finished third in the prior week. Its absolute performance was stronger, however, gaining 1.4% versus a 0.9% decline last week.Ether’s 4.7% increase was a mirror opposite of last week’s 4.6% decline. ETH landed third on the performance list. BNB led the way with a 6.4% gain.There was a much narrower dispersion of performance this week, with winners and losers ranging from 6.4% to -3.1%, compared to 30.6% to -15.4% the week prior.Bitcoin and ether remain range-boundOur thoughts on bitcoin’s chart are relatively unchanged from our thoughts a week ago.Momentum is fairly stagnant, with BTC's Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading remaining in fairly neutral territory.Past trading activity shows significant price agreement between $16,500 and $17,000.

32,"It has been more than a decade since Satoshi introduced the world to the peer-to-peer electronic cash system called Bitcoin, and yet the regulatory landscape for crypto-assets remains a dark forest. After one of the most eventful years in crypto to date, what can we expect from the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (crypto’s primary U.S. market regulators) in 2023?The SEC nearly doubled the size of its crypto-asset enforcement team in early 2022 and will likely continue to regulate by enforcement in 2023.Michael Selig is counsel at Willkie Farr & Gallagher. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023.SEC Chair Gary Gensler believes that the “vast majority” of crypto assets are securities. He said “probably only a few” may not be securities. While he might “think CryptoKitties is not a security,” the SEC is also reportedly investigating non-fungible tokens.The SEC regards many crypto assets as a type of security called an “investment contract.” In SEC v. W.J. Howey & Co., the U.S. Supreme Court defined an investment contract as a contract, transaction or scheme whereby an investor invests money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.During his prior tenure as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Gensler oversaw the implementation of new swap market regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. As SEC chair his approach to regulating crypto assets resembles his CFTC approach to regulating swaps. The Gensler-era CFTC disregarded industry opposition and leveraged the existing futures regulatory framework to hurriedly adopt a swaps regulatory framework that did not work for much of the market.Read more: Adam Miller - 2023: The Year DAOs Follow the Law?In the case of crypto assets, Gensler has “asked the SEC staff to work directly with entrepreneurs to get their tokens registered and regulated, where appropriate, as securities.” However, it appears unlikely that rules specifically tailored to crypto assets will be proposed during 2023. Gensler’s view is that most crypto assets are securities and therefore most crypto-asset issuers and intermediaries are subject to the same laws and regulations as other securities issuers and intermediaries. Gensler may face pushback from the Republican-controlled House Financial Services Committee in 2023, but is not likely to reverse course.The regulatory narrative will continue to be shaped by the SEC’s enforcement actions. Since 2017 the SEC has brought dozens of actions for failing to register offers and sales of crypto assets as securities. These actions have mostly involved “utility tokens” sold in the days of initial coin offerings. The legal theory advanced by the defendants in many of these cases has been that the crypto assets were not part of an investment contract because the assets had consumptive use and therefore purchasers should not have reasonably expected profits. But lower courts have thus far rejected this argument, concluding that a crypto asset may be sold as part of an investment contract even if it has consumptive use.More recently, crypto projects have shifted their focus to decentralization and community ownership. It is common for projects to issue crypto assets as a means of distributing governance and control over a network, protocol or organization to a broad and dispersed community. The legal theory likely to be advanced by these projects under the Howey Test is that such crypto assets are not securities because there is no “other” upon which holders of the crypto asset rely to earn profits.As certain of the SEC’s more longstanding lawsuits against crypto-asset issuers conclude next year, the SEC may announce novel enforcement actions involving crypto assets associated with more decentralized crypto networks, protocols and organizations. The CFTC brought its first enforcement action against a decentralized autonomous organization this year and it may not be long before the SEC follows suit.Gensler has emphasized that crypto market intermediaries (“whether they call themselves centralized or decentralized”) must register with the SEC. This signals that the agency may prioritize actions against intermediaries in 2023. These actions could test the theory that a crypto asset initially offered or sold as part of an investment contract remains an investment contract even when it is traded in secondary markets. In this regard, SEC v. Wahi, where the SEC alleges a crypto-asset exchange (Coinbase) employee engaged in insider trading, is a case to watch.The CFTC has limited authority over crypto assets. It has exclusive jurisdiction over commodity derivatives, but only holds anti-manipulation and anti-fraud jurisdiction over commodity spot transactions. Its jurisdiction over crypto assets is based upon its position that bitcoin, ether, tether and other crypto assets are commodities.CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam has requested “clear authority to impose [the CFTC’s] traditional regulatory regime over the digital asset commodity market.” Earlier this year, bipartisan legislators in the U.S. Congress introduced competing bills that would each establish a crypto market intermediary registration regime overseen by the CFTC. These bills are likely to be reintroduced in 2023. After recent crypto market events, a comprehensive crypto bill that expands the CFTC’s jurisdiction may see broad support. However, neither bill would establish a bright line between SEC and CFTC jurisdiction over crypto assets. Gensler believes that most crypto assets are securities and Behnam has not challenged this view. In fact, he has advocated for “shared responsibility” between the agencies. Regardless of what happens on Capitol Hill in 2023, the CFTC is unlikely to win jurisdiction over all crypto assets.The CFTC has been active in regulating by enforcement. More than 20% of the agency’s enforcement actions in 2022 involved crypto assets, and it is not likely to let up in 2023. Although the agency does not comprehensively regulate crypto-asset spot markets, the CFTC has recently begun to seek crypto-asset trading bans against defendants. This signals that the agency regards itself as the cop on the beat for non-security crypto asset markets. The CFTC’s lawsuit against the Ooki DAO made headlines this year because it raised novel legal questions. One question: Are decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) “unincorporated associations” and can they be served with notice of the lawsuit through an online chatbot and forum? This is a case to continue to watch in 2023.* * *The crypto-asset regulatory landscape will likely remain a dark forest in 2023. SEC Chair Gensler believes the majority of crypto assets are securities but is not in favor of new crypto market rules or guidance. On the other hand, CFTC Chair Behnam seeks additional CFTC authority over crypto assets but the agency is currently limited in its ability to issue rules or guidance for these markets. While crypto projects continue to push the boundaries of decentralization and community governance, the SEC and CFTC will likely push the boundaries of their existing authorities through novel enforcement actions. With neither agency poised to issue new crypto rules, 2023 will be the year of regulation versus decentralization.",2022/12/23
33,"If Elon Musk’s controversial leadership of Twitter sends the platform into the slow death spiral many are predicting, what happens to Crypto Twitter?Insider Intelligence this week predicted Twitter will lose 30 million users over the next two years. That’s about 10% of the active user base, but given that many of those expected to remain are likely to be relatively inactive or are bots, the impact on real, human engagement could be significant. It could also breed a kind of reverse network effect, as the smaller community makes the site less attractive, leading to more departures in a negative feedback loop.It is also reasonable to assume that Crypto Twitter, the argumentative “CT” community of crypto enthusiasts, critics, meme propagators, NFT creators, coin-pumpers and related trolls, will also see exits.You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.More to the point: What will the community look like, in terms of its diversity of ideas, after those departures? Given the prominent (if highly imperfect) role that Twitter has played as a forum in which industry stakeholders discuss issues and hash out differences, it’s an extremely relevant matter for the future of crypto.Generally speaking, the kinds of people considering leaving Twitter – some folks are calling for a mass “Twixit” event – are probably different in their political and ideological persuasions from those adamant on staying.Twixit “leavers” likely skew toward a more liberal political bent. Many have expressed discomfort with a reported increase in anti-semitic and racist slurs as Musk has adjusted the moderation policies. Others are angered by the recent suspension of journalists’ accounts. Already half of Twitter’s advertisers reportedly abandoned the platform in the month after Musk took over out of concern about negative associations with their brand. Other corporate accounts are worried that the new CEO’s mass layoffs are leaving the site vulnerable to security breaches.Those “remainers” enthusiastic about the new Twitter and so committed to stay are likely to be more supportive of Musk’s stated mission as “a free speech absolutist” to end “shadowbanning” and remove supposed political bias from content moderation. Many describe themselves as “anti-woke,” expressing concern about culturally imposed constraints on speech that liberals consider offensive. They tend to align with Silicon Valley tech leaders in their ongoing battle with the mainstream press and believe that “citizen journalism” on Twitter provides a more reliable source of information than “biased” news organizations. Their ranks include a large number of libertarian-leaning people who staunchly defend property rights and are suspicious of government intervention and surveillance.That kind of division seems destined to play out in Crypto Twitter because the population of people interested in this technology draws from a similar spectrum of personalities as the general population. (Contrary to mainstream critics’ depictions of a monolithic community of lawless, money-worshiping “crypto bros,” the humans in this field encompass a diverse array of backgrounds and political leanings.)This matters because of the outsized role Twitter has played in crypto discourse. As a decentralized community with no central decision-makers, there needs to be public fora for stakeholders in the industry to hash out ideas and differences. For detailed changes to code, that debate often happens in developer chat rooms, but when it comes to arguments over big, contentious issues, Twitter has played a vital role.Twitter’s place in crypto was cemented during the Block Size War of 2016-2017, climaxing with the implementation of a “user-activated soft fork” in the Bitcoin code, which effectively prevented miners from implementing a proposal from certain businesses to increase the block capacity of the blockchain. On Twitter, supporters of the “small blocks” status quo aggressively propagated the hashtag “#UASF” to successfully stir support for it.If that was the high point, many, myself included, argue that the crypto experience on Twitter has deteriorated significantly since then.The clearest mark of that is the surge in token-shilling bots that fill up replies to tweets and effectively discourage engagement. Musk’s pre-acquisition criticisms of Twitter’s handling of bot accounts and the notion that his move to charge users for identifying check marks could discourage their proliferation offered some initial hope for potential change. But the token bots have kept coming. Meanwhile, at least from this observer’s perch, two other negative experiences of Crypto Twitter appear to have intensified: the toxicity of interactions and the discouragement of nuance and careful readings.Creating a more homogenous, increasingly fortified pool of ideologues, whether of the left or the right, could make things even more unbearable for anyone expressing a view that challenges  that majority. There’s a piling-on effect that happens when one side is disproportionately represented, as encouragement from like-minded users sparks a dopamine release feedback loop to drive abusive behavior. Eventually, when the dissenting minority is driven away, perhaps the toxicity will die down. But then what are you left with? Groupthink.None of this is in crypto’s interest. It’s axiomatic that permissionless, open-source environments thrive on a plurality of ideas from which the “wisdom of the crowd” can be drawn. Indeed, diversity of thought – which, interestingly, is an argument against “wokeness” – is the reason for the one relatively consistent mindset among crypto people of otherwise varying political persuasions: a resistance to centralized authority over the design of this technology.Now, I’m not especially worried that if Crypto Twitter shrinks to the point where it ceases to be a useful, open, multi-viewpoint forum, the crypto community will lose its capacity to properly debate and develop ideas. The era of Web3 may shift us out of centralized social media altogether and into wallet-based, on-chain networks of conversation that, while siloed for specific projects, create links of interoperable exchange across communities in which ideas can intersect, clash and synthesize into new concepts.As my colleague Daniel Kuhn opined, Musk is indirectly offering a clear argument for a decentralized Web3 internet. The contradictions and flip-flops seen in his erratic attempts to define and manage free speech on Twitter are not necessarily a problem unique to him; they are the direct outcome of centralized control, no matter who is in charge. Free speech cannot be “guaranteed” by a controlling private individual with his own natural, human whims and self interests.The real good news is that we’re already seeing the failings of Musk’s attempts to fix Twitter spurring interest in a new, crypto-friendly alternative: for instance, Nostr, the open-relay protocol that’s seeking to build a censorship-resistant social network, now with former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s financial support. Meanwhile, Mastodon is gaining support.It was fun while it lasted. But Crypto Twitter’s demise mightn’t be a bad thing.",2022/12/23
34,"Craig Wright has been given permission to appeal a Norwegian court ruling concerning his claim to be Satoshi Nakomoto, founder of Bitcoin, CoinDesk has been told.In October, Judge Helen Engebrigtsen of the Oslo District Court ruled that Magnus Granath (who goes by the Twitter handle Hodlonaut) had been entitled to post tweets in 2019 calling Wright a “fraud” and a “scammer” for saying he was the true founder of Bitcoin.Wright’s right to protest that ruling has now been upheld by the Norwegian Court of Appeal, lawyers involved in the case have told CoinDesk, offering yet another twist in an already tangled series of legal cases.“For Dr. Wright, this decision means that the Court of Appeals will hear his case and render its own independent decision,” Wright’s attorney, Halvor Manshaus, told CoinDesk in a statement.“The case involves other non-economic interest, aside from just the monetary claims, and may also raise important legal principles for the court to address,” Manshaus, a partner at Oslo practice Schjødt, added. The lawyer cited such issues as “defamation, protection of the personal sphere and harassment.”Granath’s lawyers, meanwhile, attempted to play down the significance of the decision in a jurisdiction where there is a presumption that any case can be heard twice.“There is nothing dramatic or unusual about the decision” by the appeals court, said Ørjan Salvesen Haukaas, a partner at DLA Piper, in an email.Manshaus told CoinDesk back in October of Wright’s intention to appeal, saying that “anonymous online bullying” could have a “chilling effect” on public discourse. Granath (Hodlonaut) hoped to use the Norwegian case to forestall an unfavorable ruling in the U.K., where defamation laws are stricter.In the U.K., Wright scored a partial legal victory on Wednesday when he was awarded 900,000 pounds (US$1.1 million) in costs in relation to a separate claim made by podcaster Peter McCormack. Wright was previously awarded only nominal damages by U.K. Judge Martin Chamberlain, who said Wright had “put forward deliberately false evidence.”In her judgment, Engebrigtsen said Granath had “sufficient factual grounds” for his tweets, after witnesses at the trial demonstrated discrepancies in the documents Wright used to prove his claims, such as typefaces that weren’t around in 2008.In tweets sent on Wednesday, Wright appeared to signal he was giving up on legal attempts to prove he invented Bitcoin.Read more: The Bullied Takes the Bully to Court",2022/12/23

Is it possible 2023 is the year energy FUD around Bitcoin finally dies?Kent Halliburton is the president and chief operating officer of Sazmining. This article is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023.So-called “green bitcoiners” made themselves heard over the past 12 months, and they’ve brought novel ideas to the fore. Troy Cross, professor of philosophy at Reed College in Oregon and fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, has broached several ideas on bitcoin (BTC) mining and energy with which bitcoiners are still wrestling.Together with Yale-NUS professor of philosophy Andrew Bailey, Cross has been arguing that bitcoiners have a sort of moral duty to uphold related to bitcoin and the environment. They say their ideas is a “way to invest in bitcoin without contributing, even slightly, to unsustainable bitcoin mining.” (Their white paper came out in late 2021, but gained traction in 2022.)Meanwhile, Cleantech investor Daniel Batten put together groundbreaking research into bitcoin mining, and may have found a way to put a significant dent in humanity's methane problem. Batten has explained through careful calculations how and why bitcoin mining is the only available technology that can mitigate humanity’s methane emissions at scale.Finally, in 2022 Jason Maier crowdfunded and wrote his book, “A Progressive’s Case for Bitcoin.” He makes the case that Bitcoin is, contrary to critics, a net positive for the environment. In 2022, several bitcoin-focused companies launched with a mandate of proving the viability that the Bitcoin blockchain could contribute to fighting climate change through competition and free markets. Synota, for instance, was founded this year and raised a $3 million seed round to pursue its mission.The company’s platform allows energy companies and their customers to trade energy and money more frequently and with less friction than traditional payment rails allow. It’s a use that may “promote global energy abundance by integrating Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and energy,” they write.Read more: The More Energy Bitcoin Uses, the BetterDid you hear of the company that converts landfill waste into BTC? Vespene launched this year, and uses methane emissions from landfill as fuel to power bitcoin miners, putting into practice what Batten theorized. In August, it closed a $4.3 million funding round to continue its pioneering project into carbon-negative mining.Finally, Jack Dorsey’s digital payments company, Block, and Alyse Killeen’s VC firm, Stillmark, recently invested in a company that builds out renewable bitcoin mining sites in parts of Africa that have excess power. Still at the seed stage, Gridless, in 2023, plans to launch a hydro mining site in Malawi and a solar-powered mining site in West Africa.Admittedly, critics of the Bitcoin network’s energy consumption and environmental impact have made a meaningful dent on adoption.

36,"As cults of personality and centralized platforms lose their sheen, we must return to the fundamentals that drove the crypto industry at its inception: decentralization, self-custody and economic empowerment for all. In a phrase: decentralized finance (DeFi).DeFi brings a lot of diversity to our economy, but one specific sector of DeFi that will continue to see prolonged, exponential growth in 2023 is the derivatives market, and even more specifically options trading. The reasons for crypto options' high probability of growth in the new year can be pinned to massive yet-unrealized potential for trading in both retail and institutional capacities. If we learn to read the markets, make smart use of the data at our disposal and overcome a few speed bumps along the way, options will certainly drive the next era of DeFi to higher highs than ever before.Greg Magadini is director of derivatives at Amberdata.

This shows how popular options are. And for good reason – options are, essentially, insurance policies that allow the ability for investors to tailor trades and risk tolerance, which is why they’ve remained a popular investment strategy during the bear market.Options give traders, well, options. Think about insuring your home – certainly every homeowner will carry fire insurance to help protect their investment. This behavior is what allows you to tailor or insure the risks that you don't want to take, and basically trade that risk away to someone else. With options you're able to express investment views that incorporate new elements; instead of just saying “price go up” or ”price go down,” you can say “price go up by this date,” or “in this timeframe” or “with this velocity.”And while the crypto options market continues to grow extremely fast, there is still plenty of room for growth. If we consider the market cap of bitcoin versus the outstanding notional open interest of crypto options, it's about 6%. Whereas in traditional finance, that number is 200%. Let’s call it an opportunity to see a 30 to 35 times increase just to match the same sort of relative levels as traditional finance.So, what’s holding the options market back from achieving this growth in the here and now?Read more: The Year Crypto Yields Blew Up | OpinionOn the surface, there are a lot of similarities between crypto options and traditional finance (TradFi) options. But the main difference is that we’re still learning how external events affect the crypto market, while in TradFi people know how to identify big mover events. TradFi investors have access to earning reports or substantial company news covered by the media. These events inform traders what the smartest trades will be, as long as they pay close attention. But crypto is the exact opposite.In crypto, we don't necessarily know what it looks like when an encryption algorithm breaks. When someone tweeted that Vitalik Buterin had died, ether (ETH) temporarily “crashed” on the “news” before swinging right back. With such fast-moving tech, there are numerous events and forks that are necessary and common, and yet people don't know how they will affect the market. Even the Ethereum Merge in September – a hugely anticipated event that had people expecting extreme volatility – came and went and the prices remained remarkably stable.See also: 2023: The Year Blockchain Becomes a Sustainability Solution | OpinionThe lesson? We don't know how to value the true potential of crypto yet, and we know even less about how it should move based on volatility events. But all is not lost. Not only do trading strategies like options provide us with ways to mitigate losses and customize risk levels, but the way our underlying blockchains are designed provides us with access to an enormous amount of consistently-generated, granular data such as spot data, which provides a true source of price and volatility. Analyzing this data will teach us to recognize trends and movement events. And the best part is the more use DeFi gets, the more data we have at our disposal and the more we learn. DeFi only gets stronger as it grows.DeFi options will continue to see exponential growth due to their dynamic nature, massive investment prospects and, soon, ease of access and use. There are currently many competing models, and certainly many questions still loom large, especially with regard to regulation. Yet, as things mature we can expect to see the barriers fall. More investors will see DeFi for the next evolution in our economy that it truly is. Options trading will help drive this adoption, because as an investment strategy it offers immense utility to institutions and retail traders alike.",2022/12/23

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has been released on bail after appearing in U.S. federal court in New York on Thursday. Bankman-Fried was told he can live with his parents on $250 million bail secured in part by their Palo Alto, California, house. His release also includes a long list of requirements for him to remain free while he faces charges. He's not allowed to make financial transactions of more than $1,000, can't open new lines of credit, can't leave the house except to exercise and must go through substance abuse and mental health treatment, according to the agreement.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is increasing its scrutiny of audits of cryptocurrency companies in an effort to warn investors who may feel assured by audits such as proof-of-reserve reports. “Investors should not place too much confidence in the mere fact a company says it’s got a proof-of-reserves from an audit firm,” said Paul Munter, the SEC’s acting chief accountant. Having such a report “is not enough information for an investor to assess whether the company has sufficient assets to cover its liabilities,” he added.Tron founder Justin Sun was a top client of crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments. A private financial document reviewed by CoinDesk shows that Sun, one of the richest figures in crypto, was responsible for the vast majority of a key Valkyrie division’s assets under management. He had more than $580 million of bitcoin stashed with the asset manager at one point in August. This amounted to over 90% of money at Valkyrie’s largest division, Valkyrie Digital Assets LLC.",2022/12/23
38,"Cryptocurrency exchange OKX published a second proof-of-reserves (PoR) report, adding features that allow users to verify that the second-largest platform by trading volume has sufficient assets to handle customer withdrawals.The report, released Thursday, shows that as of Tuesday, 12:00 UTC, OKX's wallets held 113,754 bitcoin (US$1.87 billion) against a user balance of 112,192 bitcoin (BTC). That's a bitcoin reserve ratio of 101%, a slight decline from 102% disclosed in the first report released on Nov. 22.The reserve ratio for leading stablecoin tether (USDT) held steady at 101%, while ether's (ETH) reserve ratio ticked higher to 103% from 102%. The exchange addresses tracked by analytics firm Nansen show BTC, ETH and USDT make up over 90% of holdings.Proof of reserves is an audit method adopted by cryptocurrency exchanges in the aftermath of FTX's collapse to prove that the custodian, in this case OKX, isn't lending out customer funds, as FTX did, and has the assets it claims to hold on behalf of its users. These reports have, nevertheless, been criticized for not providing information about liabilities and internal quality controls, a focal point in the crypto community. For instance, Binance's recent proof of reserves report from French audit firm Mazars was criticized for lack of details about the way exchange liquidates assets to cover margin loans.OKX said in a press release shared with CoinDesk that it would release proof of funds on the 22nd day of each month to win customer trust and allow users to audit its 23,000 addresses, which the exchange plans to continue using in the future.Users can now view and download the old and new reserve ratios and assess the exchange's health and the safety of their assets.“Publishing PoR results on a monthly basis strengthens our commitment to lead the industry when it comes to transparency and trust,” Chief Marketing Officer Haider Rafique said in the release. “At OKX, we believe that PoR should be verifiable via open source tools so that users can self-verify the balances and ownership of our reserve addresses.”",2022/12/23
39,"Over 100 bitcoin belonging to collapsed crypto exchange QuadrigaCX has left wallets tied to the exchange, with a majority flowing through a privacy tool. That probably isn’t good news.You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.QuadrigaCX is back in the news! For those of you who weren’t here back then: A Canadian crypto exchange collapsed in dramatic fashion in January 2019 after its founder apparently passed away in India due to complications from Crohn’s disease.It turned out the exchange owed thousands of customers around $200 million in crypto (at prices at the time). It later came out that the exchange’s founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten, had misappropriated customer funds for personal purposes. He also left behind little paperwork or records, making it difficult for investigators to actually verify what assets or liabilities Quadriga had... Sound familiar?That’s ancient history by current standards. Ernst and Young, a Big Four auditor, is acting as the company’s bankruptcy trustee and has spent much of the last 3+ years investigating Quadriga, trying to find the company’s assets and recover what funds it could. The Canada Revenue Agency is also digging into Quadriga, checking on taxes the exchange may not have filed when it was operating.Early on, in February 2019, EY revealed it had accidentally sent over 100 bitcoin (BTC) to what it described as Quadriga’s cold wallets, which it could not access.Last Friday, someone pulled all 104 BTC out. And promptly moved at least 70 or so of that to Wasabi Wallet, a privacy service. EY confirmed it wasn’t anyone on the auditor’s team, implying someone has either had access to these wallets for the last four years or someone found the keys after nearly four years. Either way, it’s yet another blow to the crypto exchange, which is still going through its bankruptcy proceedings.Crypto analytics firm Chainalysis said the movements are similar to bitcoin that left defunct trading service BTC-e’s wallets a few weeks ago.This is obviously not great news. EY and Miller Thomson, the law firm representing Quadriga creditors, did not return requests for comment earlier this week. In nearly identical statements, the two firms said they were investigating the “unauthorized transactions.”A number of questions will have to be answered. Why did EY believe the addresses in question were cold wallets, and what work have they done over the past four years to try and verify that they couldn’t find the keys?Furthermore, the case at this point appears to be held up largely by the Canada Revenue Agency, but EY hasn’t published any reports on the bankruptcy case since January 2021, and its last notice to creditors was in February 2021. Crypto prices have changed dramatically since then, so it’s unclear what exactly creditors will recover.Sam Bankman-Fried is now in the U.S., having been extradited Wednesday from the Bahamas, just over a week after police in the Bahamas arrested him.While he was in the air, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams announced that Bankman-Fried’s former associates – onetime Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX-co-founder Gary Wang – had pleaded guilty to various charges and were cooperating with prosecutors.

40,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin avoids losses in U.S. stocks as strong economic data makes investors reconsider expectations that the Federal Reserve will pivot anytime soon to a more dovish monetary policy.Insights: Central Bank of Indonesia white paper on the development of the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) envisions a world with a government-sanctioned payment layer.Bitcoin dodges stock sell-offBy Bradley KeounBitcoin (BTC) was flat over the past 24 hours, on a day where U.S. stocks sold off. Positive economic data rekindled fears that the Federal Reserve may need to keep tightening monetary policy longer than expected – a trend that has put downward pressure on risky asset prices all year. (Check out Glenn Williams Jr.'s analysis here.)The largest cryptocurrency by market volume was trading above $16,800, down just 0.01% over 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the second largest, was trading around $1,223, up 0.82%. The CoinDesk Market Index was up 0.5%Messari's Ryan Selkis, in a 168-page report on his 2023 predictions, wrote the market's direction is ""still all about macro and regulation.""""The resting market sentiment is that we will have a recession in 2023, with some debate over its potential magnitude. The market also seems to trust that central banks will continue to tighten until inflation is under control. Though contrarian, there are some investors who think it’s more likely that the Fed will pivot once the recession really gets going and accept multi-year high inflation in lieu of a depression or global reserve currency crisis.""Web3, DeFi at the center of Indonesian CBDCBy Glenn Ardi, CoinDesk IndonesiaThe Central Bank of Indonesia’s white paper about the development of the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) stands in contrast to China’s: It envisions a world where the government permits, and controls, Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) by providing a government-sanctioned payment layer instead of trying to eliminate it.Indonesia’s population has fully embraced crypto. Based on data from the Indonesian Commodity Futures Trading Authority (Bappebti), the number of registered crypto accounts hit 16.3 million as of September 2022, with a year-over-year growth rate of 81.6%.While the Central Bank of Indonesia sees some negative parts to crypto, such as the ability for it to operate as a ""shadow central bank,"" it knows it needs to work on keeping up, but also not getting in the way either, and with that it's developing a digital form of the Rupiah known as Project Garuda, Indonesia’s CBDC. At this point, crypto is too big in Indonesia to ban, so why not work with the industry and provide regulated payment layers, the prevailing logic goes.“[A] CBDC fills the gap left by existing money by acting as the core instrument for central banks to maintain monetary and financial system stability within digital ecosystem,” a whitepaper from the Bank on the CBDC reads.The bank envisions a market where crypto exists as part of a broader ecosystem, with on-ramps to and from CBDC.“Activities within the Web 3.0 ecosystem, including crypto asset transactions, also add to the complexity of controlling financial systems, both in the context of mitigating micro-financial and macro-financial risks,” the paper reads. “Central banks would need to find a future-proof solution to maintain public trust in them with regards to carrying out their mandate in the digital era.”The Indonesian CBDC, according to the white paper, will be the method of settlement for traditional and digital ecosystem including DeFi, the metaverse and Web3. Cryptocurrency is fine, the prevailing thought seems to go, provided that a digital form of the Rupiah is the dominant means of settlement.This stands in contrast to China’s approach. The country has largely banned most kinds of cryptocurrencies and prohibits crypto transactions almost entirely. The People’s Bank of China white paper on its CBDC mentions cryptocurrency as a concern but takes particular issue with stablecoins, saying they will bring “risks and challenges” to the global financial system.But for Indonesia, stablecoins aren’t a problem. The country already has a handful of rupiah-backed stablecoins such as the BIDR, IDRT or IDK. A big market for these stablecoins is Indonesia’s large diaspora of migrant workers as overseas remittances is a big source of income for the country.In theory, a CBDC could be swapped for a stablecoin, then sent abroad. This method would also have the benefit of allowing authorities to monitor for tax compliance.Still, all this is a long way from being finalized. “The current whitepaper is still high level and theoretical and plans to be implemented,” Asih Karnengsih, chairwoman of Indonesia Blockchain Association, told CoinDesk. “The implementation of the CBDC will take many stakeholders to be involved and the real challenge will be how to invite these stakeholders to join the CBDC system.”But there are security risksA CBDC means that the government would have a lot of information on transactions and users. And Indonesia doesn’t have the best record for IT security.In January 2022, the Central Bank of Indonesia suffered a ransomware attack that resulted in 74.82 GB of data being leaked. A few months later the country’s national electoral commission was hacked, and the personal information of 105 million Indonesian citizens was sold on the dark web. This comes two years after the same department was hacked, resulting in a leak of 2.3 million voter records.Considering the government’s poor track record of IT security, is it really a good idea to give them so much more information? A CBDC would have details about every transaction a person makes. What price would that fetch on the dark web?In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Sam Bankman-Fried in FBI Custody, Former Associates Plead Guilty: Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda Research, and FTX co-founder Gary Wang plead guilty to fraud charges in the FTX case, seeming to turn against their former boss Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces similar charges.

41,"Known cryptocurrency payments to ransomware hackers “totaled a mere $16 million, compared to nearly $74 million USD in 2021,” blockchain intelligence firm Crystal Blockchain says.This may be surprising given the fact that the number of ransomware attacks has increased since 2021, according to cybersecurity researchers. This year, the notorious Conti ransomware gang, known for terrorizing U.S. hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, ceased operations, but new groups are constantly emerging.Nick Smart, Crystal’s director of blockchain intelligence, told CoinDesk it may be too early to conclude that ransomware attacks are in permanent decline.“Since the Conti leaks, we were able to gather a lot more information on historical ransomware and extortion activity, which is to say we have a better idea of what it was like before. Due to the way ransoms generally work, it’s not possible to tell what happened now as many companies don’t disclose payment information publicly,” Smart said.Analysis of on-chain activity shows that crypto services with a high money laundering risk score – meaning they receive funds from scams and cybercrime more often than others – are seeing a drop in popularity, the report says.“We can see that overall, crypto funds are increasingly exchanged between lower-risk [virtual asset service providers] likely due to increased regulation, registration and client expectations,” the report reads.At the same time, crypto exchanges and services that manage to keep “dirty” crypto out, have been further tightening anti-money laundering policies, effectively scaring away criminal actors: “The volume of funds sent to low-risk exchanges from scams fell by 24% in 2022 compared to 2021,” the report said.Offline wallets, allowing users to directly control their funds, are becoming increasingly popular among crypto users in general, the report says: more funds are being sent to such addresses.Cross-chain bridges remain popular for illicit transactions. The Bitcoin-to-Ethereum bridge service Ren, for example, received almost a half of all crypto from sanctioned entities, the report said. The service, linked to now-failed exchange FTX, is popular among hackers.“Perhaps the biggest endorsement of this trend was the FTX thief, who almost drained the entire of the protocol’s liquidity crossing chains,” Smart says. That’s not something new: Cybercriminals have been actively using Ren even before. However, the recent enforcement actions benefited the protocol.“I think a lot of the attention on Ren grew after Tornado Cash was sanctioned [by the U.S. Treasury Department], which goes to show that criminals are always evolving tactics to try and beat blockchain intelligence companies and compliance teams,” Smart said.",2022/12/22

43,"In a world where giants of the conventional financial system including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal employ tens of thousands of employees, Bitcoin continues to be run by a tight ship of just a few dozen active developers.New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG), a Bitcoin-focused investment firm, published a report in September chronicling Bitcoin’s 14-year evolution from a software development perspective. The report, titled “Developers of Bitcoin,” found that there are only 40 to 60 active developers. The document sheds light on how Bitcoin has steadily grown from an obscure technological breakthrough, to worldwide domination, and examines the software developers who made it all happen.What’s most mind-boggling, perhaps, is how the world’s most dominant cryptocurrency, currently worth about $320 billion, has been chugging along with no major hiccups for almost 14 years, under the care of a passionate – but small – group scattered across the globe.“The purpose of the report was to help people understand Bitcoin’s development cycle: How it evolved from an idea circulated on a mailing group, to a pervasive technology today. And then, who are the people who continue to update the [Bitcoin] protocol,” explained Greg Cipolaro in a recent interview with CoinDesk. Cipolaro is NYDIG’s global head of research and co-author of the report.Read more: So You Want to Be a Bitcoin Developer?Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder, published his white paper on Oct. 31, 2008, and subsequently launched the Bitcoin network on Jan. 3, 2009. He was soon joined by five other contributors, notably Hal Finney, a developer and cypherpunk who became the first bitcoin transaction recipient (courtesy of Satoshi), and Laszlo Hanyec, a programmer who famously paid 10,000 BTC (almost $170 million today) for two pizzas.Read more: What Is Bitcoin Pizza Day?With Satoshi at the helm, a community formed, but by 2010 that community had outgrown its founder. Realizing this, Satoshi gave Gavin Andresen the keys to the kingdom. Andresen, who was then an active contributor to the project, became Bitcoin’s “lead developer” and moved the project to open source collaboration platform, GitHub, paving the way for true decentralization.“In a final email to developer Mike Hearn, Satoshi declared, ‘I’ve moved on to other things. It’s in good hands with Gavin and everyone,’” the report states.Nowadays, Bitcoin developers can be found worldwide. Roughly 84% of its GitHub commits – or suggested software changes – come from 20 different countries.“One of the interesting things I thought we uncovered in the report is the geographic location of the developers,” said Cipolaro. “It’s helpful for investors who may be concerned about who's contributing and updating this piece of software. We know who they are and most of them seem to be in North America, Western Europe, those types of geographies.”Another shift is the recent shelving of the lead developer/maintainer role in favor of a more egalitarian model that elects a group of maintainers instead. A “maintainer” is essentially a GitHub administrator with permission to approve software changes suggested by other developers.Earlier this year, Gloria Zhao became the first female Bitcoin maintainer in the community's history.According to the report, “code contributions have reached 200-400 commits monthly,” a steady, measured progression. And although Bitcoin’s core protocol averages 40 to 60 monthly active developers, 1,140 developers have contributed to the project since inception, with 5 to 20 new developers testing the waters every month (as others either scale back or leave).The broader ecosystem (developers working on Bitcoin related applications) follows a similar pattern, but, of course, with higher numbers. NYDIG estimates the number of monthly active developers in that wider community to be anywhere from 600 to 1,000, with the total number of contributors being over 13,000 since inception.When compared to competing networks, Bitcoin always seems to come out smaller, but exponentially more efficient. For example, previous estimates from venture firm, Electric Capital’s 2021 developer report, show Ethereum has over 4,000 monthly active developers in its broader ecosystem, compared to Bitcoin’s 600 to 1,000, yet Ethereum’s current market capitalization is less than half of Bitcoin’s.Similarly, traditional payment firms such as Visa and Mastercard, with market capitalizations comparable to Bitcoin’s, are run by tens of thousands of full-time employees. (Bitcoin developers are all volunteers, many of whom are part time.) These numbers seem to not only illustrate the “ultra lean” nature of the Bitcoin machine, but also, the purpose-driven orientation of its contributors.“Do you want the missionaries or the mercenaries? Do you want hired guns to come build things and then they leave when the money's gone, or do you want the missionaries who are here for a purpose?” said Cipolaro. “I think the people who are here for philosophical or ideological reasons tend to stay around longer and make more contributions than those who are just here for the money.”",2022/12/22
44,"Good news is bad news again: Just as traders in cryptocurrencies and traditional finance were looking forward to saying goodbye to 2022, a dose of better-than-expected economic data may have damped the mood for asset prices yet again.At the risk of sounding absurdly obvious, inflation remains an albatross around the neck of global economies. The gallows mentality of markets was that as economic data worsened with growing predictions of a U.S. recession in 2023, the Federal Reserve and other major central banks would ease off on their push to tighten monetary policy – perhaps the single biggest source of downward pressure on asset prices all year.So data released Thursday suggesting the economy might still be humming along has suddenly reversed the narrative. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks tumbled 2.8%, the biggest single-day drop in three months. Bitcoin (BTC) is down 1.1% over the past 24 hours, based on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.The challenge with inflation is that it impacts everyone, and that's a key reason the Fed is unlikely to let up. The decision to purchase a financial asset, whether bitcoin, equities or anything else, is usually discretionary. The decision to purchase food, energy and household goods is not.Declines in asset prices generally burden the owners of those assets. Increases in overall prices act as a flat tax on essentially everybody.The economic data released Thursday shows that this tax isn’t set to decrease just yet.Initial jobless claims: Initial jobless claims of 216,000 were lower than the expected 225,000. Continuing jobless claims were stronger than expected as well.While on the surface this appears to be good news, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized that the labor market needs to “soften.”In the Fed’s view, labor market demand is out of balance with supply. The stronger-than-expected report raises the possibility that the Fed will continue attempts to slow overall job growth to keep wage increases in check.David Tepper, a top-performing hedge fund manager, told CNBC on Thursday, “When the Fed says they’re going to do something, I tend to believe them.”Gross Domestic Product (GDP): The U.S. economy’s third-quarter growth was revised higher to 3.2% from the 2.9% estimate released on Nov. 30. This should also be filed under the “good news = bad news” category. The Federal Reserve would likely prefer to see a contraction of growth as a necessary evil to quell price increases. Much of the growth was driven by increases in consumer spending, which will put upward pressure on prices.GDP Price Index (GDP Price Deflator): The U.S. GDP price index rose 4.4% in the third quarter to a record high. A distinction between the consumer price index and the GDP Price Deflator is that the deflator is designed to capture changes in prices for all final goods and services. The CPI, by contrast, measures price changes for a “basket of goods.” The Deflator is often viewed as a more comprehensive look at price increases. Its move to a record high is likely the exact opposite of what the Federal Reserve wants to see.What does this mean for crypto prices?It’s challenging to find anything positive for crypto prices in these reports.Strong jobs data and economic growth lead to higher prices, increasing the Federal Reserve’s motivation to put a lid on all three. This in turn leads to a decline in asset prices, impacting both traditional and digital assets.Investors in traditional equities should expect to see a negative reaction to positive data as well.

45,"Australian computer scientist Craig Wright may be ratcheting down a multi-year effort to convince courts that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.Wright first caused an uproar in the Bitcoin community with a 2016 blog post in which he claimed – with questionable evidence – to be Bitcoin’s inventor. He’s since gone to court defending his claim, filing lawsuits containing accusations ranging from libel (where he sued Magnus Granath, also known as “Hodlonaut,” for calling him a fraud) to copyright infringement (where Wright successfully petitioned courts to have the Bitcoin white paper removed from bitcoin.org).After six years in the spotlight, Wright seemed to suggest via Twitter on Wednesday that he would finally put his Satoshi court crusade to rest.“I have been too angry for too long, as I cared for external validation. That ends,” he tweeted.“I no longer care what you think. I care for my wife, my mother, and my family,” Wright said. “The only validation I seek now is from my family. The rest is no longer important.”Wright’s tweet thread followed the latest in a series of blows to his Bitcoin inventor claim, which he has thus far struggled to back up with concrete proof in the eyes of courts and much of the public. Just before Wright’s tweets, a judge unequivocally stated that “[i]t is important to be clear that Dr. Wright has not established that he is Satoshi” in the final judgment in a defamation case between Wright and podcast personality Peter McCormack.Although Wright may indeed take a break from litigation, it doesn’t seem he’ll be backing away from his claim to be Satoshi anytime soon. “Creator of Bitcoin” is still proudly displayed on his Twitter profile and website.Per one of Wright’s tweets on Wednesday, “My vision is my goal, and I will never stop working to achieve it.”Read more: Craig Wright’s Satoshi Proofs ‘Not Credible’ and a ‘Farce,’ Hodlonaut Lawyers SayCORRECTION (Dec. 23, 2022 15:02 UTC): Corrected Granath's alias in second paragraph.",2022/12/22
46,"Tron founder Justin Sun is one of the richest figures in crypto, and a good chunk of his bitcoin (BTC) is stored in one place: U.S.-based Valkyrie Investments.The altcoin kingpin had more than $580 million of BTC stashed with the crypto asset manager at one point in August, according to a private financial document that CoinDesk reviewed. That amounted to over 90% of money at Valkyrie’s largest division, Valkyrie Digital Assets LLC, the document shows.In other words, Valkyrie Investments, a money manager that pitches crypto products to Wall Street investors, mostly relied on Justin Sun, a controversial Chinese crypto billionaire. (The current state of Valkyrie’s assets is unknown.) Sun has also said he’s one of Valkyrie’s biggest shareholders.It’s yet another example of centralization in crypto, an industry rife with whales carrying outsize clout, in spite of its decentralized ideals.Sun’s relationship with Valkyrie popped up in ways that benefited his empire. For example, Valkyrie built investment products for “Justin tokens” such as Tron’s TRX and BitTorrent BTT that other crypto asset managers say they avoid. It promoted Tron using the blockchain network’s developers’ own marketing materials. It even let Tron share its spotlight on Wall Street – literally – with someone wearing a T-shirt bearing the Tron logo joining Valkyrie’s bell-ringing at Nasdaq in September.The financial lives of individuals are almost always nobody’s business. Sun’s previously undisclosed, outsized percentage of Valkyrie’s assets under management (AUM) is an exception. The depth of the relationship is a matter of public interest because it raises questions about Valkyrie’s reliance on a single client for growth.Sun is a notable and polarizing figure in the crypto industry. He is the founder of the Tron blockchain, which has spawned repeated controversy. Tron issued, for example, an algorithmic stablecoin that researchers derided as a “clone” of the doomed UST/LUNA setup.Valkyrie Investments Chief Investment Officer Steve McClurg would not discuss the source of Valkyrie’s client funds, citing confidentiality. Sun didn’t respond to a request for comment.Sun’s money touched every section of the business, from separately managed accounts to trusts and even Valkyrie’s bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF). Having large assets under management (AUM) can help a fund manager promote itself to prospective clients and also potential financial backers. Bigger is generally better.For a few months this year, Valkyrie did have another whale, or major investor: It signed a $700 million partnership to manage treasury funds for crypto protocol NEM/Symbol in January. Weeks later, the company said its AUM had surpassed $1 billion, according to a February press release. But that deal fell apart in months and NEM/Symbol took back its tokens, according to people at the protocol.McClurg told CoinDesk that Valkyrie continues to partner with NEM/Symbol. That protocol does not appear on the private Valkyrie document that CoinDesk reviewed.Tokens from Sun's Tron blockchain anchored Valkyrie’s TRX trust, its largest trust at $37 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.Also, Sun in October 2021 called himself the largest investor in Valkyrie’s bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF).It’s not exactly clear why Sun, a knowledgeable crypto founder who recently told CoinDesk he self-custodies most of his tokens (and also has custody partnerships with Binance, Huobi and Fireblocks) would put so much bitcoin in a pricey SMA.SMAs are portfolio management products that Valkyrie sells to investors who want to directly own their crypto but leave the fuss of buying and selling to a money manager. It charged a 1.5% fee when it officially launched its SMA service in October.John Key, the former head of Valkyrie’s SMA product, said Sun’s SMA was an institutional-type product that differed from the retail offerings.Having one whale in an SMA doesn’t necessarily pose a threat to clients with money in other products. But it could become problematic for the asset manager’s fee revenue – and its ability to pay staff – if that client ever decided to leave.“If you had a hedge fund that had six pieces out of seven in the hands of one player, you couldn't swing the budget, if you know what I mean,” said Chris McHugh, an economics professor at Tufts University.Sun may have been Valkyrie’s private whale, but he’s a vocal backer of the Nashville, Tennessee-based firm. He joined its mid-2021 equity round and his Tron blockchain called Valkyrie a “strategic partner” when it launched Tron Trust three months later. As an equity investor in the business, his incentives appear to be heavily aligned with Valkyrie’s.On Valkyrie’s end, CEO and founder Leah Wald has taken a board position at crypto exchange Huobi, which Sun reportedly acquired. Sun is also a board member.Crypto trusts are private investment funds that give accredited investors a way to buy exposure to cryptocurrencies without holding any tokens. Firms such as Bitwise, Osprey, Valkyrie and Grayscale (CoinDesk’s corporate sibling) sell trusts covering a range of cryptocurrencies to the Wall Street crowd. But only Valkyrie sells a TRX trust. Valkyrie also created – but didn’t launch – a BitTorrent trust product.Sun viewed Valkyrie as the Tron ecosystem’s access route to U.S. investors, according to his public statements. In September 2021 he said Tron would work with Valkyrie to list its Tron trust on over-the-counter markets and ultimately help it create a Tron ETF. Both steps would mainstream the cryptocurrency in the U.S. Neither event has come to pass.For its part, Valkyrie discusses its Tron trust with a document chock full of platitudes, buzzwords and paragraphs lifted verbatim from Tron’s own website.“The TRON network completed full decentralization in Dec 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO,” the April 2022 document, which carries Valkyrie’s logo, declared as it parroted language seen on Tron.network in January. At least seven sections of the document appear to be taken directly from other sources without citing them.Though he wouldn’t discuss Valkyrie’s clients, CIO McClurg confirmed that Valkyrie has a partnership with Tron.“I’ve known Justin for many years. We had representatives on the Tron hackathon, we’ve got strategic partnerships with them” and other protocols, he said.The partnership has seen Valkyrie toy with creating trusts for one Sun-linked token that two other asset managers, who requested anonymity, said they would never touch: BitTorrent, software for sharing – or pirating – files. Tron bought BitTorrent for $120 million in 2018 and promptly launched a BTT token to incentivize users.Valkyrie signaled its intent to create a BTT trust with an August 2022 fact sheet and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing in October. McClurg said Valkyrie didn’t move forward with the fund because of the rocky crypto market.Valkyrie’s own finances have been battered by the crashing markets. In recent days it fired 30% of its staff in response to “a thorough review of asset growth.” It also lost its biggest investor in an earlier funding round.Still, McClurg said Valkyrie is soldiering on.“The company’s in a good position. Despite the crypto winter we're growing again,” he said.",2022/12/22
47,"Guggenheim Partners Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd, a top Wall Street financier who made waves in crypto markets for his ever-shifting calls on bitcoin's price, died Wednesday after a heart attack at the age of 63.The firm announced his death in a statement Thursday. He was a regular presence on the financial-news cable network CNBC. According to the statement, he had become the public speaker for Guggenheim, along with serving as a senior leader and a mentor.""Scott was a key innovator and thought leader who was instrumental in building Guggenheim Investments into the global business it is today,"" CEO Mark Walter said in the statement.Among investment executives in traditional finance, Minerd was notoriously willing to venture predictions on the bitcoin (BTC) price, some of them quite extreme, and typically with mixed success.In December 2020, for example, when bitcoin was trading around $20,000, he said that the cryptocurrency ""should be worth around $400,000."" The BTC price climbed to just above $40,000 in January 2021 and peaked around $69,000 late last year.In May, when bitcoin was around $29,000, he told CNBC it could fall to $8,000. It's now around $16,600.As recently as last week, he told Bloomberg Television that there was ""another shoe to drop"" from last month's collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX crypto exchange.""This is just like any number of periods where we had easy money and a lot of speculation,"" he told the channel. ""The weakest players fall first. Crypto was obviously something that is crazy.""",2022/12/22
48,"Bitcoin miners operating in northern Norway and Sweden, where they sought refuge from sky-high electricity prices earlier this year, are powering down for the winter as energy tariffs surge.Just a few months ago, European miners flocked to the continent’s northernmost regions, which have among the cheapest power prices in the world due to abundant hydroelectric power and low demand, as prices across the continent soared. Some even left for the Americas. Now they’re facing record-high prices – and it is only the start of winter, when demand rises for heating.December electricity prices in northern Norway have averaged 18 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) this year, about four times the average of the previous three years, data from the European power exchange Nordpool shows. In Sweden prices are more than three times as high.“It was a shocking alignment of events,” which squeezed the only available energy surplus in northern Norway and Sweden, pushing up tariffs, said Denis Rusinovich, co-founder of mining firms CMG Cryptocurrency Mining Group and Maverick Group.Late November was hit by a combination of low temperatures, which increased the demand for power; a distinct lack of wind that hampered power generation in the U.K., Norway, Sweden and Germany; and delays in scheduled nuclear plant maintenance in France, Sweden and Finland exacerbated by pressure on the supply of natural gas due to the conflict in Ukraine, Rusinovich said.The resulting jump in prices forced miners to turn off their machines to save on power costs. Some had shut down as early as mid-November, Rusinovich said.“We assess every day what the hourly prices are and if it's above or below breakeven, then we make a decision whether to switch on or off,” Kjetil Pettersen, CEO of Norway-based Kryptovault, told CoinDesk on Tuesday. “At this moment, our miners are shut off.” Kryptovault relocated to the north of the country earlier this year.Pettersen said he expects northern Norway power prices to come back down in the first quarter of 2023. Power prices across southern Europe, however, will stay high for 2023, he said.Miners will remain offline in Europe during the energy crisis as a means of self-preservation, Pettersen said. Whether they can survive without mining revenue depends on their reserve capital and ability to raise more funds, he said.Also pertinent: their level of debt.“If you need to reimburse capital, you cannot survive more than a couple of months because you need to repay the debt holders,” said Fiorenzo Manganiello, founder of UAE-based Cowa Energy, who also flagged Iceland as a viable option for mining.Unsustainable leverage has brought several miners in the U.S. to their knees. Large companies such as Core Scientific (CORZ) and Compute North have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Manganiello sees this as an opportunity to buy distressed assets.Mining sites are currently being sold at an 85%-90% discount, he said. During the bull market, miners were selling facilities, without mining machines, for $1.5 million per megawatt. Today, the figure is closer to $100,000 to $150,000 per MW, he said.Read more: Miners Take Off for The Great – and More Profitable – NorthCORRECTION (Dec. 22 16:35 UTC):  Removes reference to Cowa Energy being London-based.

49,"The Certified Financial Planner (CFP) Board dropped its “Notice to CFP Professionals Regarding Financial Advice about Cryptocurrency-related Assets” on Dec. 5.The board's notice is a 14-page report that outlines a series of risks associated with cryptocurrency investment. It lays out some standards that financial advisors can adhere to in their decision to provide, or not provide, advice on cryptocurrency investment.By the CFP Board’s definition, this advice includes “communications that, based on their content, context and presentation, would reasonably be viewed as a recommendation to take or refrain from taking a particular course of action.”You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.In short, the report elucidates the CFP Board’s “Code and Standards,” which neither prohibits advisors from giving advice on crypto nor inhibits them from not giving any advice on it. It emphasizes that financial advisors must adhere to Fiduciary Duty when giving advice on crypto by fully taking into account the goals, risk tolerances and personal/financial circumstances of the client. And it underscores the standards of competency necessary in giving crypto-related advice.The report does spell out, “The CFP Board’s Code and Standards does not require a CFP professional to offer Financial Advice to a Client on every Financial Asset that is available in the marketplace. A CFP professional does not violate the Code and Standards when the CFP professional does not provide Financial Advice about cryptocurrency-related assets.”However, the CFP Board’s precaution on advice giving should be interpreted to mean that crypto-uneducated financial advisors should not only avoid giving advice in support of cryptocurrency, but also giving advice in opposition to it.Financial advisors uneducated about crypto can no longer legitimately argue that cryptocurrencies are “Ponzi,” “beanie babies” or “tulips,” as all of those characterizations are not founded in facts or research. The statements might work over a beer with friends but not in financial planning with clients. In such settings, misrepresenting bitcoin is a form of advice – and there are far too many advisors currently in this camp.Read more: Worse Than Tulip Mania? Common Misconceptions About Crypto AssetsThe notice mentions, “A CFP professional must satisfy the Fiduciary Duty, which provides that a CFP professional must act as a fiduciary, and therefore, act in the client's best interests, at all times when providing Financial Advice to a Client.”This means that if you as a financial advisor feel it is irresponsible and not logical for your client to invest in crypto, then you should advise against it.That said, I have not seen a single advisor make a specific and compelling case against an allocation to bitcoin. Whereas mathematics favors adding bitcoin, FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) most often gets in the way.Bitcoin is not going to disappear because the FTX crypto exchange was allegedly a criminal enterprise. Bitcoin will remain around for generations to come because bitcoin is money, helps small business owners and helps solves ESG concerns.Not only that, information on how to more intelligently gain exposure to a variety of crypto assets is now available. The Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), created by CoinDesk Indices, provides reliable, comprehensive and standardized industry definitions and classifications for digital assets.Read more: Introducing CoinDesk Indices' Digital Asset Classification StandardIt is wholly and entirely up to each advisor to refrain from providing advice.But the report explains that “A CFP Professional Must Comply with the Duty of Competence When Providing Financial Advice About Cryptocurrency-Related Assets.”I don’t have an opinion on every esoteric investment strategy – and you don’t need to either. But it’s important that, as advisors, we be honest with clients when there is an area of investment that we are not fully educated on.Most advisors’ commentary on crypto should be, “I haven’t done the work to provide any analysis on it.” In my opinion, this applies to 90%+ of all advisors.That said, cryptocurrency has gone mainstream, so there is less and less room for excuses on why you haven’t spent time researching this growing asset class. CNBC even has bitcoin listed on its ticker tape – so clients of all ages are seeing it and hearing about it and they’re going to be asking you questions about it.I recommend that in 2023 you commit yourself to becoming more educated about cryptocurrency as a financial advisor. Fortunately, there are some great resources to do that.For books, I recommend reading ""The Bitcoin Standard,"" ""The Price of Tomorrow: Why Deflation Is the Key to an Abundant Future,"" ""The Bullish Case for Bitcoin"" and ""Inventing Bitcoin: The Technology Behind The First Truly Scarce and Decentralized Money Explained.""For podcasts, check out ""Bitcoin Fundamentals"" and ""Bitcoin Audible.""And finally, this blog post here is great: ""Gradually, Then Suddenly.""As an advisor, know there are peers out there that can and will help you learn. There will be and are advisors focused on gathering knowledge and helping clients navigate bitcoin.I’ve been fortunate to connect with other advisors and recently helped start the Bitcoin Financial Advisors Network. But be prepared. People at such events might ask hard questions and encourage you to dig deeper into preconceived notions.It’s time we as a financial industry hold ourselves to a higher standard when talking about bitcoin with clients, given that as a CFP you are allowed to discuss and recommend it.The key is getting educated because you are not protecting clients from bitcoin by not learning about it. Taking personal responsibility to educate yourself cannot be overstated in crypto. As they say, “Don’t Trust, Verify.”",2022/12/22
50,"The crypto market has recently held steady, with bitcoin locked in the narrow range of $16,000 to $18,000 amid lingering macroeconomic uncertainty and FTX contagion fears.The perplexing tranquility may soon fade because bitcoin's historical volatility hits levels last seen before the late 2020 bull run and investors with ample capital supply begin to accumulate coins.""The quiet price action of the past month is illustrated by [bitcoin's] low realized volatility. Not counting the moment leading up to the FTX fallout, which had slightly higher volatility than what we have now, this is the lowest level for realized volatility since the third quarter of 2020, just before the last bull run. Prior to that instance, volatility was this low at the bottom of the 2018 bear market,"" Blockware's weekly report said.""Calm waters do not last long in bitcoin, so be prepared for a sharp move here shortly,"" the report added.Realized volatility refers to the magnitude of daily price movements, irrespective of direction, over a specific period. It's a backward-looking metric, while the implied volatility is forward-looking, revealing options traders' expectations for price turbulence over the coming week/month.Bitcoin's annualized one-month realized volatility fell to a two-year low of 38% last week.""Investors should prepare for another swift move soon because smooth sailing does not endure in the crypto market for long,"" the Dec. 12 issue of Bitfinex's Alpha report said, referring to the ultra-low realized volatility.The report added that an uptick in implied volatility with an extended period of low realized volatility is followed by wild price fluctuations.At press time, short-term and long-term implied volatility metrics remain depressed in line with the realized volatility. The low implied volatility means the market is not forecasting a big move.The situation, however, could change after the holiday season, with traders snapping up options and pushing implied volatility higher relative to historical volatility.The renewed accumulation of BTC by whales, or investors with ample capital supply and the ability to move markets, is another reason to expect some action in the market.Large wallets have accumulated over 400,000 BTC ($6.73 billion) since the cryptocurrency fell below the June low of $18,000 on Nov. 9, Bitfinex report noted, quoting data from on-chain analytics platform Whalemap.The white line is bitcoin's daily close price (UTC), and the bubbles' size represents the number of coins accumulated by the whale wallets.""Over the past week, large or 'whale-styled' wallets have experienced an inflow of over 70,000 BTC. Around 120K BTC was accumulated at the $16,100 level, which offers potential support given the scale of buying,"" Bitfinex said.""At press time, bitcoin traded flat-to-positive near $16,900, according to CoinDesk data.",2022/12/22

""Over the past five years, all major price reversals in BTC have preceded those in major equity indices.""It shows bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, are looked upon by investors as more risky assets than stocks. As Brookings Institutions' Eswar Prasad noted last year, bitcoin has become a speculative investment.While corporate fundamentals and macroeconomic factors directly impact stocks, the crypto market is yet to develop strong links with the global economy. Digital assets, until now, have proved to be narrative-driven, with valuations almost entirely dependent on the pace of expansion in fiat currency supply, mainly the U.S. dollar and factors like inflation rate that influence the Federal Reserve policy.""The crypto market is one of the purest bets on global liquidity expansion and currency debasement. Not only is it influenced by macro factors, but when market conditions change, it’s often the first to react,"" Delphi's strategists noted.Bitcoin peaked at $69,000 on Nov. 11, 2021, or 55 days before the S&P 500 topped out at 4,818 on Jan. 4.

So why is there talk of banning it? asks Sam Reynolds.The heat is elsewhere as bitcoin hibernatesBy Brad KeounCryptocurrencies were barely budging in early Asia hours, even after a decent day of gains in U.S. stocks on Wednesday.The benchmark CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) of digital assets was down 0.3% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin was trading flat, just above $16,800.""Bitcoin isn't getting much of a boost from the positive risk-on environment that is running through Wall Street,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, wrote Wednesday in a note.The hot action was in the decentralized finance (DeFI) protocol Popsicle Finance's ICE token, which tripled over the past 24 hours after the controversial yet prolific blockchain developer Daniele Sestagalli said he was returning to the project after a hiatus.Crypto has yet to cause a fiat financial crisis. Why the talk of bans?By Sam ReynoldsWithout a doubt, the digital asset industry is in the depths of a market that looks a lot like 2008. One could even say that the elaborate DeFi protocols with questionable collateralization accelerated the market decline, in the same way that exotic derivative vehicles like collateralized debt obligations (CDO) made the 2008 crisis worse.But the damage is limited to crypto. There’s no evidence to suggest that some form of contagion has materialized that has spread over to the TradFi markets. Certainly, macroeconomic factors like interest rates and the strength of the dollar have impacted crypto, but so far this is a one-way street.The establishment sees it differently.In a recent speech, India's central bank Governor Shaktikanta Das forecasted that the next financial crisis would start with crypto and thus, it should be banned.""Our view is that it should be prohibited because if you try to regulate it and allow it to grow, please mark my words, the next financial crisis will come from private cryptocurrencies,"" CoinDesk reported Das as saying. ""They have no underlying value. They have huge inherent risks for our macro economic and financial stability. I [have] yet to hear any credible argument about what public good or what public purpose it serves.""Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the U.S. Senate Banking Committee chairman, made a similar argument during a recent appearance on the television news program ""Meet the Press"" but was able to (correctly) say that this would be difficult as it would simply force crypto to move entirely offshore.The financial crisis both are referring to is a loss of state control of money. This was also a theme in the white paper for China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC).While India has liberalized capital controls in recent years, they still exist. It maintains strict control over the nation’s money supply under the auspices of fighting inflation – which could be lethal for an emerging market with a large percentage of low earners.The U.S. doesn’t like crypto because it's a headache for its hegemonic ambitions. In a world that largely trades in dollars, U.S. control over the money supply means it can prosecute crimes when there is only a marginal connection to the country (see: Huawei, and BitMex).For lawmakers in both countries, it would be easier if crypto just ""went away."" Even after a year where there was a trifecta of calamity — Terra, Three Arrows Capital and FTX — bitcoin is still at $16,800, and the broader crypto market cap is just north of $800 billion.Crypto has weathered the storm that macroeconomic events and black swans brought upon it. Although it continues to be in the crosshairs of regulators, its problems have yet to cross the chasm into traditional finance (TradFi).

54,"The situation is “much closer to Hertz and Ford and Delta than FTX,” Core Scientific (CORZ) Chief Mining Officer Russell Cann told CoinDesk, explaining that he expects the company will emerge stronger from the reorganization process.Operating its own bitcoin (BTC) mining rigs and serving as a host for others, Core Scientific accounts for about 10% of the entire hashrate of the Bitcoin network, with computing power of nearly 25 exahash/second (EH/s). According to its Twitter, Core Scientific mines about 50 bitcoin per day for itself, and its most recent monthly update shows 1,295 bitcoin mined in October.Coming after months of turmoil for the crypto mining industry, which has been squeezed between low prices hurting revenue and higher energy costs lifting expenses, Wednesday’s Chapter 11 filing wasn’t a surprise. CORZ shares had already lost about 99% of their value over the past year, and the company had warned of a possible bankruptcy two months ago.Cann told CoinDesk that, operationally, it’s business as usual at the company, but the bankruptcy filing will now allow for “the restructure of the balance sheet.”Read more: Bitcoin Miner Core Scientific Files for Bankruptcy, Expects Support From Some Debt HoldersMost of Core Scientific’s customers that already have machines or contracts with the company’s hosting business won’t be affected by the bankruptcy, said Cann. The company, however, is considering selling two of its facilities, said Cann, but that was under consideration before the bankruptcy. The two sites are still under development and house none of their own machines, nor do they pertain to any existing hosting contracts, he said.Core Scientific has no plans to sell mining machines, unless in the normal course of business.As for Celsius Mining – Core Scientific’s largest hosting client and also going through a Chapter 11 restructuring with its parent, Celsius Network – Cann said the bankruptcy courts might get involved in their ongoing disagreement.Celsius Mining has claimed that Core Scientific violated the terms of bankruptcy by failing to host some of its machines and trying to pass through increased electricity costs. Core Scientific, meanwhile, has been routinely passing on increased energy charges to its hosting clients.The two sites that Core Scientific might be selling are in Muskogee, Oklahoma, and Barstow, Texas, that had been hoped to be operational in 2023, said Cann. “If anyone wants to turn on machines in 2023, their best shot is a site that Core has been working on for 18 to 24 months,” he said.Read more: A Huge Glut of Bitcoin Mining Rigs Is Sitting Unused in BoxesCore Scientific is in a prearranged bankruptcy, as opposed to a prepackaged or a free fall process, the chief mining officer said. That means that the company has agreement from a majority of debt holders, but not all. Bankruptcy courts can sometimes be used to force those that are holdouts to comply with the plan.One of the company’s largest unsecured creditors is investment bank B. Riley (RILY) – which earlier this week published a curious letter proposing a debt restructuring deal for Core Scientific. B. Riley is working closely with the miner, Cann said. The investment bank’s proposal required that all the equipment lenders had to agree to the plan, he added. “Since we're sitting here today, obviously, all the equipment lenders didn't agree,” Cann said.B. Riley shares are lower by 8.6% on Wednesday despite a rising stock market.According to the restructuring plan, the secured debt convertible noteholders will get equity. The current equity and unsecured holders will get warrants such that as the company grows they will get more shares, Cann explained.The plan also involves about $75 million in debtor-in-possession credit facilities. In its letter, B. Riley estimated that $72 million would give Core Scientific two years of runway.“One can argue there is no major impact on the industry – Bitcoin network continues to operate [...] and new blocks are created every 10 minutes,” said Juri Bulovic, head of mining at mining company Foundry. The bankruptcy, he said, is a good reminder of the volatility of the market.Foundry and CoinDesk share the same parent, Digital Currency Group.Foundry CEO Mike Colyer said he “has no doubt that Core's team will manage to navigate this difficult time and come out of it stronger.”At the same time, Colyer warned that “if you are caught taking on more risk at the wrong or unfortunate point in the bitcoin cycle, you may get wiped out – no matter how big or small you are, or how seasoned and experienced your team is.”“Taking leverage to hodl isn’t a great idea in bitcoin mining, which seems so obvious but also shows how easy one can be blinded during the bull market,” said Wolfie Zhao, head of research at TheMinerMag, the data and research arm of mining consultancy BlocksBridge.The bankruptcy filing might also send the share price of miners on a renewed downward trend. “This will be the first Chapter 11 of a publicly listed mining company, likely triggering a market wide sell off as investors derisk their portfolio by moving out of mining equities,” said Ethan Vera, chief operations officer at mining services firm Luxor.The situation “will make lenders, especially TradFi [traditional finance] ones, rethink how they evaluate the credit of mining companies from treasury strategy perspective when negotiating loan deals in the future,” Zhao said.",2022/12/21

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH): The largest cryptocurrency by market value looked remarkably stable Wednesday, trading around $16,780 and almost flat in the past 24 hours as traders wrestled with the uncertain market outlook for next year. ETH followed BTC’s trajectory, down 0.3% around $1,209. U.S. equities were a bit more buoyant: The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 1.5%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.4%.Waves (WAVES): The native token of decentralized blockchain dropped 5% to $1.51 on Wednesday and plunged by more than 40% over the past two weeks as Waves' founder Sasha Ivanov has asked crypto exchanges to deactivate futures markets tied to the WAVES token. The coin's slump has been attributed to the volatility of USDN, an algorithmic stablecoin that is designed to be pegged 1:1 with the U.S. dollar. The stablecoin is backed by the WAVES token and has de-pegged on multiple occasions this year.dYdX (DYDX): The token price dropped over 14% to $1.18 as many investors are “front-running a huge supply unlock that begins in February,” Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, wrote in a Wednesday note.By Glenn Williams Jr.Momentum for both BTC and ETH remains in neutral territory, using the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) as a proxy for momentum. BTC’s current RSI is approximately 49.06 – a very middling level. RSI is a technical indicator that ranges from 1 to 100. Readings over 70 imply that an asset is potentially overbought, while readings under 30 imply that an asset is possibly oversold.Searching BTC data back to 2015, and filtering for RSI levels between 49 and 50 shows 61 occurrences with an average gain of 2.2%, 30 days after the fact. For ETH, filtering for RSI levels between 47 and 49, showed 43 occurrences since 2017, with an average 30-day gain of 6.7%.Applying those performance figures to current prices, results in prices of $17,144 for bitcoin and $1,291 for ether.

56,"If there’s one big thing that the mainstream coverage has missed about the various collapses in the crypto space over the past year, it’s this:The downfall of crypto had very little to do with crypto.David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist. This article is part of Crypto 2023.Cryptocurrency is the application of blockchain technology to build uncensorable, open-access and immutable global shared ledgers – usually monetary ledgers. But the headline crimes and failures of 2023 were almost uniformly attempts to use financial engineering to turn the future value of those systems into present-day U.S. dollars.Too often, the finance bros bet big, using the same kind of fragile, nested and interlocking leverage that led to the 2008 financial crisis. Other times they used outright fraud – and they did it off-chain, playing by no rules, with no transparency. They were mistaken for part of the cryptocurrency industry, but it would have been more accurate to think of them as hangers-on and freeloaders, redirecting genuine public interest in crypto to their various unsustainable games.As in much of contemporary finance, the finance bros were extractive rather than additive. They were not builders, but instead a swarm of hatchling vampire squid, little would-be Goldmans frantically shoving their underdeveloped blood-funnels into anything that smelled like money.The epic failures of these finance vampires, plus broader economic conditions, mean that 2023 in the crypto world will be a much different year than 2021 or 2022. Hedge fund gamblers and token-shilling hype men will be relegated to supporting roles, where they belong, as the shadowy super-coders who actually make crypto exist move back into the spotlight.See also: Money Crypto Versus Tech Crypto | OpinionBut 2023 will also be different from previous “BUIDL eras,” during which huge squads of nerds were often set free to pursue whatever seemed cool to them. There will certainly still be some of that, but smart leaders will be pushing their teams much more firmly towards clearer goals: Building accessible and reliable front ends, for use cases with real-world demand, then (hopefully) generating revenue from users. The broad public now has a vague idea of what crypto is (for better or worse). The task now is finding out how to sell it as a tool rather than a speculative investment.This will mean, among other things, less speculation on new tokens, particularly the tokens for new “layer 1” blockchains. In its place will be a relative increase in attention to services that leverage existing, trusted chains and ecosystems to build services with real demand that genuinely require the benefits of blockchains – cross-border fluidity, digital permanence, uncensorability and decentralized governance.This future, of course, assumes that the finance bros have been sufficiently embarrassed to feel some vague sense of humility, and that their marks have wised up a bit. Personally, I don’t think that task is quite accomplished. Like unruly dogs beholden to their animal spirits, institutional traders and speculators may still need their noses rubbed into the mess they’ve made. So, let’s do that.Across many sectors of the economy, the 21st century role of finance has become catastrophically perverted. Rather than risking capital to generate long-term profit by building productive industries, the capital game has become about timing bubbles and picking narratives that will trick naïve investors (retail or otherwise) into becoming bag carriers. Meanwhile you, the pumper, head off to the White Lotus with the cash.This isn’t a problem specific to crypto – especially not over the past three years. The litany of overbought, undercooked and sometimes just plain rotten companies rolls off the tongue: Clover Health (a 2020 Chamath SPAC joint on the verge of delisting), Meta Platforms (rebranded around an app with no users), Nikola (an electric vehicle fraud that raised $3.2 billion), Tesla (once pumped, now dumped), Theranos ($700 million in venture capital, another fraud).The villains of the 2022 crypto collapse were, with one exception, born and bred in this darkness. They saw little more in crypto than the prospect of good hunting. Su Zhu and Kyle Davies started Three Arrows Capital to trade foreign currencies before transitioning to crypto. Sam Bankman-Fried infamously came to crypto from technical trading at Jane Street. Steve Ehrlich of Voyager Digital formerly helped run E-Trade. Alex Mashinsky was steeped in Silicon Valley tech VC and its accompanying blather. The one exception is Terra creator Do Kwon, who did build a crypto network – but did it on the shifting sands of venture capital, leverage and concealed risk.The carpetbaggers saw crypto as the next hot thing, but they clearly never understood it. Above all, they didn’t understand that good cryptos are public networks and generate returns through vastly different mechanisms than corporations. This was most clear with lending platforms including Celsius Network, Voyager and Terra’s Anchor protocol, which offered high and fairly fixed rates of return on assets that didn’t generate revenue, leading inexorably to illiquidity and collapse.A large element driving this mega-screwup was a decade of low interest rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve to drive investment. With historically safe and predictable financial options like Treasury bonds returning next to nothing, capital was pushed to the far ends of the risk curve – much of it ending up in crypto. Then, against this macroeconomic backdrop, fiscal policy was loosened to keep the economy afloat at beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excess cash found its way into bitcoin and other cryptos, which in turn found its way into emerging sub-sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). Thus “DeFi Summer” was primed.Some of blockchain’s johnny-come-latelies saw the early bubble in DeFi tokens, driven by the introduction of “yield farming,” and thought that was an enduring part of “crypto” writ large. The numbers and the jargon must have been intoxicating to them at first blush. In reality, of course, DeFi Summer was a one-time event that minted millionaires among knowledgeable insiders who navigated a minefield of smaller frauds and hacks. Durable DeFi platforms were in the end uniquely bad for the leverage gamblers, since on-chain returns are restrained by actual demand for loans – a restraint enforced by public code.This is why, while Terra and its Anchor protocol looked like DeFi, they were in fact a sham – the sky-high returns promised through deposits in Anchor were coming not from system use, but from venture capitalists and other very finite outside sources. Dragonfly’s Haseeb Qureshi goes as far as calling yield farming an expensive “customer acquisition strategy,” where rates were paid out by marketing budgets. This month provided a poetic bookend to contrast that with stable DeFi systems: While Terra blew up while offering yield as high as 20%, MakerDAO recently reactivated 1% yield as demand for its products grew. One of those systems still exists as a going concern, and the other does not.The use of VC funding to replace a functional business model is straight out of the Silicon Valley Venture Bubble playbook. Championed above all by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, the game is to subsidize user adoption then apply those “growth” figures to predict future *unsubsidized* use, attracting further investment, which is spent to subsidize more adoption.See also: FTX Showed the Problems of Centralized Finance. Note DeFi | OpinionEssentially, capital becomes a cudgel to eliminate enemies – including those with better-run businesses or superior technology – and build monopolies. While Thiel framed his game plan as a way to starve out the competition, the approach could also be considered a form of finance-driven deception.But reality is reasserting itself: Uber, founded 15 years ago, is still above all an elaborate mechanism for setting money on fire. Facebook (now Meta), the investment that made Thiel’s name, was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year. But early investors in Facebook or Uber certainly don’t care: They’ve already cashed in. This love ‘em and leave ‘em financial philandering becomes even more insidious when tokens are involved, because VCs can dump their bags on the public pretty much whenever they want.So from Silicon Valley to Wall Street, a long-term grift is being exposed. The continued rise in U.S. interest rates will peel away more strips of overcapitalized fat until, in many cases, there’s nothing left.To be clear, I’m not calling for a purge of either venture capital or hedge fund-style speculation. There are good-faith funders in the space who are genuinely interested in building big new businesses over the course of years, not just grabbing the money and running. The crypto industry has for years relied on small-time traders to provide liquidity and rigor, and they will always have a seat at the table.Unfortunately, the good funders and hard-nosed traders have been overshadowed by con artists we mistook for business people. Even more to the point, the 2020-2021 bull market distorted the natural order of things by making the finance bros the stars of the show instead of the supporting players they are meant to be. They built castles in the sky, funneling the life savings of naïve retail speculators into tokens from fundamentally flawed projects and collecting fat fees for the effort.This exemplifies the tragic curse of the financier as a species: If you only understand numbers but not where they come from, you don’t understand anything at all.And so, thoroughly spooked by crypto, institutions and hedge funds will take their ball and go home for much of 2023. Amateur day traders hoping to make life-changing money off the efforts of others will, hopefully, decide to do something more productive with their energies (and they’ll be better off for it). There will be less money to go around for developers: teams will have to go lean, and many projects (including more than a few good ones) will evaporate.See also: Andrew Keys – 10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023 | OpinionBut again, in the big picture, this is largely for the best. Crypto still has limited capacity to responsibly absorb capital: contra Peter Thiel, you can’t simply spend your way to adoption of something so novel and complex. Actual developers working on crypto projects are still in the low thousands.But for the next two years at least, smaller funders, more firmly rooted in the ideals and technology of crypto, will be in pole position on good deals and ideas. They’ll do what financiers are actually meant to do – not farm hype and magazine covers for themselves, but help the actual builders do their jobs.",2022/12/21
57,"Bitcoin and ether continue to trade flat, as volatility for the two assets wanes.Bitcoin (BTC) prices stabilized following the FTX fallout, now off a mere 2% from Nov. 11. The ether price (ETH) is down a more pronounced 6% from the same date.The most recent six months of trading activity for BTC has followed a familiar, if not exhausting pattern.Number 3 is where we are now.Predicting the length of time that crypto assets will remain range-bound is challenging, if not foolhardy. There are some cues to pay attention to, however.Momentum for both BTC and ETH remains in neutral territory, using the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) as a proxy for momentum. BTC’s current RSI is approximately 49.06 – a very middling level. RSI is a technical indicator that ranges from 1-100. Readings over 70 imply that an asset is potentially overbought, while readings under 30 imply that an asset is possibly oversold.Searching BTC data back to 2015, and filtering for RSI levels between 49 and 50 shows 61 occurrences with an average gain of 2.2%, 30 days after the fact.For ETH, filtering for RSI levels between 47 and 49, showed 43 occurrences since 2017, with an average 30-day gain of 6.7%.Applying those performance figures to current prices, results in prices of $17,144 for bitcoin and $1,291 for ether. This is far from earth-shattering, given where both have traded in the past.The results should not be viewed as predictive but can provide context as to where investors think prices may wind up.If using the historic data for guidance, it’s difficult to find a bullish scenario in the short term. Both price points fall within areas of significant price agreement, decreasing the likelihood of prices pushing higher without an external catalyst.Current data doesn’t offer much either. Both BTC and ETH are both showing declines in volatility because the Average True Range of their price movements has fallen 47% and 46% since November.Their respective Bollinger Bands lend additional credence, as BTC and ETH have stayed closely tethered to their 20-day moving averages, straying from the mean only briefly, before reverting back.As a counterpoint, there isn’t much of a bearish case to be made either.The appetite of asset managers has picked up, adding to their long positions in bitcoin for three consecutive weeks.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Commitment of Traders report is a weekly listing the open interest for futures and options.The most recent release shows that asset managers now account for 40% of long open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and are reportedly 83% long as a group.Derivatives markets show a decline in the ratio of bitcoin put options to call options. One interpretation is that investors see declining opportunities to be profitable by betting against crypto.Ultimately, it likely boils down to investor time horizon.If long-term biased, the current market structure likely provides you with a solid entry point. Shorter-term traders however may be turned off by the lack of price movement.",2022/12/21
58,"Bitcoin looked remarkably stable Wednesday, trading around $16,780 as traders wrestled with the uncertain market outlook for next year.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been moving sideways at the range between $16,700 and $16,900 in the past 24 hours.“Bitcoin isn't getting much of a boost from the positive risk-on environment that is running through Wall Street,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange Oanda, wrote in a Wednesday note.Ether (ETH) followed a similar trajectory, trading flat at $1,210. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was down 0.16%.U.S. equities were a bit more buoyant on Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was recently trading up 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.4%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.4%.Traders have been navigating the continuing nervousness on the potential market contagion from the FTX collapse over the past month and closely watching the U.S. Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance on possibly continuing to raise interest rates in 2023.“The probability of a recession is high,” crypto trader Thomas Kralow previously said in an emailed comment. “People lose their jobs, the Fed pivots too late and we will see the same situation that played out back in 2008. When the Fed pivoted there was a relief rally for S&P 500, but as the interest rates finally started going down the market crashed another 40%.”Kralow pointed out that the markets bottomed when the fed funds rate was basically at zero, adding: “This doesn’t bode well for bitcoin in 2023, and we could potentially see its price fall to $10,000 or even lower next year.”To Alex Tapscott, managing director of the digital asset group at Ninepoint Partners, the current market environment is similar to December 2018 when bitcoin (BTC) hit a then-all-time high in the winter of 2017, and 2018 began “a long period of contraction” in terms of the value among crypto assets.Tapscott told CoinDesk in an interview that the bitcoin drawdown from its all-time high in November 2021 is around 77%, compared to previous bear market lows of 84%, which could suggest further downside.“But we are kind of in that sweet spot where it's starting to look a lot like previous eras,” he said.“You could try and pick a bottom and set yourself up for what I think is going to be a really strong period of growth,"" he added. “But you might not get rewarded for being early because it might retest the same level a couple more times.”",2022/12/21
59,"Recent bankruptcy filings and Sam Bankman-Fried's criminal indictment make it clear that fraud precipitated FTX's collapse. For many policymakers, the loopholes enabling such criminal acts haven't yet become clear. These loopholes permitted flawed – or in FTX’s case, criminal – intermediaries to stand between consumers and their assets. If the U.S. Congress is serious about preventing future catastrophes like FTX, protecting consumers’ inherent right to self-custody clearly mitigates third-party vulnerabilities.Warren Davidson is the U.S. representative for Ohio's 8th congressional district.Just what and who needs legal protection? While Satoshi Nakamoto’s 2008 Bitcoin white paper effectively launched this era of fintech innovation, the legal and regulatory framework today continues to reinforce the structure of our traditional financial system and the legacy flaws that come with it. Fraud is one of these legacy flaws. Fraud committed under the guise of ""innovation"" is still fraud. FTX exemplified this.In short, Bankman-Fried found a way to convince customers and investors to allocate dollars to FTX's platform (or, rather, FTX's balance sheet) by promising to be a third-party intermediary to purchase digital assets on their behalf. Customers then maintained ""balances"" in their FTX accounts while Bankman-Fried put funds under the control of Alameda Research, the trading firm he founded in 2017. He established his own cryptocurrency, FTT, to use as collateral for any loans made from FTX to Alameda. He then leveraged his assets under Alameda's control at unprecedented levels.While this overview spares many details, this is the same criminal approach that has been seen before in traditional finance. FTX customers who transferred their digital assets off FTX's platform and onto their own self-hosted wallets – devices that allow digital assets to be stored off the internet – protected themselves from FTX's fraud. This approach provides the only sound protection against any third-party intermediary’s failure.Read more: Marta Belcher - Elizabeth Warren's New Financial Surveillance Bill Is a Disaster for Privacy and Civil LibertiesFTX leveraged the hype around distributed ledger technology but, ironically, FTX promoted the exact opposite framework that Satoshi proposed. Reading the first two sentences of the Bitcoin white paper highlights this irony: ""Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust-based model."" FTX simply exploited the inherent flaws in the permissioned, third-party financial system Satoshi observed and sought to remedy.Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) recently introduced a bill to build a concrete enclosure around these trust-based models while trapping consumers inside with no way out. Specifically, her bill requires the Treasury Secretary to promulgate a rule prohibiting financial institutions from transacting with self-hosted wallets. She mischaracterizes the FTX situation and claims she's been ""ringing the alarm bell in the Senate on the dangers of these digital asset loopholes.""Let's be clear – her open hostility towards financial freedom is a clear and present danger to consumers and will only reinforce the system fraudsters continue to exploit.That's why I introduced the Keep Your Coins Act last February. It was only a matter of time before someone in Washington, D.C., would try to compel the Treasury Department to interfere with consumers' inherent right to self-custody of their digital assets – to own and possess private property. In the wake of FTX's collapse, it should be evident that protecting self-custody is must-pass legislation.In his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, John J. Ray III, the current FTX CEO overseeing the bankruptcy process, discussed how all of FTX customers' digital assets were commingled. This model left customers with only a ""claim"" over their assets rather than actual possession.We have a technology that allows consumers to avoid third-party vulnerabilities. It's imperative to embrace this opportunity to protect consumers. FTX was not about crypto; it was about a criminal exploiting a traditional third-party relationship by failing to do what he said he was doing – establishing a property right to digital assets on behalf of customers who deposited funds with his company. Self-custody has proved the only foil to his scheme, and Congress should protect it rather than undermine it with Senator Warren’s disingenuous assault on financial freedom.",2022/12/21

61,"Bitcoiner and podcaster Peter McCormack should pay Craig Wright, the Australian scientist who claims to be Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, around 900,000 British pounds (US$1.1 million) in costs following their legal battle, U.K. High Court Judge Martin Chamberlain has ruled.Wright had argued that McCormack should pay the majority of costs for the legal proceedings, but accepted paying all McCormack's costs save for those ruled in Wright's favor.The costs ruled in Wright's favor relate to an earlier judgment from October last year, finding that McCormack could not prove that he was telling the truth when he labeled the Wright a fraud.The two men's legal battle emanated from a 2019 discussion – subsequently broadcast on YouTube – in which McCormack called Wright a liar and a fraud and said he ""is not Satoshi."" Wright claimed that such comments caused him financial damage after he was disinvited to speak at various events and conferences.The judge concluded in August that Wright had advanced false evidence in his claim, and therefore awarded him only nominal damages of one pound ($1.23). In his final judgment, Chamberlain refused Wright's permission to appeal this decision.The judge also did not grant Wright's request for an injunction to be made against McCormack repeating these claims.Craig Wright has been involved in a string of legal battles surrounding his claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, of whom nobody knows the true identity.

62,"Financial institutions are starting to realize they should have been embracing decentralized finance (DeFi) all along. By the end of 2023 the largest DeFi ecosystems will be the most demonstrably decentralized ones.Although decentralization is the bedrock on which all blockchain technologies are built, it is hardly a guarantee across crypto. The recent boom-bust market cycle was marked by the rise of two competing approaches among crypto finance ventures: censorship-resistance versus speed.Kevin Mehrabi is the CEO of Wealthchain. This article is part of Crypto 2023.In recent years, the few financial institutions brave enough to enter crypto have generally preferred centralized entities to invest in. These are firms that offered the veneer of transparency and were run by people with reputations to lose.In 2023, after the disastrous reckoning across the crypto industry, we will finally see their massive shift of institutional interest towards genuinely trustless protocols.The decentralization-first crowd begins their platforms on a smart-contract level – deploying permissionless applications onto a blockchain. Although protocols like Compound, Aave and Uniswap have development entities, they are protocols first and foremost. They eschew custodial wallets and off-chain collateral, ensuring that the flow of funds is observable on a public block record.See also: Adoption of DeFi, ZK Tech, NFTs and More Will Continue to Increase in 2023Decentralization advocates view centralized ventures as everything wrong with traditional finance. Of course, layering centralization across blockchains would lead to the same problems that inspired Satoshi Nakamoto to build Bitcoin. DeFi in its truest sense is the completion of this decentralization-first purist approach.Centralization-first industrialists have historically paid lip service to crypto’s main tenets of openness, verifiability and irreversibility all while saying central intermediaries would have to come into play at some point. They dismissed the decentralization-first approach as unsustainable idealism from tone-deaf techie folk. And, truth enough, FTX, Celsius Network, Nexo, BlockFi and Voyager Digital did scale rapidly. But greater speed and more feature capability comes with risks.The events of 2022 demonstrated that centralization-first approaches to crypto finance present the greater risk. Indeed, the unmonitored control of off-chain capital by FTX and Celsius enabled the misdeeds and bad trades that led to their catastrophic collapse. Meanwhile, the transparency and security of the decentralization-first set including Aave, Compound, Sushi and dYdX have left those DeFi platforms virtually unscathed. In fact, Uniswap recently surpassed Coinbase in trading volume for the first time to become the world’s second-largest exchange.Critics will point to historical DeFi hacks as evidence that DeFi is not as secure as decentralization-first purists would describe. However, those exploits are not indicative of the whole. Rather, many exploits this year were due to the rush of untested platforms released into the wild, and security auditors being overwhelmed by demand that outpaced their ability to maintain quality. When built, reviewed and governed properly, DeFi platforms can be as secure as the blockchains on which they were deployed.Likewise, the degree of decentralization among the underlying blockchains themselves will become a subject of increasing importance to DeFi in 2023. Poorly decentralized blockchain governance can and has led to contentious hard forks in which the blockchain community, network and most importantly every digital asset issued on that chain suffer a “split.”Without decentralized governance, dissent can only lead to division. The outcomes of these events are unpredictable: Each respective faction claims to be the authentic continuance of the previously united chain. One faction could rally the network and become dominant – but that dominance can change over time. The uncertainty itself is the problem.Asset-split risk is an underdiscussed problem for DeFi – with potentially calamitous repercussions. Ethereum saw a contentious chain split after its recent hard fork (the Merge), for which JPMorgan expressed concerns a rival proof-of-work-run Ethereum could cause market confusion and split the network. That didn’t happen this time, but that’s because nearly everyone building on Ethereum supported an upgrade to proof-of-stake – not every decision will be as black and white going forward.See also: Where Is the Ethereum Virtual Machine Headed in 2023? (Hint: Beyond Ethereum)Imagine if Tether’s USDT reserves suddenly had to collateralize assets for not just one set of tokens on Ethereum but two after a contentious chain split. For financial institutions evaluating the prospect of tokenizing trillions of dollars in capital and quadrillions of dollars in derivatives, even a low prospect for asset-splitting becomes untenable.So, how will financial institutions embrace DeFi while minimizing asset-split risk? The simple solution is through diversification to many different DeFi ecosystems. “The future is multi-chain,” after all. An additional safeguard is to engage with DeFi ecosystems on blockchains that are the least likely to suffer asset splits – that is, blockchains with the most decentralized forms of governance.How can blockchain protocol governance be decentralized? Blockchains such as Algorand enable validators to vote on upgrade proposals. Tezos, a network I have a stake in seeing succeed, put as many governance decisions on-chain. Thus far, Tezos has had 12 successful upgrades since its 2018 launch, with all contentions resolved on-chain.As financial institutions increasingly engage DeFi over the course of 2023, the scope of standards for decentralization will extend to governance at all levels. It would behoove DeFi platforms and the blockchain communities on which they are built to take heed.",2022/12/21
63,"We have recently been reminded that markets, as heavily as we rely on them, are far from ideal in practice. For one thing, settlement risk of major equities markets is increasingly capable of taking down the global economy. This is because of the growing number of traders occasionally using social media to in effect collude, such as with GameStop.For another, cryptocurrency marketplaces such as FTX have caused huge losses to users because of the lack of full custody coverage. These issues stem from the way current electronic markets were simply designed as copies of open outcry and paper-based markets – and, also, ironically, from the fact that all the major crypto markets were built in an unprecedentedly centralized manner.Even a commitment to full coverage is, of course, not enough to address custody risk – those running an exchange can easily abscond with its assets. And even if both settlement and custody risk are solved, information asymmetry remains a problem. Access to tremendously valuable information about trades and traders is available exclusively to those who operate all types of markets today. Somewhat akin to consumer data in Web2 versus Web3, this data has huge potential for a variety of clandestine market manipulations. There is currently no way to prove the negative, that such information is not being exploited to the detriment of traders and markets overall.David Chaum, a pioneer in cryptography and in privacy preserving and secure voting technologies, is the creator and founder of the xx network. In 1995 his company, DigiCash, created and deployed eCash, the first digital currency, which used Chaum's breakthrough blind-signature protocol. This essay is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.A market mechanism I’ll introduce below solves these problems. It has no custody risk or settlement risk, and trader information is available only to the respective traders themselves.The underlying type of market here is generally referred to as a “call market.” Such periodic auction markets are, for instance, used today in Nasdaq’s opening and closing periods. Traders place what should be sealed transaction requests during these trading periods. Only after the period ends are the requests, in effect, unsealed, a single price calculated from the requests and the trades that should clear at that price consummated.To keep trader information from the exchange operator in the solution here, the market clearing price is calculated by a so-called multiparty computation (MPC). This term was coined by me to describe what are now increasingly often-deployed cryptographic techniques. These allow multiple encrypted inputs to be converted to a cleartext output by an agreed algorithm. The “computation” is in effect performed by the cryptographic protocol itself such that no party can decrypt the encrypted inputs posted, but all parties can be certain that the cleartext output was computed correctly from exactly those inputs.Although most equities and traditional commodities today are not primarily represented on blockchains, a few are, such as by the Swiss exchange Sixth. In this system, however, to address settlement and custody risk all assets traded are held on blockchains. For instance, when the pair being traded is bitcoin against dollars, bitcoin is, of course, already on a blockchain and dollars would be on a dollar stablecoin blockchain. As part of the process of submitting a bid or ask, the asset is transferred to a wallet on the native blockchain of that asset. But such wallets are created to be under joint custody of the exchange and the trader – so-called “multisig” wallets. Their value can only be transferred out by cooperation of those two entities.Read more: 10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023Once the multiparty computation reveals the market clearing price as mentioned above, some of the multisig wallets will trade and the rest will be refunded. Bids above the clearing price, as well as asks below the clearing price, trade at the clearing price in a typical call market; non-traded bids and asks result in the assets in the associated multisig wallet being refunded to the trader who placed them there. Such refunds are easy to achieve: The exchange operator simply reveals its keys for all multisigs for which a zero-knowledge proof, provided by a given trader, shows that the particular price that was cryptographically committed to by that trader does not make the cutoff. (To ensure that the numbers of buyers and sellers that will trade are equal, different cutoffs can be provided for buy- and sell-side.) The keys issued by the exchange are useless to anyone except the trader in question, who then uses them to regain control of the asset they committed.A simple way to accomplish the swap of those assets remaining locked in the multisig wallets is based on fixed lots on one side of the asset pair: for instance, one bitcoin against a variable number of dollars. (Larger trades could be made more efficient by multiple parallel markets, each for fixed lots such as two, four, eight and 16 bitcoin, but using the same clearing price; however, I’ll ignore this elaboration in what follows.) An amount of value initially moved to the multisig wallets on the variable-amount side by traders functions as a minimum “commitment fee.” Once the clearing price is established by MPC, traders on the variable-amount side transfer additional value to their respective multisig wallets so as to fund the exact amount required by the swap.Finally, the MPC randomly pairs off all remaining counterparties, each pair comprising one trader on the bid side and one on the ask side. This then allows each pair to bilaterally complete an “atomic swap” protocol, in which settlement occurs directly as part of the trade. Such a swap is the only way the parties can unlock the value they placed in the multisig wallet. As I noted earlier, it results in the party on one side of the trade taking custody of what was the multisig wallet of their counterparty on the other side of the trade. What I’ve called “Liquifinity” is an atomic-swap technology that cryptographically secures against either party walking away before they give their counterparty the keys for the multisig to be transferred and thereby complete the swap. So parties that placed a bid for a price above the clearing price consummate a trade with randomly-selected counterparties that committed to an ask below the clearing price. No third party ever has custody, meaning no custody risk. And the trade is “atomic” – settlement coincident with the trade – meaning no settlement risk.See also: Crypto 2023: It's Sanctions Season | OpinionIf, however, those operating the exchange could learn who is associated with specific bids or asks, this information could allow them to manipulate the market, such as by learning the approximate positions and trading patterns of participants. To solve this, what I’ve called “mixing” is used for all communication between traders and the exchange. Mixing conceals who is sending or receiving which message. Moreover, trader identities should not be associated with wallet IDs of the underlying assets being traded. Unlinking, in this way, any persistent user identity from trades hides who is behind transactions, which can be a useful source of information to anyone aiming to manipulate a market.Collusion between an exchange and traders, or even potential extortion of traders by an exchange, however unthinkable in many settings, can be ensured against by a bond posted by the exchange. The bond need only be sufficient for the exposure of a single round of a call market, because such abuse would come to light before a next round. This makes the maximum backing of such exchanges extremely practical. It is in sharp contrast to what would be impractical bonding requirements for typical settlement or even for exchange arrangements with extended periods over which risks can accumulate.This is a fully generalizable way to realize a market for pairs of assets. It includes a solution to both custody and settlement risk. And it obviates manipulation through information asymmetry by ensuring that all details remain private to traders. It is immediately applicable to crypto markets, where the need is most urgent and acutely felt. Once deployed, it will demonstrate that traditional markets can benefit significantly from adopting such best practices from crypto.",2022/12/21
64,"“Quantity has a quality all its own.”—Thomas A. Callaghan Jr.Although the ethical and legal dimensions of the FTX meltdown will be subject to ongoing debate, this much is clear in the wake of the biggest value destruction event in the history of our industry. CeFi, or centralized finance, is fatally flawed and no longer has a defensible value proposition to stand on. Exchanges have already seen the retail sector slip out of reach due to simple unit economics. Amid the bull rush, Super Bowl commercials and namesake stadiums pushed CAC/LTV ratios [lifetime value divided by the customer acquisition cost] beyond the realm of reality. And then when the market tanked in May, the not-all-that-large-to-begin-with pool of retail interest dried up abruptly, to the point that taking it on the chin became the default expectation for the family Thanksgiving dinner.And now, after Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison, there will be no good reason for large, well-run banks to use CeFi exchanges either. Whether the former heads of FTX and Alameda Research were guilty of criminal greed or just incredulous levels of stupidity is irrelevant. CeFi will head off into the sunset, as it deservedly should. “Disintermediation as a service” is prone to corruption and waste. It’s a bad premise on which to build a business, let alone a category.Mike Maizels is the former head of research at Abra. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.As such, the next logical step for the industry is to turn its attention to where cryptocurrency potentials collide with the needs and frictions of legacy financial institutions. Decentralized finance (DeFi) may represent the financial “pipes” of the future, but it is the old world of traditional finance (TradFi) that still holds all the water. To date, adoption has been hindered by regulatory uncertainty, market volatility and the risks inherent in diving in to provable digital scarcity as an early entrant. But lying behind these immediate roadblocks, the way forward becomes somehow even less clear. Perhaps the most fundamental issue of all is sheer size. Consider the just market for foreign currency. JPMorgan settles forex trades with the combined value of the entire cryptocurrency sector every day.Blockchain technology has much value to bring to this market, particularly through the novel capabilities of stablecoins. Their potential for instant settlement and close-to-zero marginal costs – which could unlock dramatically lower foreign exchange (FX) rates – is tantalizingly real, but the infrastructure needed to support adoption at scale is critically missing.Scale matters because almost all present-day crypto settlement products were built under retail-sized premises. Namely, low marginal cost settlement has been made possible by the remarkable maturation of “automated market makers,” also known as AMMs. AMMs perform the work of legacy trading firms and banks, offering liquidity in the form of standings offers to buy and sell assets at specified prices – all without human intervention.The ability to do so without human input lies in an elegant use of simple mathematical principles to maintain balance in liquidity pools. Two assets, X and Y, are held in a pool, with the product of their cumulative values linked to some constant. For the purposes of a simple explanation, assume the assets are equivalent to each other in price. 100 X units and 100 Y units makes a pool constant of 10,000. Now imagine a trader wants to acquire 10 units of Y. That would leave 90 in the pool, a deficit of 11.1 X units (10,000/90 = 111.1). This becomes the price (plus a small fee) paid by the trader for her new 10 units of Y. Note that 10 units of Y for 11.1 units of X represents an 11.1% premium over the abstract, 1:1 price parity under which the pool was established.Read more: Preventing Crypto Exploits & Hacks in 2023 | OpinionImportantly, this slippage grows exponentially as the trade size approaches the limits of the pool depth. Imagine if the trader wanted to acquire 99 units of Y. The price paid would be 9,900 units of X, a premium of just under 1 million percent. In practice, these unit economics limit the institutional utility of even the largest DeFi pools – Uniswap currently supports a daily trading volume less than a tenth of a percent of JPMorgan’s foreign exchange business.Owing to such limitations, large institutions wishing to transact at scale have had no real choice other than to use custodial CeFi exchanges like FTX. Custodial here is key to the potential for abuse. Unlike traditional FX desks, which operate as deal-brokers but would rarely take custody of liquid assets, cryptocurrency exchanges take possession of the tokens in order to execute orders directly. This model, akin to permitting a real estate agent to move into your house and take possession of your deed as a precondition of sale, prepares the ground for disaster. Not only can exchanges front-run trades, profiting at the expense of clients, but the lack of deep liquidity makes it necessary to advertise large limit orders in a public manner. These limit orders may be anonymized to an extent, but even public awareness of the existence of large orders skews market intelligence to the detriment of all who seek to participate.Builders are hard at work creating solutions for this blockage across a spectrum of time horizons. In the most immediate term, regulated cryptocurrency service providers are beginning to stand up over-the-counter (OTC) desks along the models of currency exchanges of yesteryear – working the phones on behalf of clients rather than taking custody of their assets in order to execute trades on their behalf. This will no doubt drive value; it is a matter of seconds to move stablecoins on a blockchain rather than days to settle fiat exchange through SWIFT.See also: The Best Bitcoin Lightning Payment Solutions | OpinionHowever, the use of human brokers foregoes the signature advantage of DeFi: trustless, automated functioning. Uber would be a remarkably less-efficient company if human switchboard operators were required to match riders to drivers. Tech-driven systems such as on-chain order books suffer from the converse problem. Their trustless nature necessitates a publicly visible set of trading positions, a flaw akin to poker players betting with cards displayed to all of their opponents.However, a bottom-up approach to new tools to connect AMMs and to expand the kinds of instruments that they support (e.g., options with an expiration date) has the potential to push back the horizons of the possible. These topics have received important theoretical treatment by Dr. Maurice Herlihy, An Wang professor of computer science at Brown University, who has demonstrated that AMMs may be considered like electrical circuits. Properly constructed, they can operate either in series (trade asset A for B on one AMM, and B for C on another) or in parallel (split a large trade between A for B between multiple AMMs), arrangements that may be considered as mathematically equivalent to one larger AMM. Significantly, these different configurations can redistribute the costs of participating between traders (slippages, as described above) and capital providers (the much rehearsed impermanent loss). Such costs can never be fully eliminated, but they can be subjected both to rational minimization and strategic hedging (e.g., a synthetic “impermanent gain” token that offers insurance for impermanent loss).The analogy with the electrical circuit is extremely important. The modern discovery of electromagnetic phenomena occurred in the late 18th century, and it took decades for the rules governing their operation to be formulated mathematically. It took several additional decades for the discipline of “electrical engineering” to emerge, which sought to harness the principles of electricity to perform socially useful functions. The first product, the telegraph, enabled only the exchange of direct messages, akin to the first permissionless, peer-to-peer payments on the Bitcoin ledger. The modern electrical infrastructure required numerous other independent inventions to come online together – the dynamo for generation, the battery for storage, the resistor and capacitor for modulation. But soon, these and other devices permitted not just inventors, but entrepreneurs to create technological marvels that transformed the fabric of the world.Read more: 2023 Will Be the Year of Dapps – Here's What to Expect | OpinionThe cryptocurrency sector is fond of the analogy of “speed running the history of finance,” but we are also reprising the development of many other infrastructure-level technologies. From an electrical perspective, we are perhaps now in the 1860s. We have elaborated the circuitry of DeFi, and must now realize its potential to replace the oil lamps, hand cranks and steam engines of the present financial landscapes. Wiring AMMs together will require huge complementary efforts: rethinking security procedures and value capture through transaction ordering, a topic animating the widespread interest in grappling with maximum extractable value (MEV).The history of electricity has one other valuable lesson to teach us. While the mythos emphasizes independent inventors with their lightbulb moments, the reality was that the path from idea to impact was blazed by new modes of collaboration between institutions of higher learning and the world outside their walls. Prior to the 19th century, colleges and universities saw themselves as space apart – zones of aristocratic privilege or monastic scholarship in which inquiry was prized for its own right and disparaged if it became tinged with social or commercial usefulness. That began to change in Germany and the U.S., with emergent departments of electrical engineering often leading the charge to carry out research designed for commercial or civil application. In all likelihood, the present crisis in graduate education, with soaring tuition costs and vanishing opportunities for “pure” academic positions, represents another epoch-defining shift. It will be to the great benefit of the cryptocurrency sector to find ways to capitalize.With thanks to Robin Malik for his contributions.",2022/12/21
65,"Ethereum merged, decentralized finance (DeFi) imploded, FTX crashed and burned. Bitcoin, in the meantime, continued to build, said the Bitcoin Operations Technology Group (Optech) – a community of Bitcoin contributors – in its annual year-end review.The paper covers dozens of milestones: from ambitious scaling proposals such as validity rollups and the Taro test software, to captivating events like the establishment of a Bitcoin legal defense fund by Block CEO Jack Dorsey and a controversial Lightning Network Daemon (LND) bug that left part of the Lightning Network in disarray.Amid these developments, Optech highlighted three major themes that sparked both vigorous debate and vigorous coding: replace-by-fee, or RBF (a way to replace unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions), several soft fork proposals and 16 major Bitcoin ecosystem software releases.Taro, a new piece of software (currently under early testing) that will allow Bitcoin developers to create, send and receive assets on the Bitcoin blockchain (think stablecoins on Bitcoin), may be the most interesting of the milestones.Read more: Lightning Labs Releases Software to Allow Bitcoin Developers to Mint and Transfer Assets on the BlockchainOthers include validity rollups first floated by Bitcoin researcher John Light. A validity rollup would combine large numbers of transactions off-chain, validate those transactions, then submit the validated batch as a single “rolled up” transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain.Chaos broke out in November when Twitter user “Burak” (@brqgoo) exploited a bug that took down a large swath of the Lightning Network, raising questions about how the Bitcoin community should handle similar vulnerabilities in the future.Finally, Jack Dorsey, together with Alex Morcos and Martin White, established the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund. Dorsey announced the fund on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list, describing it as “a nonprofit entity that aims to minimize legal headaches that discourage software developers from actively developing Bitcoin and related projects.”Read more: Bitcoin After the Ethereum Merge: Experts Weigh InOne topic that seemed to polarize Bitcoiners all year long was the debate over Replace-By-Fee (RBF), a feature in Bitcoin Core that gives users the option to replace unconfirmed transactions with new transactions, as long as they’re willing to pay a higher fee for the replacement transaction. (Bitcoin Core is the dominant software used to connect to the Bitcoin network.)Why would anyone want to replace an unconfirmed transaction? Imagine Bob desperately needs to send one bitcoin (BTC) to Alice during a period of peak transaction volume (say, during a surge in Binance withdrawals). Bitcoin transactions are typically confirmed – accepted into a block of transactions that gets added to the Bitcoin blockchain – every 10 minutes or so. It’s been over 30 minutes and three blocks have already been confirmed, but because the network is at peak volume, no miner has accepted Bob’s transaction because other transactions are paying miners much higher fees. (Bitcoin miners process transactions and secure the network.)Bob’s unconfirmed transaction is officially “stuck.” With RBF, Bob can replace his original transaction and pay a higher fee to get it accepted by a miner.There are two main flavors of RBF. Opt-in RBF allows Bob to mark or “flag” his unconfirmed transactions as replaceable or not replaceable. Full RBF simply makes all unconfirmed transactions replaceable.Here’s where the controversy lies. According to some Bitcoin business owners, certain vendors are willing to accept riskier unconfirmed transactions because they deal with low value goods and services. Those vendors have strategically optimized their operations to minimize the risk from these zero confirmation (unconfirmed) transactions. The catch, though, is that optimization is only based on opt-in RBF and not full RBF.Other bitcoiners argue zero-confirmation fraud is a risk independent of RBF. Whatever the case may be, full RBF (menu option “mempoolfullrbf”) was introduced in Bitcoin Core version 24.0 last month. However, it’s switched off by default, meaning node operators running the Bitcoin Core software must proactively switch it on if they want to make all transactions replaceable.Soft forks are upgrades to a blockchain that are backwards-compatible. Nodes (computers on the Bitcoin network) that don’t upgrade still view the upgraded chain as valid (all nodes are still one big happy family).Conversely, hard forks result in a permanent change to the blockchain that isn’t backwards-compatible (nodes either accept the change or split off onto a separate blockchain).Bitcoin developers prefer adding new features to Bitcoin via soft forks rather than hard forks (unlike Ethereum developers).According to Optech, there was significant interest in soft fork proposals, especially around CheckTemplateVerify (CTV), a proposal by developer Jeremy Rubin, and AnyPrevOut (APO), a proposal by developers Christian Decker and Anthony Towns.CTV allows Bitcoin users to restrict or specify how their coins are spent, a concept known as a covenant. For example, a sender can use CTV to create a bitcoin cold storage vault that automatically releases a small amount of bitcoin to an assigned hot wallet on a scheduled basis (Rubin calls them structured liquidity vaults).APO is a proposal for a new type of public key that allows certain adjustments to a transaction even after it’s signed. This could be applicable for use cases like Eltoo, a proposed enhancement to the Lightning Network (Bitcoin’s layer 2 scaling system).Many of these proposals were discussed and updated but haven’t been implemented. Vibrant discussions are continuing.It was a busy year for Bitcoin builders. Optech lists 16 major software releases in 2022 from 8 Bitcoin ecosystem projects:Of all these releases, Bitcoin Core version 24.0, which introduced full RBF, may have been the most impactful, or at least the most talked about.",2022/12/21

69,"Core Scientific (CORZ), one of the largest bitcoin (BTC) miners by computing power, filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday and reached a deal with some of its lenders to restructure its debt.The company filed for Chapter 11 at Southern District of Texas bankruptcy court as crypto winter continues to take its toll on the industry. The miner's estimated liabilities are between $1 billion-$10 billion, according to the filing. It has around 1,000-5,000 creditors, with the largest unsecured claim coming from investment bank B. Riley.The miner's estimated assets are between $1 billion-$10 billion, according to the filing. At the end of the third quarter, Core Scientific's assets stood at $1.4 billion, whereas its liabilities were about $1.3 billion, according to its earnings report.The bankruptcy of Core Scientific, which accounts for about 10% of computing power on the bitcoin network, operating 143,000 mining rigs and hosting another 100,000 is the biggest one yet and is set to send shockwaves in an already crumbling industry.Core Scientific reached an agreement with some of its creditors, in what appears to be a prepackaged bankruptcy. In a prepackaged bankruptcy, the debtor reaches some sort of agreement with its debtee before officially filling for bankruptcy.The miner expects support from some of its convertible noteholders in the form of two debtor-in-possession (DIP) facilities, totaling up to $75 million, Core Scientific said in a press release. This support will help it go through the bankruptcy process, which it intends to do ""swiftly,"" the press release said. The miner had $544 million in convertible notes outstanding at the end of the third quarter.Existing convertible note holders will ""equitize their debt into a significant majority of the common stock of the reorganized company,"" the mining firm said. Other holders of general unsecured claims and existing common shareholders will also ""receive meaningful recoveries in the form of reorganized common stock and warrants"" under the restructuring deal.The company first warned of the risk of bankruptcy in late October, and said it wouldn't be paying some of its loan installments, sending its shares plummeting about 80% on Nasdaq. In November, it reiterated that it may run out of money by the end of this year.Last week, investment bank B. Riley proposed a $72 million financing plan, including $40 million of financing ""immediately"" and with ""zero contingencies."" However, the rest of the funding would be made available once bitcoin hit $18,500. Core Scientific has $42 million outstanding to the bank.Instead, Core Scientific expects to seal a deal with a group representing ""more than 50% of the holders of its convertible notes"" that will grant it $56 million in a DIP facility. The noteholders have agreed to syndicate up to ""$19 million in new money DIP Facility loans to all holders of convertible notes,"" the Wednesday press release said.""These funds, along with ongoing cash generated from operations, are anticipated to provide the necessary financing to effectuate the planned restructuring, facilitate the emergence from Chapter 11, and cover the fees and expenses of legal and financial advisors,"" the miner said.Core Scientific's operations ""remain significantly cash flow positive on a debt-free basis,"" the press release said.Core Scientific is one of several miners struggling to keep afloat as rising energy prices increase costs, while stubbornly low bitcoin prices slash revenue. Compute North, another major firm in the space, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September.Iris Energy (IREN) had to unplug about 72% of its computing power that was tied to just over $100 million of loans that it defaulted on. The loans were held by special-purpose non-recourse vehicles. In November, Argo Blockchain's (ARBK) deal to sell $27 million of equity to fund operations fell through and the company was subsequently downgraded by two analysts. Greenidge Generation (GREE) on Tuesday announced a debt restructuring deal with its lender NYDIG, but could still run out of cash in two months if it doesn't secure additional funding.Core Scientific has also been affected by the bankruptcy of lender Celsius Network's mining arm, one of its biggest clients, and lender BlockFi, to which it owes $54 million. Celsius Mining filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July and in September sued Core Scientific, claiming that it violated automatic stay terms. Core Scientific claims Celsius owes it $5.2 million as of Sept. 30. BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late November, one of many victims of crypto exchange FTX's implosion.Core Scientific was running 243,000 machines in its facilities as of the end of October, split between 14.4 exahash per second (EH/s) of bitcoin self-mining hashrate, and 10 EH/s of hosted machines for other firms, according to the filing.

""We think investors’ willingness to accumulate altcoins has been severely impacted by the deleveraging in 2022 and may take many months to fully recuperate.""BitDAO’s $100M token buyback proposal spurs community concernsBy Shaurya MalwaCommunity members of BitDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on driving adoption of its native BIT token ecosystem, this week proposed to set its Target Daily Purchase Amount (TDPA) at 2 million tether (USDT) per day for 50 days starting Jan. 1, 2023.The purchase amounts to a total purchase of 100 million USDT of BIT. BitDAO is styled as an open platform for proposals that are voted on by BIT token holders, and is agnostic to chains and projects, as per technical documents.According to the proposal, the recommended priorities for BitDAO capital deployment include high priority for BIT-related products and low priority for swaps and investments, as well as yield strategies.The DAO's treasury currently holds 300 million in USDT and USD coin (USDC), and 270,000 ether (ETH), valued at approximately $345 million, which is expected to be sufficient to cover at least five years of BIT product development.BitDAO community members said that the original strategy for the collective was to grow the treasury via direct investments and the creation of BitDAO-like entities (sub-DAO/autonomous entities) and investments.However, that strategy had a “questionable impact” on driving outcomes for BIT. “The most performant DAOs (Lido, Aave, Uni) have been centered on underlying core products that have large addressable markets and longevity,” the proposal stated, calling for higher priorities on “core products” related to BitDAO instead.One such core product is the upcoming Ethereum layer 2 network Mantle, the proposal said. The initial development of Mantle has been bootstrapped by Bybit, one of BitDAO’s key backers, with the next phase being a DAO proposal and budget cycles for expanded development and go-to-market activities.The proposal also recommended against pursuing complex financial derivatives such as swaps and investments that do not have strategic outcomes for BIT. The lack of flexibility for DAOs to negotiate competitive deals and limited options for post-investment legal and governance involvement once funds have been transferred were listed as key reasons for such a dissuasive move.Additionally, the proposal advised against participating in yield strategies due to the high systemic risk in the crypto market and the difficulty in calculating fair prices and slippage for altcoins. The risks associated with capital deployment and liquidity constraints when unwinding positions are also cited as reasons for caution.Responses on the currently live proposal remained mixed as of Wednesday morning.“It is not a good idea to buyback at this price level,” one community member said, citing BIT’s token prices remaining above the net asset value of a basket of underlying ether, USDT and USDC.“I’m afraid I have to disagree,” another poster said. “We should constantly buy back and burn. BIT tokens still don’t have demand, if we don’t buy back and burn BIT tokens will go to zero. Buyback and burn at least 2024 because every month 180 million tokens will release (sic).”Some community members pointed out crypto exchange Bybit’s upcoming token incentive program as a cause for concern. “I have reservations about this repurchase,” wrote one member. “Bybit is about to issue a year-end bonus of 92 million BIT. At this time, BitDAO proposed to repurchase it, giving people the feeling that the treasury will pay for the year-end bonus.”3:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:00 UTC) Germany Gfk Consumer Confidence Survey (Jan)9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Bank of Canada Consumer Price Index Core (YoY/Nov) 11:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(15:00 UTC) United States Consumer Confidence (Dec)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:FTX Developments; Who Moved 100 Bitcoins Tied to Defunct Crypto Exchange QuadrigaCX?""First Mover"" dived into the mystery of the sudden movement of 100 BTC tied to the bankrupt Canadian crypto exchange, QuadrigaCX.

74,"Shortly after the ball dropped in Times Square on New Year's Eve welcoming in 2022, the cryptocurrency, blockchain and digital assets community rang in the new year with thoughts of mass adoption into the mainstream. Bitcoin was trading around $40,000, an iconic arena in Los Angeles had just changed its name to one of the major crypto exchanges, and celebrities, athletes and musicians were lining up to sing the praises of this new financial ecosystem.Bill Callahan, a former special agent financial investigator with the U.S. Department of Justice, is the director of government and strategic affairs at the Blockchain Intelligence Group. This article is part of Crypto 2023.It’s been a bumpy ride since then. Bitcoin is down 60%. Once-prominent crypto apps Celsius Network and BlockFi are sitting in bankruptcy court. And as we head into the new year, at least one stadium will have to scrub a crypto exchange’s name off its facade.Law enforcement, financial investigators and anti-money laundering examiners have had their hands full with digital asset-related scams, frauds, thefts and hacks this year. And we’re not just talking about stolen Bored Apes (though more than a few were phished). If we learned anything in 2022, it’s that blockchain analytics can help speed up an investigation – from the time law enforcement is first alerted to a potential financial crime to the time of arrest.In March, my company, Blockchain Intelligence Group, uncovered potential suspicious activity involving a non-fungible token (NFT) project called Frosties and notified law enforcement authorities. Agents were able to track and trace financial transactions along the blockchain and along with other electronic data, were able to identify the culprits, arrest them and prevent another planned NFT fraud.See also: Crypto 2023: It's Sanctions SeasonWhat ordinarily would have taken months of painstaking financial investigative work was reduced to a matter of weeks. That’s important, considering the number and value of crypto exploits actually increased this year – despite the market pull back.In 2023, the need for blockchain investigators (and analytics tools) will grow: from global regulatory agencies handling complex investigations of cyber-attacks and the cross-jurisdictional movement of money to local police agencies responding to citizen complaints of romance or investment scams.Local police departments will no longer have the luxury to send these investigations to the feds but will dedicate resources to train and equip financial and economic crime detectives with the latest in cryptocurrency investigation education.In 2023, crypto service providers will need to learn more about the trans-national criminal organization (TCO) and drug trafficking organizations (DTO), to use the parlance of investigators. It’s every ecosystem participant’s duty to file suspicious activity reports and stay aware of potential crimes.Just as during the rise of the modern drug cartel in 1980s and 1990s, specific players have emerged with new technologies to service and support bad actors. Crypto, with its unprecedented level of transparency, should make it difficult for dark flows of cash – though that doesn’t always happen.Although crypto is verifiable, transnational criminal syndicates benefit from the censorship resistance of decentralized networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum (and maybe a handful of others) to consolidate their earnings from illicit activity.See also: 10 Predictions About Crypto in 2023Then there’s the rise of crime-as-a-service, such as providing a crypto for fiat or vice versa exchange, code and instructions to conduct a hack or a wallet service to collect crypto from a phishing scam. Actors have and will continue to emerge to segregate these duties from each other.Blockchain analysis can help track flows from criminal activity, but it’s only part of a potential solution. Education on how to avoid being a victim of cryptocurrency fraud needs to increase in 2023. That will start with communities revolting against the proliferation of bitcoin ATM machines in places where you traditionally would not do your banking or investing (i.e., bars, gas stations and the back of a convenience store) – which have emerged as potential money laundering jukeboxes.While the criminal element will continue their attacks, the cybersecurity industry will strengthen. Blockchain and cryptocurrency analytics will be incorporated into the response. The digital asset investigations space will continue to grow, tools to track and trace cryptocurrency scams and frauds will become more affordable and readily available to local police agencies and financial investigators will not just follow the money, they will follow the coins.",2022/12/20
75,"Money is searching for quality in both traditional and digital assets, as investors appear to favor safety above all for right now.CoinDesk Indices (CDI) data shows the Currency Select Index (CCYS), anchored by bitcoin (BTC), and the Smart Contract Platform Index (SCPX), anchored by ether (ETH), outperforming other select sectors within the CMI universe.CMI sectors represent comprehensive groupings of digital assets by sector, allowing for measurement of performance and a comparison.What today’s data shows is that, similar to in past market cycles, flights to safety within the cryptosphere is translating to movement of capital into BTC and ETH, relative to other coins.On the other end of the spectrum, the more speculative Computing Index (CPU) and Culture & Entertainment (CNE) have lagged other sectors in both week to date and month to date performance.The rotation of capital from perceived risk to perceived safety in crypto markets is occurring in conjunction with similar flows within traditional finance.Relative Rotation Graphs (RRG), a tool developed by Julius de Kempanaer, allows for assets to be tracked versus a selected benchmark. Assets are subsequently separated into four distinct quadrants.We compared the following seven SPDR exchange-traded funds (ETF) using the S&P 500 as the benchmark.Defensive sectors such as consumer staples, health care and utilities lead the S&P 500 currently. The more speculative consumer discretionary and technology sectors are lagging and weakening versus the benchmark.The similar behavior among investors in the two asset classes implies that everyone is choosing safety at the moment.For those who prefer traditional equities, that translates to utilities, health care and consumer staples. For those who prefer traditional assets, the assets of choice are bitcoin and ether.Interestingly, adding bitcoin and ether to the same RRG shows that they both fall into the leading quadrant as well.This appears counterintuitive, as you would be hard-pressed to find someone who would place cryptocurrencies within the same risk bucket as health-care stocks.But the landscape of markets is ever-changing. And in today’s environment, investors looking for safety in both crypto and traditional equities have landed within the same area.",2022/12/20
76,"The CoinDesk Currency Index Ex Stablecoin (CCX) is designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of constituents in the CoinDesk Currency Index excluding stablecoins. CCX reflects the DACS as of the prior month, so the Currency sector refers to any digital asset acting primarily as a medium of exchange and unit of account running on a blockchain network with the ability to complete cross-border transactions without restriction. Digital assets in the Currency sector do not necessarily act as a store of value[1].As of Dec 15, 2022, CCX lost 10.3% for the quarter to date (QTD), and included 25 digital assets assigned to seven industries in three industry groups according to the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS).Read more: CoinDesk Market Outlook: 4Q Crypto Gloom Spills Into 2023The Currency Sector’s fourth quarter filled investors with thrills and worries alike: On-again, off-again tokens such as dogecoin (DOGE) and litecoin (LTC) performed well, even as bellwether bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, faced multiple threats.Bitcoin (BTC) was down 11% for the quarter as traders felt the continuing nervousness over the market uncertainty thanks to the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance.“The probability of a recession is high,” crypto trader Thomas Kralow said in an emailed comment. “People lose their jobs, the Fed pivots too late and we will see the same situation that played out back in 2008. When the Fed pivoted there was a relief rally for S&P 500, but as the interest rates finally started going down the market crashed another 40%.”Kralow pointed out that the markets bottomed when the fed funds rate was basically at zero, adding: “This doesn’t bode well for bitcoin in 2023, and we could potentially see its price fall to $10,000 or even lower next year.”[1] As of Dec. 15, 2022, the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS) was updated, and the definition of “currency” changed. However, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) Family will reflect the changes as of the January reconstitution in accordance with its standard methodology.(Fourth quarter performance as of Dec 15, 2022.)The CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Index (SMT)The CoinDesk DeFi Index (DCF)The CoinDesk Culture & Entertainment Index (CNE)The CoinDesk Computing Index (CPU)The CoinDesk Digitization Index (DTZ)",2022/12/20
77,"As if 2022 weren’t already brutal enough on crypto investors, the fourth quarter brought an ugly coda with the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange – triggering another leg down in prices, spurring a fresh bout of contagion and enshrining the year as one of the worst ever in the digital-asset industry’s history.The CoinDesk Market Ex Stablecoin Index (CMIX), a broad benchmark encompassing 163 digital assets, fell 12% from September through Dec. 15, and the gloom is hard to shake off as analysts turn their sights to 2023.The CoinDesk Market Ex Stablecoin Index (CMIX): CMIX is a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of constituents in the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) excluding stablecoins. Inclusion of a digital asset in CMIX is subject to minimum trading and exchange eligibility requirements.The crypto industry’s self-inflicted wounds – U.S. prosecutors and regulators this month accused Bankman-Fried of orchestrating a $8 billion scheme to defraud investors – came as the Federal Reserve kept ratcheting monetary conditions ever tighter to bring down soaring inflation, adding stiff downward pressure on prices for cryptocurrencies and other risky assets.Last year’s price run-up in the largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), to a record $69,000 brought rampant speculation and risk-taking by crypto traders who used “leverage,” or borrowed money, to amplify their bets. The unwinding of that leverage over the course of 2022 served to accelerate the market’s descent. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index has tumbled 65% this year to about $16,594 at the time of writing.""It kind of almost got out of hand, and in a lot of ways it did get out of hand,” said Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto analytics firm Amberdata. “Now we're getting a recalibration of excess leverage. We're also getting consequences for people who've kind of taken advantage of that opportunity.”Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest by market cap, slid 5.5% in the quarter through Dec. 15, and it’s down 68% in 2022, its worst performance since the crypto winter of 2018. The broad downward market pressures and a dropoff in activity outweighed any pickup in sentiment that came from the blockchain’s successful upgrade this year – the “Merge” – to a more energy-efficient “proof-of-stake” network from a “proof-of-work” system similar to Bitcoin’s. More recently, speculation has mounted that the change might make ether more prone to regulation as a security under U.S. regulations.Coming into the fourth quarter, crypto traders and analysts were speculating whether markets might be starting to heal from the steep losses earlier in the year inflicted by the collapse of Terra and the knock-on casualties of crypto financial firms Celsius Network, Voyager Digital and Three Arrows Capital.The epic unraveling of FTX – initiated by an exclusive CoinDesk report that the Alameda Research trading firm’s balance sheet was dependent on sister company FTX’s in-house utility token, FTT – soon dashed the optimism.FTT was, unsurprisingly, one of the biggest losers in digital-asset markets, plunging about 95% just in the fourth quarter alone. (The FTT token wasn’t part of the CoinDesk Market Index because it didn’t meet the key requirement of being listed for at least 30 days on at least two eligible exchanges. It was only listed on one.)Among the biggest losers in the CMIX from the FTX fallout was the Solana blockchain’s SOL token, the largest among a handful of so-called “Sam Coins” that had been championed by Bankman-Fried. The SOL price tanked 58% during the quarter.The contagion spread to Maple Finance, a decentralized lending platform that suffered some $54 million of loan defaults, some of them linked indirectly to the FTX failure. Maple’s MPL token was the quarter’s single biggest loser in the CMIX, diving 78%.A few winners worth mentioning: Dogecoin (DOGE) rallied 42% for the quarter to date (QTD). The meme coin doubled in October following Elon Musk’s dramatic $44 billion takeover of Twitter. (By the end of the quarter it was looking a bit dog-tired, shaving some of those returns.) Litecoin (LTC) jumped 35% in the quarter, with its third mining-reward halving approaching in 2023; the scheduled blockchain event will cut LTC's pace of supply expansion by 50%.Recent signs have emerged in digital-asset markets that the FTX turmoil may have passed.Whether that translates to a market turnaround in 2023 might depend, to a certain extent, on the direction of U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy. Bitcoin’s overall price direction is still closely linked to the trajectory of traditional markets, and the largest cryptocurrency by market value often sets the course for broader digital-assets markets.Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at the crypto asset manager Bitwise, says the digital-asset markets are entering a “period of indifference.”“If you look back at other previous bear markets, they go through this classic style of people not believing it’s happening, and people being angered that there’s a period of capitulation. And [people say the] worst, and crypto is dead,” Hougan said. “We’re going to have to go through a period of six months where no one outside of the crypto industry cares about crypto.”He added: “That’s sort of what leads into the next bull market that’s happened each time in the past, and I see no reason to believe that this time will be different.”As of Dec 15, 2022, CMIX lost 12% QTD, and included 163 digital assets assigned to 33 industries in 21 industry groups in six sectors according to the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS).(Fourth quarter performance as of Dec 15, 2022.)The CoinDesk Currency Index, Excluding Stablecoins (CCX)The CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Index (SMT)The CoinDesk DeFi Index (DCF)The CoinDesk Culture & Entertainment Index (CNE)The CoinDesk Computing Index (CPU)The CoinDesk Digitization Index (DTZ)",2022/12/20
78,"Bitcoiners in Nigeria, Tanzania, South Africa, Kenya and five other African countries can now send and receive bitcoin (BTC) without a smartphone or Internet connection. Just a basic feature phone and text code will suffice, thanks to a digital wallet from a company called Machankura.Despite the global smartphone revolution, mid-2000s-style phones with more limited functionality remain extremely popular in Africa. Machankura – a word that’s South African township slang meaning ""money"" – has popped up to serve that base of devices and satisfy the desire among many on the continent to use bitcoin as a currency for transactions.The technological challenge is high, of course. No internet connection and low-horsepower phones mean boiling down the money exchange to essentially sending something like texts. Machankura says it works, and taps into Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, which facilities faster and cheaper transactions.“I started Machankura to make bitcoin more accessible in communities, where not everyone has an Internet-connected device,” Kgothatso Ngako, South African computer science researcher and developer turned entrepreneur, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Anyone who's interested in using bitcoin and living on bitcoin should be able to do so easily.”Read more: South African Non-Profit Bitcoin Ekasi Opens Education Center Unlike other places where bitcoin acts more like digital gold – or something to hoard as an investment or speculative instrument – several communities in South Africa, like Bitcoin Ekasi, use bitcoin as they would a traditional currency. But exactly how do they do that without an iPhone or other smartphone?That’s where “mobile money” comes in. That doesn’t just involve cryptocurrencies. It’s any service that lets people conduct financial transactions through their phone, without the need for a traditional bank account. According to the World Bank, about a third of adults in sub-Saharan Africa have a mobile money account – showing a large audience of receptive potential customers for Machankura.Mobile money involves a communications protocol called Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), which is similar to the more widely known texting protocol called Short Message Service (SMS).“In Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa, if it's a digital payment, there's a [good] chance that it's a mobile money payment instead of a card,” Ngako explains.Read more: Crypto Is Quietly Thriving in Sub-Saharan Africa: Chainalysis ReportTo send bitcoin with Machankura, first-time users simply dial a country code like “*920*8333#” for Ghana or “*483*8333#” for Kenya. This brings up a registration menu that requests a five-digit PIN.After registering, a subsequent menu offers additional functionality like sending or receiving bitcoin and viewing transaction history (users press the number on their feature phone corresponding to the desired menu option).If a customer chooses to send or receive bitcoin, Machankura has integrated one crucial feature that significantly improves the user experience – personalized Lightning addresses.“On the feature phone keypad, the user has to be able to input a Lightning address,” Ngako explains.Instead of regular Lightning invoice addresses that can be over 200 alphanumeric characters long – well over the 182 USSD character limit – these personalized addresses are the length of a typical email handle. This makes them much easier to type out on feature phones with multi-press text entry (where each digit represents multiple letters).Machankura’s default Lightning address combines a user’s phone number and Machankura’s “@8333.mobi” domain (e.g., 123456789@8333.mobi). Users can also modify these addresses to conceal their phone numbers (e.g., johndoe@8333.mobi).Once a user has a few sats in the wallet (1 bitcoin is comprised of 100 million satoshis, or “sats”), integrations with gift card and voucher services like Bitrefill and Azteco make it possible to spend those sats on everyday purchases or redeem vouchers for bitcoin.“I went to my grandmother's village in Mpumalanga, and over an hour-long walk, in seven out of eight stores, I was able to redeem my voucher,” Ngako says.If Machankura sounds too good to be true, remember that it’s a custodial wallet, meaning users don’t control their own bitcoin and must trust the company. This also explains how users can send and receive bitcoin with no Internet connection – Machankura does it for them behind the scenes (by running Internet-connected Bitcoin and Lightning nodes on the back end).There’s no “free lunch,” so some of those behind-the-scenes costs are passed on to users. Specifically, sending bitcoin will incur a 1% transaction fee, which is Machankura’s revenue source.Despite the fees and the custodial model, Ngako’s efforts have garnered glowing reviews from prominent Bitcoiners including Elizabeth Stark, CEO and co-founder of Lightning infrastructure firm Lightning Labs.Ngako is hoping to raise capital and eventually establish Machankura in all 54 African countries over the next few years.“It's been self-funded to this point,” Ngako said. “And, now, I'm in the process of raising capital, so I'll see how that goes.”CORRECTION (Dec. 20, 2022, 20:58 UTC): Corrects spelling of village’s name to Mpumalanga.",2022/12/20
79,"Think back to one year ago. Bitcoin traded at around $50,000, you couldn’t watch sports without seeing a crypto advertisement, and you could get rich – or at least it felt that way – by minting a non-fungible token (NFT) of your left nostril.At the time, who could have predicted the collapse of Celsius Network and Voyager Digital? Or that Matt Damon would become a crypto punchline? Or that the space’s golden child, Sam Bankman-Fried, would turn from Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader?This article is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.This is all preamble to say that there are no crystal balls. Predictions are often wrong. Trends can change on a dime. But then again, perhaps after the FTX-flavored gloom of the last two months, speculating on 2023 is exactly what we need to cleanse the palate.“As we enter 2023, what happens with crypto funding in Q1 will be critical as to whether we stay in a sustained bear market,” suspects Jamie Burke, CEO and founder of Outlier Ventures. On the one hand, he notes that “the strength of the venture market has persisted, with billions of funding still pouring into the space and high levels of capital waiting to be deployed,” and that “we have seen a record number of applications in our most recent cohorts for 2022.”Then again, Burke acknowledges that “the venture landscape is undeniably changing,” and that “fund managers going into 2023 are conserving capital” instead of the bull run’s strategy of “spray and pray.” He predicts that next year, many investors will “double down on existing, less risky investments from later-stage companies already showing growth.”As to what that could mean for the space at large? Or how else crypto might twist and turn in 2023? We’ve rounded up predictions from smart people in the space – from the bullish to the skeptical.See also: The Future of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in 2023 | OpinionThe exact outcome is anyone’s guess, but 2023 could be the year where the clashes over regulation finally reach their climax. “There’s going to be harsh crypto regulation proposed and an epic battle by the community to fight the parts of it that threaten decentralization,” says Laura Shin, host of the “Unchained” podcast.“Larger macro downturn market conditions should hopefully shift crypto projects away from speculation and more towards utility – one major utility category simply being meaningful, fun, social experiences,” predicts Alex Zhang, the de facto head of Friends with Benefits DAO. He expects this to translate to “more meaningful Web3 social platforms and protocols,” and foresees growth in “interoperable identity, on-chain social graphs, and crypto-abstracted social experiences.”And for a less optimistic take…“The contagion isn’t anywhere close to over,” says Cas Piancey, co-host of the “Crypto Critics’ Corner” podcast. Piancey says that “companies, banks and funds are desperately hoping the market moves past the FTX and Alameda collapse or strictly focuses on their malfeasance,” but whether people like it or not, “you can’t wish away a credit crunch and exposure to bad counterparties. We will see the closure of funds and the faltering of companies we didn’t expect – mostly simply due to the fact that the contagion is too vast and too difficult for us all to quantify.”Read more: ReFi Will Take Crypto and Climate Change Mainstream | OpinionWhen I spoke with Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer of Human Rights Foundation, he had just returned from a bitcoin conference in Ghana. “I was blown away,” says Gladstein. “I was staggered by the number of bitcoin entrepreneurs and leaders from so many different countries.” He met people from rural Cameroon, from Democratic Republic of the Congo, from Somalia, from conflict zones. “They’re all just building on bitcoin. It’s legitimately amazing,” he says, which is why he believes that “global adoption is probably the number one story for next year.”When asked for his 2023 predictions, the bitcoin mega-bull Peter McCormack, host of “What Bitcoin Did” podcast, replied simply, “Real Bedford will win the league.” Obviously this is a cheeky joke (McCormack purchased the team in 2021), but this might contain the kernel of a deeper truth: For many in the space, during crypto winter, it’s useful – even healthy – to focus on other interests.“Fashion will continue to lead the way when it comes to Web3 adoption,” says Cathy Hackl, chief metaverse officer at Journey. “We will see further collaborations between Web3 personalities and consumer and luxury brands that want to explore new commerce models and customer touchpoints.” Hackl’s bonus prediction: “With the rise of generative AI, we might see blockchain play a significant role in helping us to distinguish between content created by AI and content created by humans.”“The sustained high-risk appetite in NFT-funding in 2022 is a strong indicator that it will be one of the first sectors to recover next year,” says Burke. “Throughout the past year, we were already beginning to see major NFT investments from major Web2 brands [Starbucks and Disney] and across Web3. … This shows no sign of stopping in 2023. Brands will continue to flock to NFTs.”Burke is similarly bullish on gaming, as “prominent Web3 game titles that have been in development for quite some time including Big Time, Star Atlas, Ember Sword, will finally see the light of day in 2023, either as full-fledged games or more playable demos.”As for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)? “Although it may seem that the current bear market has forced the industry to hit pause, the growth of new DAOs has accelerated exponentially, with each month in 2022 producing more new DAOs than 2021 witnessed altogether,” says Burke.“Exchange stack gets disaggregated – we see custody, brokerage and exchange/price discovery get broken out into different players, just like in [traditional finance]. This makes it impossible for another FTX to happen,” says Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at Dragonfly Capital.Then Qureshi offers a parallel prediction: “When trust is low, incumbents consolidate. Coinbase, Binance, Uniswap will likely gain market share in aggregate, as people are less likely to trust smaller and weaker players. Network effects get stronger.”And finally …“Read the room and assess the damage,” says Sandra Ro, CEO of the Global Blockchain Business Council, who then gives a bit of advice for the space at large: “Regroup with humility, rebuild with integrity, regain trust, rise again.”",2022/12/20
80,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) took off in the summer of 2020 and has become synonymous with the last bull market as well as a lot of speculative activity since then. DeFi was born, in part, to address the failures of banking institutions to provide for a transparent and inclusive financial system. ReFi, or regenerative finance, is about leveraging crypto rails to rebuild our economies in ways that are more inclusive and sustainable. My prediction in 2023 is that ReFi will be hotter than DeFi, especially at the intersection of crypto and climate change.Outside of the bear market and scandals, the Ethereum Merge dominated much of the narrative in 2022. One of the most discussed, debated and analyzed outcomes from the Merge was the resulting drastic reduction in carbon emissions from the new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism for Ethereum, particularly juxtaposed with Bitcoin’s energy intensive proof-of-work mechanism.Yet, this is just the tip of the iceberg regarding the relationship between crypto and climate. As we head into 2023 we are starting to see dozens of exciting Web3 projects focused on leveraging crypto rails for accelerating the path to the low-carbon economy, while new venture funds focused on ReFi are being launched to accelerate these projects.Boyd Cohen is CEO and co-founder of Iomob, the developers of WheelCoin, a Move2Earn game that rewards users for moving green. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 outlook.There is a surprising number of layer one and layer two blockchains that are explicitly focused on promoting and supporting the low-carbon economy and even creating ecosystem funding to encourage ReFi projects to deploy on their blockchain. The list includes Cosmos, Hedera, Topl, Polygon, Celo, Near and Algorand among many others.Yet, what is more interesting, to me at least, are the projects being deployed on these blockchains that have a more direct impact on industries, people and the planet as we move up the stack towards the app layer.The most dominant ReFi sector for climate has been tied to bringing more transparency to the $270 billion global carbon offset market. Carbon offsets have long been questioned regarding the credibility of the actual claims made by carbon originators and the offset buyers. While standards have been introduced to help create more accountability in the sector, there remains healthy skepticism in the public domain.The Cosmos-based Regen Network focuses on helping communities of land owners generate on-chain digital carbon offsets. Meanwhile, Klima DAO has created a tokenized carbon offset scheme which, at the time of writing, has supported the transparent removal of more than 17 million tons of carbon from the global atmosphere.What is even more exciting to me is that we are starting to see greenshoots of ReFi that go way beyond base-layer blockchains and carbon offsets. Every industry and consumer activity has some kind of climate impact and ReFi projects are emerging to tackle these challenges on crypto rails.Similar to bringing carbon offsets on-chain, Reneum is leveraging blockchain tech to create more transparency in the renewable energy credits (REC) space. Meanwhile, Powerledger has been an early player in facilitating peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralized renewable energy trading since its inception in 2016.On the end-user level, I am optimistic we will start to see ways to gamify the adoption of low carbon lifestyles such as through move2earn (M2E) projects. Tying M2E with carbon reduction and perhaps the creation of personalized, transparent and tokenized carbon offsets could become a thing in 2023.Recently the World Economic Forum launched the Crypto Sustainability Coalition to focus on accelerating the adoption of ReFi use cases. The famous X Prize, created originally by Elon Musk to reward disruptive climate innovation, is now moving into the ReFi space.In the past few months several new venture funds and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) have been launched focused on the ReFi space such as Cerulean Ventures, AeraForce DAO, ReFi Venture Studio, Allegory, a100x, Vanagon Ventures, Possible Ventures and Draft Ventures. Just as mainstream venture capitalists have increasingly embraced environment and social governance (ESG) metrics and launched sustainability-focused funds, I believe in 2023 we will also start to see mainstream-impact funds and crypto funds, deploying ReFi-themed funds.Yes, as we head into 2023 we remain in a bear market with little hope for a near-term return towards more bullish conditions. I am convinced 2023 will be the year that ReFi gains more mainstream attention and adoption and helps to prove how crypto has tangible impacts on the real world and helps to change the narrative from the scams of 2022 to a force for positive change and an accelerant towards a more sustainable, low-carbon economy.",2022/12/20
81,"On Wednesday, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) introduced the “Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act,” which would impose sweeping surveillance and registration requirements on almost all participants in blockchain networks – including software developers, miners and wallet creators. The bill would also effectively ban privacy-enhancing technologies in blockchain networks. The bill is a disaster for digital privacy and civil liberties.Marta Belcher is the president and chair of the Filecoin Foundation and the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web and general counsel and head of policy at Protocol Labs. She is also special counsel to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a member of the Zcash Foundation Board. Her views are her own.The bill would require almost all participants in blockchain networks to register as money service businesses, including not only miners and wallet creators but also software developers. Those who would need to register as money service businesses under the bill’s shockingly expansive language include miners, validators, nodes, both custodial and ""self-hosted"" cryptocurrency wallet providers and, as a catch-all, any “independent network participants” who have “control over network protocols.”Anyone who fits into one of these categories (i.e., basically any blockchain network participant) would need to register with the government as a money service business, develop and maintain complicated anti-money-laundering programs, collect the personal information of every person who uses their software and automatically file reports with the government about users’ transactions over a certain amount (regardless of whether those transactions are suspicious).See also: The Coming Privacy Wars In short, the bill would grind the entire blockchain ecosystem in the U.S. to a halt, including chilling the ability of software developers to work on these technologies and preventing Americans from interacting with permissionless blockchains. It is simply too onerous for individual network participants like developers and miners to comply with the rules for money service businesses.In fact, compliance is not only onerous but in many cases impossible. For example, money service businesses are required to verify the identity of all users and report information about those users’ transactions to the government. For many blockchain network participants, this is simply not possible. For example, bitcoin miners have no way of knowing the identity of the users whose transactions they are facilitating and developers of open-source software have no way of knowing the identities of those who ultimately use their software.This is by design: The precise reason that blockchain technology is important, from a civil liberties perspective, is that it imports the privacy of cash into the online world. This new bill seeks to flip the entire purpose of blockchain on its head, turning it into a permissioned technology in which all users are surveilled by centralized gatekeepers.In addition, the bill effectively bans privacy-enhancing technologies in blockchain networks. The bill would prohibit all financial institutions from handling, using or transacting with digital asset mixers, privacy coins and “any other anonymity-enhancing technologies.” The list of financial institutions prohibited from interacting with privacy-enhancing technologies includes the broad group of blockchain network participants that would be classified as money-service businesses under the bill – meaning that developers, miners, validators and custodial and self-hosted wallet creators would all effectively be prohibited from interacting with privacy-enhancing technologies, including privacy coins.In introducing the bill, Sen. Warren used the refrain that privacy-enhancing technology facilitates crime. This is wrong, and it’s exactly the line of reasoning we hear from critics of end-to-end encryption and Tor (which enables anonymous web browsing). That a technology could be used to violate the law does not mean that there is something wrong with that technology. Criminals have long used cash to commit crimes, but we don’t call for a ban on cash as a result. For the same reason, we don’t call for a ban on cars, even though they can be used as getaway vehicles. In the 1980s, studios tried to make VCRs illegal because they could be used for copyright infringement – and they almost succeeded. Like cars and VCRs, privacy-enhancing technologies serve an important purpose and should not be banned merely because they could be misused.See also: The Ongoing Fight for Privacy – a Conversation With Marta Belcher That purpose is protecting civil liberties. Sen. Warren seems to have forgotten that privacy and anonymity are not bad or illegal; in fact, they are essential for civil liberties. Privacy is especially important for financial transactions, which provide an intimate window into our lives – what organizations we donate to, what books and products we buy, who we support and where we go. The ability to transact privately allows people to engage in First Amendment-⁠protected political activities, including protesting, donating to advocacy organizations and engaging in activities that may be sensitive or controversial. That blockchain technology imports the privacy protections of cash into the online world is a feature, not a bug.The U.S. government has long been targeting blockchain networks to expand the reach of its financial surveillance, including adding the Tornado Cash mixer to the U.S. sanctions list earlier this year. Imposing sweeping reporting requirements on nearly every blockchain network participant and effectively banning privacy-enhancing technologies in blockchain networks through this latest bill would create a near-total surveillance regime for blockchain transactions.",2022/12/20
82,"Bitcoin mining firm Greenidge Generation (GREE) came to an agreement with its lender, NYDIG, about restructuring $74.7 million of debt, though a bankruptcy is still on the cards.Cash burn is unsustainable and the firm's board is engaged ""in active discussions about the potential for, and timing of, a voluntary bankruptcy filing,"" Greenidge said in a Tuesday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If the deal with NYDIG is finalized, Greenidge still needs $20 million in fresh funding through 2023 to avoid bankruptcy.Under the deal, which is currently in the form of a non-binding term sheet, NYDIG will purchase 2.8 exahash per second (EH/s) worth of Greenidge's bitcoin mining machines, and extinguish $57 million to $68 million of the debt. That will leave Greenidge with 1.2 EH/s of machines, and the miner will also pledge the rest of its unencumbered assets to secure the rest of the loan, which will be somewhere between $6 million to $17 million.The loan in question had about $74.7 million outstanding as of Sept. 30. Prior to reaching a deal with NYDIG, Greenidge had estimated it would have to spend a minimum of $66.5 million in principal payments throughout 2023.Greenidge will host NYDIG's machines, effectively changing its business model from self-mining to hosting, the filing said. Hosting has proved a difficult business model to maintain in 2022, particularly for miners like Greenidge that are exposed to natural gas prices. Greenidge's costs of revenue, which come both from mining bitcoin and selling energy produced in its natural gas plant in upstate New York, grew by 104% year on year in Q3, according to Greenidge's quarterly earnings report.Greenidge is one of several miners that have warned about cash burn rates, including Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Core Scientific (CORZ).During October and November, Greenidge burned through $8 million a month, of which $5.5 million went to NYDIG payments. It expects the same cash burn rate for December, which would put a significant hole through its remaining $22 million of cash and cash equivalents. If Greendige doesn't secure funding, it may run out of cash in the next two months.The miner will host up to 74 megawatts (MW) of NYDIG's machines. As of Sept. 30, Greenidge ""powered approximately 76 MW of mining capacity capable of producing an estimated aggregate hash rate of 2.4 EH/s."" The firm owns a 106 MW natural gas power plant in New York.Greenidge will also transfer its coupons with machine manufacturer Bitmain to NYDIG. Within three months of the debt restructuring and hosting deals being agreed upon, Greenidge will also transfer machines awaiting deployment to NYDIG, and later provide the lender with an additional 39 MW of hosting.The miner has also faced regulatory turbulence in its home state of New York, where environmental concerns led to its air permit renewal being denied this summer.UPDATE (Dec. 20, 13:10 UTC): Adds additional details and background.",2022/12/20
83,"Layer 2 Labs has raised a $3 million seed round from angel investors to bring drivechains and other innovative technologies to Bitcoin.Drivechains are a type of sidechain – a secondary blockchain that interacts with a primary blockchain and aims to offer a better user experience (UX). The company’s CEO and founder, Paul Sztorc, a well-known Bitcoin researcher and developer, has been working on drivechains since 2015.Sztorc outlined the concept of drivechains in Bitcoin improvement proposals (BIPs) 300 and 301. The technology, which will be Layer 2 Labs’ primary focus, allows users to move bitcoin (BTC) back and forth between the main Bitcoin blockchain and multiple drivechains.According to Sztorc, the purpose of drivechains is to give Bitcoiners access to innovative features and products currently confined to altcoin networks. Examples would be Zcash’s zero-knowledge proofs, a way of proving something without revealing sensitive information, and Ethereum’s Augur, a prediction market where users bid on specific outcomes.“We believe that drivechains have the potential to kill altcoins, increase bitcoin adoption and provide the catalyst for hyperbitcoinization,” said the company in a release provided to CoinDesk. (Hyperbitcoinization is the point where Bitcoin becomes the world’s dominant monetary system.)Besides Sztorc, Layer 2 Labs’ founding team includes Bitcoin Core contributor CryptAxe and 8-year Kraken veteran Austin Alexander.Read more: How Two New Sidechains Proposals Could Change Bitcoin's DNA",2022/12/20

85,"Bitcoin (BTC) traded higher early Tuesday, defying the Bank of Japan (BOJ)-inspired slump in stock markets.The BOJ unexpectedly lifted the cap on the 10-year Japanese government bond yield to 0.5% from the previous 0.25%, ending the long period of near-zero interest rates. The 10-year yield serves as a benchmark for other borrowing rates.The central bank said the policy tweak would facilitate the transmission of monetary-easing effects, indicating that it didn't want markets to read it as a sign the BOJ is finally pivoting away from liquidity easing.However, risk assets did just that. The futures tied to the S&P 500 fell nearly 1% and Nikkei, Japan's benchmark equity index, tanked nearly 3%. The Japanese yen jumped over 2% against the U.S. dollar. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield rose from 0.22% to 0.43%, while the 10-year Treasury yield jumped nearly 10 basis points to 3.69%.Bitcoin, however, remained resilient, rising 2% to $16,800. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value after bitcoin, rose 3.2% to $1,206, CoinDesk data shows.The reaction in equities and bond yields is understandable, considering the BOJ's policy of capping the 10-year yield near zero with unlimited liquidity-boosting open-ended bond purchases, also known as yield curve control (YCC), was a major source of downward pressure on borrowing costs in Asia and worldwide and supported risk-taking. The Yen was supposedly used to fund risk-taking activities elsewhere.The central bank introduced yield curve control six years ago and remained committed to it this year even as the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks lifted rates.""The BOJ funding was the cheapest source of liquidity,"" Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital said. ""While the policy tweak is not a removal of YCC, the signaling will lead people to extrapolate that BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will seek to exit YCC by the end of this term in April.""QCP added that the surprise decision to lift the 10-year yield cap to 0.5% during the low-volume, pre-Christmas days has raised the risk of a VaR shock but is unlikely to have a direct consequence for cryptocurrencies.""We doubt crypto assets are directly affected by the decision,"" QCP said, adding that a big meltdown in equities could bring more pain to bitcoin.Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at Astronaut Capital, voiced a similar opinion. ""The initial market reaction to BOJ has been clear risk off. It’s hard to say if it will stick, however cryptos have rebounded slightly. At this stage we believe any strength or decorrelation is simply a lag. If we see equities lower, the same will be true for crypto,"" Dibb told CoinDesk.Fin Twitter is scared that BOJ's decision has set the stage for a global meltdown.""Bank of Japan basically broke the world tonight,"" Christian H. Cooper, an exchange-traded fund portfolio manager at Subversive, tweeted. ""A minor policy tweak has huge implications that will take weeks to play out.""""BOJ was the last low-yield holdout and now that changes. Spikes in rates, stocks lower (for weeks), + Chaos,' Cooper added.Kyle Bass, chief investment officer at Hayman Capital Management, tweeted that BOJ will ""deeply regret"" the move and the emerging world is at risk due to the policy tweak.Crypto services provider Matrixport's head of strategy and research, Markus Thielen, said the BOJ's move and the resulting yen strength could boost demand for other assets, including cryptocurrencies.""Japanese stocks tend to benefit from a weaker yen due to the export link, a stronger yen will make Japanese stocks less attractive to foreigners as well as to locals. This might increase the interest in alternative investments – such as BTC,"" Thielen wrote in a note shared with CoinDesk.With the BOJ hinting at a potential hawkish shift with the YCC tweak and the Fed tightening priced to a large extent, the path of least resistance for the yen appears to be on the higher side.""This year was a perfect storm for USD/JPY, as the Fed's hiking cycle combined with the Bank of Japan's insanely easy monetary policy resulted in a 32% move from trough to peak. I believe next year we will see a start of a Fed easing cycle and the start of the BOJ's tightening cycle, creating another perfect storm to the downside,"" Geoffrey Chen, global macro investor and founder of the Huang Chen Foundation, said in a Substack post.The odds, therefore, appears stacked in favor of bitcoin maintaining its direct correlation with the Japanese yen.UPDATE (Dec. 20, 09:22 UTC): Adds section ""strong yen, a blessing in disguise for BTC.""",2022/12/20
86,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin heads lower into Asia hours, though some analysts wonder if the largest cryptocurrency might hold up better than stocks in an earnings recession.Insights: Taiwan's dreams of becoming a crypto hub remain elusive, despite the inevitable chatter that sprang up following a successful Taipei Blockchain Week.Bitcoin dropping into Asia trading hoursBy Bradley KeounBitcoin (BTC) was dropping in early Asia hours, down 2% over the past 24 hours, to around $16,439. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was also down about 2%. In a potentially unnerving development, bitcoin addresses tied to the defunct Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX suddenly became active.Trading was mostly anemic during U.S. hours, with equity markets starting to reflect nervousness over the potential for any drop-off in corporate earnings that might come with a recession. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.49%. The S&P 500 slid 0.90% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.49%.Crypto analysts are starting to wonder if bitcoin might hold up better than stocks if the economy turns down.""The muted beta in crypto aligns with the idea that crypto assets might be less susceptible to a drawdown in equities catalyzed by an earnings recession,"" FundStrat's Sean Farrell wrote Monday in a note to investors.According to the crypto hedge fund BitBull Capital, the $20,000 mark looms as a major resistance point for the bitcoin market. On the downside, the next point to watch would be the November low around $15,500.Taipei Blockchain Week was a success, but there are reasons Taiwan isn’t a crypto hubBy Sam ReynoldsAfter every successful crypto conference in Taipei, the narrative that Taiwan is the undiscovered blockchain hub of Asia invariably comes up. It never seems to have any legs.Taipei Blockchain Week, a conference put together by Taiwan-focused Bu Zhi Dao (a play on the Chinese term for ‘I don’t know’), wrapped up Saturday. Despite being put together at the last minute because of uncertainty around Covid rules, there were around 1,700 in attendance. It wasn’t quite the star-studded Asia Blockchain Summit, but the energy was optimistic, despite the bear market.It’s hard to say that about Taiwan’s prospects for becoming a blockchain hub. Back in 2018, then KMT-legislator Jason Hsu said Taiwan could become a “blockchain island.” This year, the Hong Kong-based investor Sora Ventures said it was moving its fund to Taiwan. But an attempt to create a Security Token Offering structure to allow crypto firms to raise money in a regulatory-friendly way never really took off, because of a low cap on the amount one can fundraise.While there are many digital nomads in the crypto industry in Taiwan, including projects that purport to be on the island, few are actually incorporated locally as the rules around capital formation make it too difficult. Many business cards given out at Taipei Blockchain Week carried addresses in Singapore, Hong Kong and BVI.“Rarely is Taiwan the place to incorporate a start-up company's parent,” Ross Feingold, special counsel at Taipei-based Titan Attorneys at Law, told CoinDesk. “The traditional corporate structures are not start-up friendly because of limitations on a founder's services as payment for shares and limitations on share transfer restrictions among other issues, as well as the corporate governance requirements.”Authorities in Taiwan created a new company structure in 2015 that tried to address some of these issues but it's complex to understand, Feingold explained, especially for those who can’t read Chinese at the level of an accountant or lawyer.Those that do make the attempt to incorporate in Taiwan complain about the three to four months it takes; a company can be registered in Singapore in an average of 1.5 days and in less than 48 hours in Hong Kong. Both of those jurisdictions use common law, with a share structure more familiar to international investors, and they have more competitive tax regimes than Taiwan’s corporate tax rate and its withholding tax on dividends.At the height of COVID-19, Taiwan’s digital nomad friendly Gold Card, which allowed one to make the move provided they could prove they had an income of $67,000 or more, made things look appealing. Feingold says that’s only the case for digital nomads and freelancers.“The allure waned if the individual really needs to be in a place where the corporate headquarters is sited,” he said. “Some of the same issues that hinder Taiwan as a startup nation existed then and remain unchanged.”Feingold says that while Taiwan’s regulator, the Financial Supervisory Commission, has put in minimal restrictions for now, there’s always the “lingering risk that Taiwan's financial or tax authorities become more proactive in regulating the industry.”For what it’s worth, Thailand, another regional suitor, also has complicated and arcane company formation laws, even though Thailand’s Siam Commercial Bank, the most institutional of all investors in-country, actively invests and supports decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. That might help explain why Thai-based teams also incorporate elsewhere – much like those in Taiwan.11:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(3:00 UTC) Bank of Japan Interest Rate Decision9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Canada Retail Sales (MoM/Oct)11:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(15:00 UTC) Eurozone Consumer Confidence (Dec) In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Sam Bankman-Fried Reportedly Expected to Accept US Extradition; Bitcoin Remains in Tight RangeFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has reportedly had a change of heart and won't contest U.S. extradition.

87,"Kazakh legislators approved a bill last week that will introduce corporate tax for bitcoin miners as well as restrictions for the industry’s energy consumption nationwide.The law, dubbed “On Regulating Digital Assets in Kazakhstan,” was one of three pieces of crypto-related legislation approved by the country’s lower house, known as the Mazhilis, last Thursday, according to the parliament website. The bill now heads to the Senate for discussion and another round of voting. The legislation came to the table only in recent months, but the central Asian nation had been struggling with power shortages since at least fall 2021.If the Senate also approves the bill, the president has to sign it for it to become law. The Senate might vote on amendments, in which case the bill will be sent back to the Mazhilis.Kazakhstan saw a massive influx of crypto miners from neighboring China after Beijing banned the industry in May 2021. At that time China was the world’s largest bitcoin mining hub.It didn’t take long before Kazakhstan’s electrical grid, much of it a legacy of Soviet times, started crumbling under the new load. On top of the miners’ demand, technical failures in interconnection lines and power stations greatly exacerbated the situation, such that Kazakhstan, which until 2021 was a net power exporter, now sometimes imports energy from Russia.Read more: Kazakhstan’s Crypto Miners Face New Regulations After Contributing to Power ShortagesKazakhstan’s grid operator, KEGOC, cut off electricity to crypto mines in January for several months, while a campaign to crack down on illegal mining has been ongoing.CoinDesk learned about details of the legislation from people who are involved in the discussions and in local media.According to current discussions, the bill will allocate about 500 megawatts (MW) to miners. On top of that, miners that have registered with the government will only be able to buy power from the grid when there is an excess.The guaranteed volume is small compared to Kazakhstan’s total mining industry. Officials estimate around 1,000 MW-1,200 MW of electricity is consumed by crypto miners in Kazakhstan.The 500 MW cap is essentially a guarantee to miners that not all operations will be shut down, said Azamat Akhmetzhanov, press secretary of the Kazakhstan Association of Blockchain Technologies, a local industry group. But it simply isn’t enough – even as many miners have already left the country – said Didar Bekbau, founder of local mining firm Xive.io.This solution might solve Kazakhstan’s energy problems and power outages, but it remains to be seen exactly how the surplus will be calculated, Akhmetzhanov said.“Maybe the energy industry must change, because now the government regulates tariffs and doesn't create incentives for building new power generation organically,” Bekbau said.Those that are connected to renewable energy providers may not be subject to the requirement of only buying when there is a surplus, said Bekbau.Under the new law, miners will also only be able to buy grid power from KOREM, a state-owned enterprise that administers the day-ahead energy markets, according to local media site reports. In day-ahead markets, energy is traded for delivery within the next 24 hours of any given time. Miners will be able to buy in free market conditions on KOREM at wholesale prices, without any price restrictions or controls, local media reported.Crucially, the bill enshrines that miners have to pay corporate tax. Preferential taxation benefits that some could enjoy as high-tech firms in a special economic zone have already been withdrawn, said Akhmetzhanov and Bekbau.President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev signed into law a tax hike for miners' electricity usage in August, which is set to take effect at the start of 2023. The bill doesn’t change this hike, but it ensures that miners pay corporate taxes and can’t use the special economic zone to avoid an increased rate.It looks like miners will have to pay double tax, making them less competitive globally, Bekbau said, who thinks that the electricity tax should be eliminated. The blockchain association's press secretary however believes that the bill just ensures that the corporate tax will be ""calculated in more detail.""Miners might also be forced to sell three-quarters of their mined crypto locally through government-approved exchanges, starting in 2024. For Bekbau, that is not great news for the miners.The “liquidity problem shouldn't be solved at the expense of miners,” who should be able to choose where to sell their coins, he said.But Akhmetzhanov thinks that it might be good news for Kazakhstan. Once the exchanges receive liquidity, “With good management and a far-sighted strategy, they will be able to enter the top 30 trading platforms in the world,” the press secretary said.“The government wants more control and taxes,” said Bekbau, adding that the legislation could bring miners’ costs to 26 Kazakh tenge per kilowatt hour (kWh), roughly $0.055/kWh. That price is relatively competitive internationally, but in a crypto winter that has already caused the mining industry to be reeling in pain, it will likely send many miners underwater.The law also stipulates two new licensing categories; one is for miners that own and operate infrastructure, and one for those that simply host their mining machines in facilities run by other companies, local media reported.All in all, the new legislation might discourage investors. Already, “trust is shaken, many investors left Kazakhstan and canceled expansion plans,” Bekbau said.Read more: Kazakhstan’s Crypto Miners Face New Regulations After Contributing to Power Shortages",2022/12/19
88,"Andrei Lugovoi, the Russian parliament's chief crypto expert, may be connected to a cash over-the-counter (OTC) network located in Moscow, according to Dossier, a Russian media outlet that published an investigation on Monday.According to Dossier, an OTC called Bankoff is operating from an office owned by a company directed by Lugovoi's wife, Ksenia. Bankoff appears to be the most active trader on Binance's peer-to-peer marketplace for deals with Russian ruble, with the highest daily trading volumes, according to Dossier's research. The almost non-existent know-your-customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) procedures allow users to buy and sell crypto via Bankoff without revealing their identity, Dossier said. (An OTC is a broker-dealer as opposed to a centralized exchange.)To close a deal with Bankoff, one must go to the Federation Tower of the fancy Moscow City business district in Russia's capital, and bring cash to the office. According to documents from Russia's property registry, the office space belongs to a company named Bratsk Electric Networks. It is owned by three people, of which Ksenia Lugovaya's share is 22.5%, according to Russia's business ownership database. (CoinDesk independently reviewed the records.)It's not clear whether Bratsk Electric Networks owns the OTC operating from its office space or renting it out. However, the same company owns a crypto mining farm in the Russian city of Bratsk, according to local media. Bratsk, located in the heart of Siberia right by the Bratsk hydro power plant, became one of the favorite locations for miners due to its cold climate and abundance of cheap electricity.Read more: Bitcoin Mining Farms Are Flourishing on the Ruins of Soviet Industry in SiberiaAndrei Lugovoi is a member of the Liberal Democratic Party's fraction in the Russian parliament, the State Duma, and also a deputy chair of the Security and Corruption Prevention Committee.

89,"More than 100 bitcoins tied to the defunct Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX were transferred out of cold wallets thought to be beyond anyone’s control over the weekend, after sitting dormant for more than three years. The company's bankruptcy trustee, Ernst and Young, did not initiate the transfers, CoinDesk has learned.QuadrigaCX went bankrupt in 2019 after the apparent death of founder and CEO Gerald Cotten. At the time of its collapse, Quadriga was believed to have owed thousands of customers nearly $200 million in various cryptocurrencies – a staggering failure for what was once Canada’s largest crypto exchange.EY, which is acting as the trustee for Quadriga’s estate, announced in February 2019 that it lost control of about 100 BTC after mistakenly sending the coins to Quadriga-operated cold wallets that the Big Four financial services firm said it couldn’t access. At the time, the bitcoin was worth around $355,000 (C$470,000).The bitcoin in these addresses remained frozen until last Friday, when the coins in all five addresses left between 6:52 p.m. ET and 7:14 p.m. ET.Magdalena Gronowska, a bankruptcy inspector and member of Quadriga's creditor committee, said the funds were not moved by EY.In total, 104.34 BTC worth around $1.7 million (C$2.4 million) at press time has left Quadriga’s wallets. Many of these funds appear to have been distributed to different wallets.The amounts sent from each wallet match the amounts sent to those wallets in 2019. The wallets in question are:Blockchain sleuth zachxbt said on Twitter that the majority of these funds, nearly 70 BTC, appear to have gone to Wasabi, a coin mixing service. It is unclear why EY, a well-established financial services institution, might want to use a crypto mixing service, whose primary purpose would be to obfuscate the source and destination of funds.""Bankruptcy Inspectors are aware Quadriga funds have moved. Thank you to blockchain investigators for following flows, we're working to gather more information and I hope we are able to recover stolen funds,"" Gronowska said.A spokesperson for EY and an attorney with Miller Thomson, which represents Quadriga's creditors, did not return requests for comment.In early reports, EY said that Cotten, as the sole proprietor of Quadriga in its waning days, was the only person who could access its funds. Investigators claimed that Cotten did not maintain clear records, part of why the effort to recover customer funds is dragging into a fourth year.The Canada Revenue Agency, the nation’s tax enforcer, is also investigating the exchange and whether or not it filed its taxes appropriately while it still operated. A person familiar with the matter said the CRA investigation was the main issue preventing the bankruptcy proceedings from continuing.UPDATE (Dec. 19, 2022, 22:20 UTC): Adds additional detail.UPDATE (Dec. 19, 20:50 UTC): Adds additional detail and confirmation that EY did not move the funds out of the wallets.",2022/12/19

Equity markets also kicked off the new week with losses as traders felt the continuing nervousness over the Federal Reserve’s hawkish message last week on tighter monetary policy until it is ""sufficiently restrictive"" to bring inflation down. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.49%. The S&P 500 slid 0.90% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.49%.Ether (ETH): The second-largest cryptocurrency followed BTC’s trajectory, also dropping around 0.5% to $1,170.Filecoin (FIL) and Storj (STORJ): FIL is down 28% over the past five days, with STORJ down 20%. Data from Coinglass points to record liquidations on long positions for storage protocols' tokens: Nearly $5.7 million long FIL positions were liquidated on Dec. 16, according to Coinglass, while $365,000 in STORJ long positions were also liquidated.By Glenn Williams Jr.Bitcoin’s correlation with copper has been interesting to track, rising as high as 0.9 a week ago.

91,"Over recent weeks we’ve made a point of highlighting bitcoin (BTC) and ether’s (ETH) correlations with different assets, and the extent to which they’ve sustained or changed over time.That process, often referred to as intermarket analysis, aims to give insight into how one asset price might move, based on factors that impact another.The measuring stick is the correlation coefficient, ranging from -1 to 1. A coefficient of 1 implies a direct pricing relationship, with a coefficient of -1 indicates a completely inverse relationship.Bitcoin and ether, despite the differences in their blockchain consensus mechanisms, total supply and utility, have enjoyed a persistently strong pricing relationship, with a correlation coefficient above 0.9 for all of November and most of December. The coefficient now sits at 0.85, still extremely strong.Other correlations we’ve been tracking include bitcoin’s relationships to equities, metals, energy and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY):What stands out besides BTC’s reliable correlation to ETH is the persistently inverse relationship to the DXY.The 0.84 reading on Nov. 19 appears to be an outlier. BTC held an inverse pricing relationship with the DXY for the better part of 2022, turning positive between Nov. 9 and Nov. 27, but largely related to the FTX collapse.For traders, the consistently positive relationship between BTC and ETH, and the equally consistent inverse relationship between BTC and DXY, presents an opportunity should those correlations stray from their norms.While BTC appears poised to trade flat for the time being, a deviation in the relationship can be an opportunity – because correlations typically revert to their mean.Bitcoin’s correlation with copper has been interesting to track, rising as high as 0.9 a week ago.

92,"Price crashes and crypto collapses dominated headlines in 2022, but it was a year of significant progress for Bitcoin. In 2022, we saw how Bitcoin as a protocol allows for widespread innovation that fills whatever needs developers and entrepreneurs identify without any need for changes to that protocol. We’ve highlighted 10 important developments below.The greatest achievement in Bitcoin this year was, once again, Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin continued to operate flawlessly, with one block coming roughly every 10 minutes and its coin issuance precisely adhering to what was set out in Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper in 2008. There were no emergency restarts, no hard forks, no chain splits and no protocol-level hacks or bugs. Yet again, Bitcoin delivered 100% uptime and was available to anyone in the world all year in the face of everything 2022 threw at it. Billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin were transferred every single day on its blockchain.Bitcoin did all this without any foundation supporting it, without any direct employees, without any leaders or venture capitalists. As such, ongoing developments that rely on Bitcoin’s reliability and predictability were able to proceed with uninterrupted focus for yet another year and with the confidence that they’ll be able to do so for the foreseeable future.It is worth noting that none of the remaining items on this list require any changes to Bitcoin’s base layer consensus rules.While Bitcoin’s base layer remains rock steady, its most significant scaling protocol, the Lightning Network, experienced massive growth and development in 2022. Lightning Network allows for instant, cheap payments off-chain, eliminating the need to wait for a block to confirm transactions. It is entirely decentralized and permissionless and improves Bitcoin’s scalability while still leveraging the security and settlement assurances of Bitcoin’s base layer. The network’s publicly visible liquidity capacity rose from 1,058 BTC to more than 4,771 BTC in 2022.The number of Lightning Network channels rose by +80%, from 37,298 to 67,339 channels.The number of publicly visible Lightning Network nodes increased by +88%, from 8,295 to 15,636 nodes (though the rate of growth slowed in the second half).All told, the growth of the Lightning Network was astounding this year, driven by numerous wallets that were launched, better tools for users that were built, and more educational resources that were produced. Instant, cheap payments (typically under 1 U.S. cent) became widespread in 2022 as Bitcoiners looked to exchange value peer-to-peer over the Lightning Network.In 2022, El Salvador experienced the greatest country rebrand in history under President Nayib Bukele’s policy of economic liberty and Bitcoin. Bukele appeared on the cover of Bitcoin Magazine's year-end edition, which showed the president looking like the Founding Father of hyperbitcoinization, the first mover and the leader who dared to embrace Bitcoin-only and the economic liberty it offered to his people.Read more: What Is Bitcoin's Lightning Network? In the column, Bukele called for all Bitcoiners around the world to recognize that El Salvador's fight against the global elites is their fight, too. El Salvador’s embracement of the bitcoin currency made clear to all that it understands exactly what revolutionary money actually is, despite the FUD from mainstream media. While U.S. regulators and political elites got taken in by the likes of Sam Bankman-Fried, bitcoin led to boom times in El Salvador. Tourism numbers have skyrocketed, GDP is growing and the country keeps stacking sats.October saw the creation by El Salvador of the world's first “Bitcoin Embassy” in Lugano. This chamber of commerce will be headed by Salvadoran bitcoin miner and investor turned Bitcoin diplomat and “Honorary Consul” Josue Lopez. November saw the creation of the Bitcoin Office within the Office of the El Salvadoran President. The office was created to meet the growing demand for access and information from investors worldwide. The Bitcoin Office further establishes the El Salvador template for more nations to copy on the road to hyperbitcoinization. El Salvador closed out the year in the most bitcoin way of all – with President Bukele announcing that El Salvador would start buying one bitcoin every single day.This new service was coded in a few weeks by African developer, Kgothatso Ngako, who noticed a problem – most Africans have basic phones but don’t have access to a reliable internet connection – so he created a solution. Machankura enables people in Africa to receive and spend bitcoin via text messages without needing an internet connection. In a report from Caribou, 94% of financial transactions in Africa are made through text messages, and only 6% of these transactions are made via mobile apps. ​​This new service allows individuals throughout Africa to use bitcoin for the first time on technology that is already at their disposal. Projects like Machankura will help push bitcoin adoption in regions that need digital sound money the most.This year, Lightning Labs introduced a protocol proposal to Bitcoin and the Lightning Network that aims to allow for the minting, sending and receiving of assets on the networks. Taro utilizes Bitcoin’s latest protocol upgrade, Taproot, to enable the issuance of theoretically any kind of asset on the Bitcoin blockchain while still using the immutable verification of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Taro could allow for all kinds of assets like stablecoins, stocks, and bonds to be issued on top of the Bitcoin protocol opening the door for more use cases and more functionality on the network.Impervious Technologies launched the first web browser built on top of Bitcoin’s second-layer scaling system, the Lightning Network. It is a peer-to-peer web browser that offers a full suite of tools for communication, data transfers,and Lightning payments without any middlemen. This comes in the form of secure peer-to-peer messaging, P2P video calls, P2P workspaces, decentralized identity management, decentralized data storage and direct user monetization of their data. All of these tools are fully encrypted, and they remove centralized intermediaries that collect and sell the user’s data. By utilizing the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin and Lightning networks, Impervious Technologies has given us a hint of what the Internet will look like in the future.FediMint is a new method to custody bitcoin by forming collaborative custody communities to help secure each others’ bitcoin and protect privacy. This form of custody takes advantage of the inherent fact that humans trust those closest to them the most. It leverages technologies like federations and (David) Chaumian e-cash mints to cryptographically maintain privacy between the individuals of a group while also allowing them to share custody of the entire group’s bitcoin. This custody solution offers the possibility to scale bitcoin, improve privacy, lower on-chain fees and can get more individuals to take self-custody of their bitcoin around the world.Value-4-Value is a new approach to content publishing where the creator receives value after the “customer” enjoys the content, once again, through the Lightning Network. Over 10,000 content creators have already implemented Value-4-Value on their podcasts, and solutions such as LightningAddresses and Bolt-12 invoices, are making this possible for all other types of content, promising continued rapid growth in 2023.An informal Telegram group of ordinary people interested in running their own Lightning nodes formed and is about to cross over 5,800 members.Not only do participants provide support to each other on best practices, but community members have developed and released numerous open-source applications to make some of the most advanced capabilities of Lightning Network easily accessible to anyone. sdLightning Terminal is a browser-based interface for managing channel liquidity on self-hosted Lightning nodes, performing submarine swaps via the Lightning Loop service, classifying channels and integrating loopd, poold, and faraday daemon. Balance of satoshis makes it easy to balance channels, making it easy to issue lightning transactions that balance channels' inbound and outbound liquidity. LNDg and Lightning Jet offer similar capabilities with more advanced features for monitoring nodes and maximizing efficiency.All over the world, people live with very little, very expensive or no electricity. Bitcoin mining is changing all this. One example, shared by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, was powering a rural Kenyan village while securing the Bitcoin network with excess hydropower, all while lowering rates to 2,000 people (500 families) by approximately $10 a month to only $4.Far from being an isolated example, a further $2 million in the financing, led by Stillmark VC and Block, was secured in December to use bitcoin mining to increase energy access across Africa while further distributing and securing the Bitcoin network.",2022/12/19
93,"In the aftermath of cryptocurrency exchange FTX’s collapse last month, questions have swirled throughout the industry about whether other large players’ finances can be trusted. With professional auditors now abruptly exiting the space, those questions may keep lingering.Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, sought to tamp down worries raised by rival FTX’s rapid descent into bankruptcy court by announcing it would release proof-of-reserves data. While not conventional audits, such reports describe how much crypto an exchange is holding – an attempt to allay fears about the whereabouts of customers’ money.The Binance proof-of-reserves report did come out – only to be withdrawn Friday when the auditing firm it had hired, Mazars, announced it was no longer working with crypto firms. Mazars had also been working with Crypto.com and KuCoin.Mazars was one of a few auditors (along with Grant Thornton and BDO) working with unregulated and private companies in the crypto industry to assure transparency. Now even the French auditor has cold feet.“I’m quite surprised the public and regulators are finally discovering that their favorite centralized exchanges [CEX] have incredibly complicated layers of corporate structures and, as we’re finding out, un-auditable books,” said Joseph Collement, general counsel at Bitcoin.com.Mazars, in an email to CoinDesk, said it was pausing work with crypto clients globally due to “concerns regarding the way these reports are understood by the public.”Binance and many other crypto firms are privately held, meaning they don’t regularly – if ever – release financial data. So the short-lived proof-of-reserves information was welcomed by the industry.The now-withdrawn reports published by Binance and Crypto.com were often misunderstood as actual audits, that is unbiased examinations and evaluation of the financial statements of an organization. But they’re really just a matching exercise that involves mapping customer assets as recorded in an exchange’s internal database to entries in a public blockchain, according to Francine McKenna, a lecturer in financial accounting at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.This led to confusion in the industry and the assumption that those exchanges indeed had all the assets they said they had – which isn’t necessarily the case, because the exchange could have cherry-picked the assets that were checked by the auditor.In theory, it’s easy to audit proof of reserves, Collement said. “When a crypto asset is deposited onto an account earmarked for a specific user, the CEX should hold that asset 1:1 on behalf of the user.”However, very few CEXs adhere to those procedures, he said. “Once commingling of customers’ funds together or customer’s and company’s funds occurs, audits become extremely more difficult.”This is also because assets could be held in other cryptocurrencies as opposed to U.S. dollars, which adds another layer of complexity. In addition to that, “proof of reserves mean very little without proof of liabilities,” he said.This is a problem, because while these reports prove there are assets to support the market value of various stablecoins or reserves to back up customer assets, they don’t consider the creditworthiness of borrowers for loans that are included as assets. They also don’t identify and value obligations the stablecoin issuer or exchange may have to others that could wipe out the value of those assets.“Choosing to do any work, especially an actual audit, with crypto-adjacent firms is very high risk,” McKenna said. “I am not sure these firms fully assessed the risks of acceptance and continuance of these relationships to their reputation and legal liability.”Crypto companies for a long time have promised customers to publish audits regularly to provide a sense of security and transparency. Few have actually kept their promise, and most have argued that it is simply too difficult to find an auditor to work with.“Mazars is trying to reduce its risk profile,” said RA Wilson, chief technology officer of 1GCX. “Its team probably discovered that they’re understaffed and not as knowledgeable about the crypto industry as they need to be to conduct a comprehensive audit.”Mazars’ departure doesn’t mean, however, that conventional auditors cannot examine the books at crypto firms. Coinbase is a publicly traded company in the U.S., and so – as it must – the company releases full-fledged reports about its finances, audited by one of the largest accounting firms in the world: Deloitte.Top accounting firms like Deloitte “prefer to work with large pre-IPO or public firms,” McKenna said. “Partners who want to do something new or more risky are usually held back by lots of layers of checks and balances that manage liability for the firm.”Firms like Mazar or Grant Thornton, or Tether’s auditor BDO Milan, on the other hand, have seen an opportunity to carve out a niche in a new industry, she said.“I think this ‘pause’ by Mazars … will create a chilling effect,” McKenna said. “The fact that FTX had any audits means someone is starting to ask for more assurances. That has now grown to a very loud cry, and I doubt the Big Four [accounting] firms will step in and fill the void.”",2022/12/19
94,"Since 2016 I have ended each year with predictions for the blockchain ecosystem for the year ahead. 2022 has been one of the most tumultuous years in crypto, with a litany of decentralized and centralized entities already evaporated or on their last leg. It feels like we are in the final convulsions of a nascent ecosystem, expelling bad actors and bad practices in a dramatic but ultimately maturing process. Here’s what we’ll see on the other side.Andrew Keys is a venture capitalist and managing partner of DARMA Capital, a Commodity Futures Trading Commission-registered commodity pool operator and commodity trading adviser focused on quantitative systematic alpha of Web3 protocols. Prior to DARMA Capital, he was global head of business development for ConsenSys.When we look back at 2022 in 10 years, the real news wasn’t the idiocy of Sam Bankman-Fried and Celsius Network; it was that Ethereum shipped proof-of-stake and continues to be the most ubiquitous layer 1. A series of protocol-level developments has created a vortex of innovation, development, users and capital. In Ethereum we are witnessing the evolution of the substrate of humanity’s social, economic and political operating system.In 2023, Ethereum will continue to be the most widely adopted, widely developed and capital-heavy layer 1 blockchain. The Merge was the greatest event in the industry since Satoshi’s Bitcoin Genesis Block in 2009. More nuanced but equally important developments will launch on Ethereum in 2023, driving greater adoption and capital in a flywheel effect that will situate Ethereum as the leader in the next bull run.The next Ethereum upgrade after the Merge is Shanghai, planned for the second quarter of 2023. Among many upgrades Shanghai will enable withdrawals of ether (ETH) stakes, which have been locked in the deposit contract since staking was enabled in December 2020. The ability to un-stake ETH could increase the amount of staked ETH as stakers, who were uneasy with the idea of locking funds, come on board.Following the Shanghai upgrade, EIP-4844 is another Ethereum innovation that will further situate Ethereum as the most ubiquitous layer 1. EIP-4844 will enable proto-danksharding. Proto-danksharding is proposed as a step along the way to full sharding, and will help layer 2s scale. Danksharding is a sharding design that uses a “merged market fee” in which each shard has different blocks, but shares one block proposer.Read more: What Is Sharding?EIP-4844 is a proposal to start implementing elements of danksharding as the full danksharding design is still being developed. Though no longer in the Shanghai update, I predict proto-danksharding will be accepted and implemented in 2023, setting the stage for rapid development towards full sharding and maximum Ethereum scalability.After a smooth transition to proof-of-stake, Ethereum’s utility as a platform for staking innovation will continue to expand, creating a new compounding crypto yield curve.Following Ethereum’s successful migration to proof-of-stake in September, ETH is now the largest staked capital base of any blockchain, with more than $20 billion staked. Prior to the Merge, we saw innovation in the realm of staking through projects like Lido, which enables liquid staking, and Obol, which provides distributed validator technology.In 2023, we will see continued innovation in ETH staking as capital seeks more secure forms of yield and future updates enable stake withdrawals. EigenLayer is a particularly innovative staking project. EigenLayer provides crypto-economic “security as a service” to rollups, bridges and oracles. EigenLayer allows these projects to leverage Ethereum’s staked security to supplement or complement the security provided by a native token. In 2023, EigenLayer plans to launch its re-staking protocol and the first middleware using the re-staking mechanism, called EigenDA (Data Availability).An increase in ETH staking in 2023 will engender demand for more nuanced utility from validators, stakers, and projects built on Ethereum. Staking innovations like EigenLayer and others will continue funneling utility and capital into the Ethereum base layer, creating a flywheel of adoption and utility that will continue to establish Ethereum as the global settlement layer for Web3.The Fed will turn dovish, setting the stage for the next crypto bull market in Q3 2023.I predict the U.S. Federal Reserve will pivot away from its hawkish policy and stop raising interest rates by the second quarter of 2023. As we see credit card debt at notable highs and savings at notable lows, I anticipate we will see macroeconomic indicators like Brent crude oil fall to $60 – early 2021 levels – and shipping container rates fall below $2,000, which hasn’t happened since before COVID-19. Both of these signals indicate an economy in need of jump-starting, which will convince the Fed to ease off the interest rate hikes. This will engender a risk-on environment, incentivizing capital flows into more innovative industries like crypto. By this time, I also predict sufficient regulatory progress will be made in the crypto industry, meaning that the risk-on environment will be accompanied by clearer policies. Altogether, this will engender the next bull run beginning in Q3 2023.Washington, D.C., will be a crypto hotspot in 2023 as regulatory innovation proceeds at unprecedented rates.The centralized finance disasters of 2022 were the result of poor risk management, insufficient governance, incomplete audits, and potential fraud – all of which could have happened in any industry. Consumer protection will be top of mind for policymakers in 2023. The majority of emerging policy will be around centralized exchanges and stablecoins. Exchanges like Coinbase may be forced to be G-SIFI-regulated institutions, which will increase their regulatory compliance costs. Washington, D.C., will be the hotbed of some of the most controversial and important conversations about crypto in 2023.During this increase in regulatory attention, the Securities and Exchange Commission will continue to declare that all tokens are unregistered securities, which is categorically untrue. Just because this new database technology is able to digitize and tokenize any asset doesn’t mean all such assets are securities. We will see tokens representing everything: an electron on a microgrid, a bar of gold, a carbon offset credit, a software license, a governance right, a concert ticket, a doctor’s prescription, a meme that got very popular in 2010 and then everyone forgot, a fiat currency, and a reward point – none of which should rationally be lumped under securities. That isn’t consumer protection, [SEC chief] Gary Gensler, it’s willful ignorance of new technologies.If the U.S. rushes through poorly designed legislation under the guise of consumer protection, we will lose Web3 to the rest of the world – unlike how the U.S. won the Web2 revolution. A regulatory ontology should be defined to help everyone in the space determine whether a specific token should be classified as a commodity, security, or other type of asset.Banks chartered by the Federal Reserve will offer crypto services.The Financial Stability Oversight Council aims to further evolve regulations to protect consumers and enable greater technology innovation in an effort to build more robust and secure global platforms.An example of this is VaultLink, whose Digital Value Transfer Rail enables banks to offer crypto-asset services (custody, staking, exchange), digital value transfers and real-time payments in a regulatory-compliant manner with true supervisory oversight. VaultLink’s 2023 plans are to continue serving as a leading voice on the Federal Reserve’s Working Group while collaborating with the banking agencies to enable crypto services.NFT utility will grow more nuanced, personalized and commercial as we collectively move past the “jpeg” era. At the same time, blue chip “jpeg” NFTs will be a multi-billion-dollar asset class.In 2023, the Web3 ecosystem will move past the “jpeg” era of non-fungible tokens that dominated the last two years, represented by 10,000 pfp projects and zero-utility art. The term “NFT” will no longer automatically mean “digital art” as it has, since a variety of use cases will emerge, all using NFTs as the base technology.Already commercial behemoths like Starbucks are exploring alternative use cases of NFTs. Many more commercial leaders are watching how Starbucks will unfold; if successful, we will see a big bang of major brands releasing NFT rewards points. Web3-native projects such as Mojito have started this evolution, and are already powering both brands and creators that want to explore more personalized utility of NFTs. 2023 will also be the rise of “phygital” where a teenager who purchases a physical pair of Nikes will also have a digital receipt of those sneakers to be digitally worn on their avatar in the metaverse.This rapid evolution in the true utility of NFTs will force the crypto community to look back critically on the projects of 2021 and 2022. If they haven’t failed already, the vast majority of remaining NFT projects that haven’t evolved utility will join the NFT graveyard. What we’ll find remaining will be the blue chip NFTs that have been acknowledged but largely ignored in the last year – the CryptoPunks of the world.Investment DAOs will grow in prominence as decentralized, secure and transparent alternatives to investing through GP/LP venture structures.Investment decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) will grow in number and in prominence as transparent, auditable, and collaborative vehicles to deploy and allocate capital. Investment DAOs will force a shift in the mindset of financial decision making; instead of relying on the opinions of a few experts, these DAOs will operate based on the consensus of their global memberships via a “wisdom of the curated crowd.” As agile, on-chain entities, these investment DAOs will be some of the earliest players in high-potential investment opportunities, leveling the playing field for the average investor.Tribute Labs is an investment DAO building machine whose current network consists of 16 investment DAOs ranging across the Web3 landscape with assets under management of over $1 billion. These DAOs have set frameworks that will serve as blueprints for the emerging set of investments DAOs in 2023. Each DAO is limited to 99 members, striking a balance between a diversity of members and the relative ability to make quick decisions and allocate capital efficiently. Tribute Labs will introduce more DAOs in 2023 (AI, DeSci, Urbit and more), continuing to establish best practices and grow the impact of investment DAOs.Read more: 2023 Will Be the Year of Dapps – Here's What to ExpectFilecoin becomes a fully fledged layer 1 protocol in its own right, paving the way for the world’s largest decentralized data economy.In 2020, I predicted that IPFS and Filecoin would step into the global spotlight as a viable decentralized solution for data storage. Two years on, the Filecoin network has indeed expanded at breakneck pace, amassing an incredible amount of hardware to the network. It is now the largest decentralized storage network on Earth. More than 4,000 storage providers contribute ~16 exbibyte (EIB) of storage capacity. Client data stored on the network is up 15 times, year to date. That’s enough to store the entire Internet Archive 275 times over. That said, to be competitive with the centralized cloud, Filecoin will need to grow more than 10 times from here – still a long way to go, but a credible path.The vision for Filecoin has always been larger than storage. The project’s community has a steadfast commitment to the mammoth ambition of building the decentralized infrastructure required to enable programmable storage (via smart contracts), retrieval and large scale computation of data. In other words, Filecoin is enabling open services for data.The protocol is releasing smart contracts in Q1 2023 through the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), a critical on-chain upgrade which will allow it to come into its own as a fully fledged layer 1 protocol. The FVM will enhance the sophistication of Filecoin’s storage services while unlocking a whole new universe of use cases for the Web3 space. To date, other layer 1 smart contracts have focused on a few use cases: decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, gaming and so on. What makes smart contracts on Filecoin unique is the ability to pair these Web3 offerings with real world services like storage and compute, provided by an open market. I expect the Web3 space to eagerly anticipate the “coming of age” of Filecoin and explore building natively on the protocol next year.Reputation will re-emerge as a fundamental innovation in Web3 as a multitude of reputation projects launch.In 2023, years of progress on the decentralized identity and reputation front will finally come to a head. These systems will start to become critical pieces of infrastructure underpinning most of our interactions and transactions, especially in Web3. Soon you will be able to take your flawless reputation built on one application and apply it towards another. Decentralized identity and reputation systems make this possible by taking a more holistic approach to identity through platform-agnostic, user-centric data aggregation.Projects like Intuition are pushing the boundaries on the identity front – by incentivizing the attestation of interesting data points and incorporating these attestations into the “identity” derivation processes, Intuition is able to provide a more comprehensive view of “who” and “what” things are. This is essential in enabling humans to coordinate on a decentralized global scale.Prepare for the rise of “ZK everything” as privacy technology emerges from academic proofs-of-concept to usable, scalable technology.Zero-knowledge proofs rose to prominence in the past year, with one use case, ZK-Rollups, gaining visibility as the dominant tool for Ethereum scaling. In 2023, a much broader set of use cases will be unlocked by adoption of software development kits (SDK) that allow ZK smart contracts to be programmed into applications (“ZKApps”), executed off-chain, with verification and settlement back on-chain. Off-chain execution opens up a whole new world for data privacy and attestation, and efficiency. It will start to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, and will enable new identity use cases, social networking, voting, games and zkML.The lynchpin to the success of ZK in 2023 is access to existing Web3 devs. O(1) Labs – company behind the first succinct ZK-based layer 1 MINA – launched an SDK that will better enable the development of in-browser ZKApps in the year to come. These sorts of developments from 2022 will mean that in 2023 ZK will move from the world of academia and testnets into daily Web3 life. Moreover, teams like Matter Labs will roll out zkSync2.0 which is a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine that supports Solidity, Vyper and account abstraction.The zero-knowledge proving market will be larger than bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) market by 2030.Cosmos gets interesting as developers and users seek more customization. Appchains will also go live on Ethereum.In 2023, the “Cosmos vision” will finally find mass adoption. Cosmos is not a blockchain but a ‘“galaxy” of interconnected chains. Importantly, all of the chains employ the inter-blockchain communication (IBC) standard, a technology designed to mimic the early innovations of TCP/IP layer in Web2. For nefarious hackers, bridges have represented the most lucrative attack vector, totaling a whopping US$2.5 billion since 2020. Having a standard communication layer just makes sense.Moreover, as blockchains have matured in application, developers will be forced to welcome and own more of the blockchain stack. We will see a range of customizations. How much security does your chain want or need? Is it open for all developers? How about fees? Where do you want to be connected? The many chains approach makes these customizations possible and may unlock true product market fit.Appchains give developers the ability to customize execution environments in a way that smart contract platforms can’t support. The challenge is that appchains lose the shared security enjoyed by dapps. App-specific rollups (RollApps) get the best of both worlds and will be a big trend in 2023.Alongside the growth in Cosmos, however, we will see the rise of app-specific chains anchored by Ethereum. As the largest project in the blockchain ecosystem, Ethereum is able to take the best in open-source, and port it to the Ethereum community.Projects like Stackr Network are pioneering this wave of appchains through RollApps. Stackr offers a language-agnostic SDK for developers to customize optimistic rollups along with a decentralized sequencer network to run them in a trust-minimized way. The plan in 2023 is to build a developer alpha and onboard early projects. These projects will also help shape the design of the system through a closed feedback cycle.Bitcoin will face headwinds, continue to lose market share and will not lead the next bull market.Bitcoin will continue falling behind in the market as it succumbs to prevailing headwinds: primarily “pet rock” syndrome, environmental concerns and failure as “digital gold.”Bitcoin’s lack of daily utility will begin working against its favor as the rest of Web3 starts demonstrating real-world use cases. It will succumb to the “pet rock” syndrome, in which holding the asset won’t seem as attractive compared to directing capital to tokens and ecosystems with increasing commercial and enterprise use.Environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns will only rise with the macro-political and macro-environmental movement. Enterprises, individuals and governments will be under continued pressure to curb unnecessary energy consumption, and crypto is already under scrutiny. Environmental concerns are only one reason why Web3 prefers proof-of-stake, but it is a coincidence that will make PoS blockchains more resilient against ESG criticisms and regulation. Any remaining PoW chains must demonstrate clear utility to validate continued energy consumption. Bitcoin won’t transition to PoS and its utility will remain limited, setting it up to be the primary recipient of such criticism.Lastly, bitcoin had every chance to act as a risk-off digital gold-like hedge but failed to live up to that opportunity over several years. It acted like risk-on tech beta instead.Together, these three headwinds will put Bitcoin back even further in this bear market, setting the stage for another layer 1 with actual utility to lead the next bull run.Web3 gaming will move past its flawed, early projects and finally begin meeting gamers where they are.Web3 gaming has, for the most part, fallen short of its vision so far. The most “successful” Web3 games – for instance, Axie Infinity and DeFi Kingdoms – have been propped up as the future of gaming, but have failed to make an impression among the 3 billion gamers worldwide. In fact, Web3 gaming has received a bad reputation, characterized as little more than a money grab or DeFi with a veneer. This reputation has not been improved because Web3 gaming projects are highly connected to crypto markets.In 2023, Web3 gaming will shake off the habits of these earliest projects and start releasing projects that bring together the utility of Web3 and the aesthetics of traditional gaming. The next wave of Web3 games will look nothing like the Axie-style games of the last two years, and will begin resembling mainstream gaming aesthetics. Popular attention will shift away from token-first projects like Axie towards the studios, companies, and titles that have been building with a gameplay-first approach: Horizon, Animoca and others.As layer 1 protocols continue to undergo core developments in scalability and privacy, layer 2s will support the next wave of consumer-friendly applications.Despite breakneck innovation, the leading layer 1s still have sufficient protocol-layer development to undergo in order to support daily mass adoption of Web3 applications. Specifically, consumer requirements like scale, user experience (UX), confidentiality and security. The layer 2 ecosystem has been growing steadily over the past 18 months, with generalized networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism, and industry-specific networks including ImmutableX. The layer 2 ecosystem has had a couple of false starts but in 2023 we will see layer 2s come to the forefront of crypto adoption as they handle the wave of consumer applications coming to market. In particular, the nonfinancial applications like social media, gaming, and metaverses – which can reasonably prioritize scale over all else – will look towards layer 2s as the best solution to quickly launch in the market.Read more: Crypto 2023 – Full coverage Decentralized science (DeSci) will take center stage as another major use case of Web3, open-source collaboration and decentralized fundraising. DAOs will be at the forefront of the movement.In 2023, DeSci will turn scientific research into a Web3-native asset class through IP-NFTs (Intellectual Property NFTs), ushering a new age of scientific discovery comparable to the enormous breakthroughs witnessed in open source software development in the early 2000s. Fields like biotech will move from monopolistic innovation models to open-source, hyper-collaborative ecosystems where outcomes are more fundamentally aligned with patients and researchers.In 2022, organizations such as Molecule have brought IP from leading universities across the globe on-chain, financed and supported by novel decentralized biotech organizations, such as VitaDAO. VitaDAO is a BioDAO on Ethereum building a portfolio of longevity assets and working to bring these technologies to market in a community-driven way, like a FlamingoDAO for biotech. BioDAOs are communities that fund and incubate IP-NFTs, and are already seeing traction, with four new entities participating in a new accelerator program, bio.xyz.2023 will continue the rise of BioDAOs and IP-NFTs, as Fortune 500 organizations like Pfizer expand to cover more scientific fields and therapeutic areas.The remaining vaporware blockchains will finally lose their positions as “top” blockchains as even speculative money leaves their ecosystems.For years, vaporware blockchains like EOS and Cardano have remained among the “top” blockchains as measured by market cap (Cardano is in the top 10, EOS is in the top 40). These projects are still riding off of hype from their earliest days, having undergone almost no ecosystem development despite the breakneck innovation happening across the rest of Web3.In the current depth of the bear market, Ethereum is maintaining (roughly) $1 billion in volume every 24 hours. Compare that to Cardano’s ~$1M and EOS’ ~$100,000 daily volume. The bear market hasn’t been kind to any network, but EOS has the unique standing of being responsible for the greatest value destruction based on original fundraising against current value, at $4.2 billion lost. Neither chain is living up to the promises made to early consumers. In 2023, even pre-initial coin offering institutional investors and the earliest retail investors will lose interest. The death knell will toll for these vaporware blockchains as they finally lose the last remaining mainstream supporters under the undeniable lack of on-chain adoption.The growth in reputation projects, social networks, and decentralized identity will bring AML/KYC solutions down to the wallet level.In 2022, a number of tools emerged that explored the ideas of social networks, reputation, and decentralized identities. These projects included soulbound tokens, ENS, POAPs and Lens. This focus on reputation and identity will increase in 2023, alongside increased regulation and consumer protection for DeFi use (at least in the U.S.). Verifiable credentials will become the data standard for off-chain credentials and attestations, with a focus on free, cheap, and privacy-first options that can be selectively disclosed by users. Where will these solutions come to head? We will see the first iteration of scalable reputation systems built using tools such as MetaMask Snaps, DIDs and VCs.Prepare for more fallout.The turmoil we’ve seen in crypto since May 2022 isn’t over. There are still buried bodies to be found from the excesses and impulses of the past years. Many people and companies have succeeded in obfuscating their exposure, but won’t be able to do so for much longer. Ultimately good for the ecosystem, this will unfortunately mean more consumer money will be lost, more trust betrayed and greater outside criticism. Keep building for the future, but prepare for more fallout in the near term.In 2023, renewed attention will be paid to leading open-source development projects as a hedge against repeating past mistakes in crypto.2022 was a massively formative year for open-source, internet-native organizations. The breadth and scale of problems that the Web3 community chose to tackle using these new models grew by an order of magnitude, and the impact these organizations can make for everyday people is starting to become a major theme.As we’ve learned from cases like FTX, it’s far too easy for us to slip back into old habits and accidentally reinvent the same broken systems that centralize power rather than push it to the edges. In 2023, we’ll see more projects come to the conclusion that we need to take our own rhetoric seriously and start to make meaningful strides towards building open-source, community owned infrastructure; towards a world where digital public goods for any local online community can be provisioned in a mutualist way that strengthens trust rather than diminishing it or abstracting it. Two projects in particular will continue to define models of open-source funding and development: Gitcoin and Tea.xyz.Gitcoin – which has distributed over $72 million in grants – is launching a “grants suite” that will enable any group to seamlessly empower their community members to coordinate funding for projects that address their shared needs. The suite will consist of Passport – a zero-knowledge identity verification tool – and two new protocols: a funding allocation protocol and project registry protocol.Tea is a protocol that allows open-source developers to be remunerated for their contributions. Tea’s product suite includes a virtual environment manager, a universal interpreter, and a unified dependency manager. In the first month of launching its command-line interface, over 2,400 developers have starred in Tea's GitHub repository, making Tea’s community of over 16,000 developers one of the most rapidly growing groups on GitHub. In 2023, Tea will be building out its blockchain registry, license management and remuneration features.The media will abandon its search for gods and find rational voices in crypto.As major centralized finance (CeFi) and DeFi projects collapsed in the last year, so too did their founders and CEOs. These individuals had been ravenously propped up by the media, engendering misplaced trust by investors, companies and regulators. The media will need to face its misguided obsession with their crypto “gods” and seek out measured, rational voices in crypto. This will happen, slowly but surely, throughout 2023 as the true nature of more “gods” are revealed.Fortunately, these rational folks won’t be hard to find for those genuinely interested in reporting on the reality of crypto. These new and old voices – notably humbler than the ones of the last two years – are building for the long term, and should be at the forefront of how the media reports on the space.“Tech crypto” will become useful, replacing “money crypto” and setting the stage for the next bull market.In Bill Hughes’ November CoinDesk op-ed, he explains the difference between “tech crypto” and “money crypto.” Tech crypto is about “peer-to-peer computer networks where participants transact by interacting with globally accessible software.” Money crypto is about “buying, holding, lending and trading tokens as investable assets.”The past year has been dominated by money crypto in terms of popular adoption, regulatory attention, and consumer knowledge. Centralized exchanges have been the “beating heart” of money crypto, and the landscape of CeFi now has a microscope on it from regulators. The scrutinization of money crypto will result in the clarification of tech crypto as a related, but separate, field.Tech crypto in 2023 will become more and more useful through two trends: 1) the movement of capital from centralized to decentralized financial applications and 2) the rise of non-financial decentralized applications like DeSci, social media, consumer rewards and more. The result will be a growing foundation of Web3 (i.e., tech crypto) adoption rather than just token (i.e., money crypto) adoption. This will set the stage for the next bull market and help hedge against volatile market cycles in the future as more capital is kept in transparent financial applications rather than shadowy centralized alternatives.The “Great Decoupling” will accelerate, paving the way for stronger enterprise adoption of Ethereum.In 2023, we will see the “Great Decoupling” and the consequent acceleration of enterprise adoption of Ethereum. As explained by Paul Brody, the Great Decoupling is when “the value proposition of Ethereum as a computing platform for enterprises finally gets separated from the focus on the price of Ethereum and financial speculation.” The focus on Ethereum’s enterprise utility will unlock greater enterprise innovation, spearheaded by organizations like EY building privacy technology on Ethereum. EY (Ernst & Young) now has industrial privacy solutions that support complex business logic, payments and transfers that run on public Ethereum. In the coming year, while enterprises can expect to see demand for audit and risk management go up, they can also expect to see growth in supply chain, procurement, and carbon traceability applications.The world will understand the difference between CeFi and DeFi.The only creditors made whole during the disasters of 2022 were Ethereum-based smart contracts, like those on Aave, where Celsius and Alameda Research repaid their loans to access collateral they posted to borrow dollars. Smart contracts didn’t need to retain Kirkland & Ellis or John Ray III for their reorganization, there was no negotiation and the technology worked transparently without fail as intended. The macro consequence of all this for 2023 will be a greater understanding – by individuals, financial institutions, investors, and regulators – of the difference between CeFi and DeFi. The former is where transactions are subjectively intermediated by humans who are able to improperly tamper with the database. The latter are where transactions are trustlessly and objectively intermediated by math and computer science without manipulation.",2022/12/19

96,"Foundation Devices, a developer of Bitcoin-centric tools that include a hardware wallet, has raised $7 million in a seed round led by crypto-focused investment firm Polychain Capital.The announcement comes during a surge of interest in hardware wallets following the bankruptcy protection filing of centralized crypto exchange FTX, which held and misused customer funds.The funding will help Foundation Devices continue expanding its engineering and design teams and build products, with a near-term focus on software services, according to a draft press release provided to CoinDesk.Other participants in the round included new backers Greenfield Capital and Lightning Ventures and existing investors Third Prime, Warburg Serres, Unpopular Ventures and Bolt.Founded in April 2020, Boston-based Foundation focuses on products that make Bitcoin and decentralized technologies more accessible. The flagship product is Passport, a $259 hardware wallet that uses a camera and QR codes for more secure communication rather than a USB or wireless connection to the outside world.

98,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin was flat heading into Asia hours on Monday, though crypto analysts are warning that pressure from the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary tightening isn't likely to fade anytime soon.Insights: Proof of reserves isn't necessarily the best way to check a company's health.Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.Fed's Powell replaces SBF as crypto-markets bogeymanBy Bradley KeounNow that the most tumultuous phase of the aftermath of the swift collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange has passed, crypto traders are back to dealing with a familiar adversary: the Federal Reserve.The U.S. central bank’s campaign this year to squelch soaring inflation by tightening monetary conditions is again becoming top-of-mind for crypto traders, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell and top officials signaling last week that the stiff pressure might remain well into 2023.“While volatility-crushing fatigue has set in as the Christmas/New year interval approaches, markets will no doubt have to react to this in a bearish way, either with a slow bleed into year-end, or with another January/Q1 sell-off like we saw this year,” the crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Dec. 17 note on Telegram.Crypto markets were sedate over the weekend and staying flat into Asia trading hours early Monday, with the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) unchanged over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, was changing trading hands around 16,760, up 0.18% over 24 hours.According to Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at the bitcoin-focused investment firm NYDIG, investors remain “understandably skittish about the practices of exchanges, prop trading firms and lenders” given the industry events of the past six to nine months.The ongoing pressure from the Fed might “keep a lid on financial assets, including bitcoin, until we get some relief from the monetary policy backdrop,” he wrote in a Dec. 16 newsletter.Glassnode, the data and analysis firm, noted that “supply and demand dynamics show a lack of activity as investors remain wary following the demise of FTX and the FUD around Binance,” the world’s largest crypto exchange. “FUD” is an acronym for “fear, uncertainty and doubt,” and in the crypto lexicon it refers to pretty much any fresh information that tends toward the bearish side.“The outlook for bitcoin is not assured for the year-end given the great resistance above $18K, despite the continued seller exhaustion,” according to Glassnode.Proof of Reserves is useless without proof of liabilitiesBy Sam ReynoldsMazars, the auditing firm working with Binance and other crypto exchanges on proof-of-reserves statements, is pausing its crypto work for the right reason: It's not producing audits, as has been erroneously claimed. But for now, on-chain data is an excellent guide to see who’s really in trouble.Mazars announced Friday that it’s pausing work for crypto clients because what it’s producing is being misunderstood by the public. Almost immediately, the market panicked, pushing down Binance’s BNB token by almost 10%. It’s since recovered 4.6% over the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.Mazars is right for doing this. We shouldn’t be calling these reports audits, because they don’t contain a key element for any financial report – liabilities. But we shouldn’t be panicking either, because on-chain data is so far supporting the reported data from Mazars.There’s a far more interesting metric that we can retrieve via on-chain data that wouldn’t be captured in a Mazars report, which is quality of reserves. And this metric, which measures how reliant an exchange’s reserves are on its proprietary token, shows that Binance doesn’t have the issue some think it does.Data from CryptoQuant, which pioneered the metric in a recent report, shows that Binance’s reserves are 89% clean.In contrast, Huobi’s reserves of roughly $3 billion are 56.7% ""clean"", or to put it another way, 43.3% of its reserves are made up of its own exchange token. It's where our attention should be focused now, and not Binance, given that the exchange is the sixth biggest and does around $422 million in daily volume per CoinGecko data.To be sure, Binance is sometimes its own worst enemy and tends to add fuel to its own fire and encourage conspiracy theories and market panic. Binance is not doing much to help itself by temporarily suspending USDC withdrawals (other stablecoins remained open) and being coy when asked where its controlling company is located.All this comes as Huobi introduces a new burning mechanism to burn more of its token (think: buyback), thus increasing its value. Huobi’s HT token is down nearly 40% on the year, and it's now priced at $5.46, according to CoinGecko data. In a recent press release, Huobi said there was a 15.94% increase in the number of HT burnt in November compared to October, and this will increase more in the first quarter of 2023.“Huobi reserves have a highly risky setup at the moment,” Caue Oliveria, one of CryptoQuant’s author-analysts, wrote in a note to CoinDesk. “Tokens issued by the company itself are a risk to the company's net health, since it is difficult to sustain the veracity of the issuance of these coins.”Oliveria reiterated that FTX’s use of FTT to collateralize loans was one of its causes of failure, and Huobi is playing a dangerous game here.But CoinGecko co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Bobby Ong's take on the situation is more restrained. He told CoinDesk that we also need to know Huobi’s liabilities to get a proper sense of the situation.“If the exchange is not using its collateral to borrow money, it doesn't really matter what the clean reserves are. If every customer’s crypto is fully held 1:1 in proper wallets, it doesn’t really matter,” he told CoinDesk via Telegram. “What is more important is knowing the exchange's liabilities amount. Knowing the reserves is one part of the equation, but more importantly, what are the liabilities.”And those liabilities, for now, are a mystery. Huobi would not respond to emails asking for comment on CryptoQuant’s number or its liabilities by press time. While Huobi has posted its proof of reserves, missing from this report and many other exchange’s similar reports, are its proof of liabilities (hence why Mazars wants out of this business).“If an exchange has $1 billion in bitcoin liability, it better have $1 billion of bitcoin in cold wallet reserves backing this liability,” Ong concluded.In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Dips Under $17K; Binance Proof-of-Reserves Auditor Mazars Pauses All Work for Crypto ClientsFailed crypto exchange FTX is now looking to sell some of its acquisitions, including LedgerX.

99,"Last week John J. Ray III, the new CEO of FTX who is leading the company through bankruptcy proceedings, testified before the House Financial Services Committee about the crypto exchange’s collapse. I honestly don’t think there was much to report from Ray’s testimony beyond: a) the guy knows what he’s doing and b) that he believes FTX’s downfall was really just “old-fashioned embezzlement.”After Ray’s testimony I think most were excited to tune in to former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) scheduled testimony in front of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee. But that testimony was unfortunately canceled on account of the fact that SBF was arrested in the Bahamas after U.S. authorities filed criminal charges last Monday. SBF was denied bail and awaits an extradition hearing in 2023, for which he will wait while sitting in a maggot-infested Bahamian prison.You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) took the opportunity, with crypto top of mind, to react with a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) called the “Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act.” I’m not going to go over the bill point by point here but, if passed, the bill will require anyone who maintains public blockchain infrastructure to register as a Financial Institution (FI). This includes software developers or anyone validating transactions on a network.These FIs would be required to do things like collect the personal information of people who use their software and comply with anti-money laundering (AML) programs to block funds related to crime. On top of that, it would ban any interaction with privacy tools like Tornado Cash (which is sanctioned by the Treasury Department) and privacy-coin protocols including Monero or Zcash.On its face, the bill doesn’t necessarily feel problematic, especially because it was drafted in wake of the FTX collapse. But here's the thing about the bill: It misses The Point. The Point being that a lack of corporate controls and opaque systems led to FTX’s bankruptcy, not someone like me relaying bitcoin transactions with the computer sitting in my living room.The bill misses The Point because it goes after something only related to FTX because the word “crypto” is involved – like how soccer and baseball are related because they are both played with round-ish balls. But a rule in soccer that bans sliding into first base would be kind of … weird (non-sporty readers: There’s no first base in soccer).Proving this, Senator Warren tweeted:If you are paying attention, this has almost nothing to do with FTX. To be clear, I’m not coming to the defense of FTX here. But I am coming to the defense of people like Evan Kaloudis (no relation, although I have donated to his open-source project efforts) who will have to implement a sophisticated AML program for the ZeusLN wallet he developed – a piece of software which is free and open source – if this bill becomes law. Much emphasis on “free” here.On top of that, it is very critical to note that SBF was arrested without this bill becoming law, because he is charged with doing things – like securities fraud and wire fraud and money laundering – which are already illegal.The hoopla around this bill comes from the fact it is primarily focused on financial surveillance, which wouldn’t have stopped FTX from happening. In fact, the bill would make non-custodial use of crypto harder, which would drive users toward the FTXs of the world – not away from them.In all, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act is at worst a poorly veiled attempt at expanding financial surveillance, and at best it’s just a bill that misses The Point due to a lack of institutional crypto knowledge.Elsewhere, Twitter co-founder and Block CEO Jack Dorsey donated a touch more than 14 BTC to Nostr, a decentralized social network. Some Twitter users told him he should look into it and within 24 hours Dorsey funded developer fiatjaf’s Nostr efforts.Nostr isn’t itself a social network. Instead, it is an open protocol with a lean toward censorship resistance. The protocol doesn’t use a centralized server, instead relying on user-run clients. With this client, users can send content around by writing a post, signing it with their private key and relaying it to others’ servers. This relay network can enable others to build social media platforms using it.I think the donation is quite cool. But probably not for the reasons you think.You probably think I think it’s cool because ever since Twitter was taken private there has been an overwhelming sense that users are looking for a better experience and this is a step in the direction of improving that experience.Sure, that’s cool. But what’s cooler is that the funding of this project happened organically. Nostr wasn’t the brainchild of some well-known tech billionaire; it is just a piece of open-source software that was born because, as fiatjaf told me over Telegram, “the old internet where freedom [was] winning is being killed and new, supposedly free platforms won't work in the long run.”Whether you agree with fiatjaf or not on that point, Dorsey discovered Nostr, used it and thought it was interesting enough to warrant funding. So while it didn’t really garner attention until some well-known tech billionaire discovered it, it wasn’t that billionaire’s brainchild and that’s substantially cooler than if it was.Fiatjaf agrees, adding over Telegram that, “money isn’t really the most impactful thing, but the fact that Jack used it and talked about it is more important.”The parallels to Bitcoin are there (please do not take this as a suggestion that Nostr will be as big, important or successful as Bitcoin): Nostr is an open-source, decentralized protocol that people will try to use because they are dissatisfied with current systems. At a minimum, I really am looking forward to how the decentralized social media story continues to develop from here.Let’s tie the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act to Dorsey’s Nostr donation.While not targeted at all open-source developers specifically, if this bill passes then a meaningful cross-section of open-source developers may be tagged as potential criminals. So too will be the people who run and use the open-source software they develop. This tagging won’t stop everyone from using the open-source software, but it would certainly stop most people. This would in turn encourage broader use of large, custodial, centralized platforms like FTX.And while things like Nostr wouldn’t be covered in the passing of this bill, the bill still sponsors at least a partial muzzling of open-source software, the muzzling of which is a muzzling of free speech.In addition, with the funding of Nostr, Dorsey shows that he isn’t missing The Point.The Point is that spectacular failures in centralized systems (like FTX) beget the need to build robust, decentralized systems that protect liberty and freedom and everyday citizens. (As corny as that sounds, it’s true.) The Point is that centralization, in this case at least, is the issue.A natural conclusion here is that this bill would not protect us from another FTX or crypto money-laundering loopholes. It simply isn’t getting at the crux of the issue. I’m in no way suggesting that these senators are proposing this bill in bad faith; I’m only suggesting that the advertised purpose of a bill should be achievable given the laws that would be enforced in the event that the bill passes.So in the same way that I look forward to the development of decentralized social networks, I also look forward to the development of laws that make sense in the context of what they are governing.",2022/12/18

101,"We at Blockdaemon predict that the future of Web3 will be built on a foundation of seamless user experience: seamless use, seamless monetization and seamless governance. The success of any Web3 project is dependent on its ability to deliver this seamless experience to all users, including developers and enterprises within the blockchain space.We believe that blockchain-based solutions are the future of digital infrastructure. In order for them to take off, however, we need to ensure that the user experience is of high quality. This means that both users and developers need an easy way to access Web3 infrastructure and apps built on top of it.Friedrich ""Freddy"" Zwanzger is the Ethereum ecosystem lead at Blockdaemon, a leading independent blockchain infrastructure platform. This story is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 outlook.The work developers perform in 2023 will lay the foundation for the next wave of crypto adoption. This foundation will be based on the building blocks of cheap, modular, scalable and reliable blockchain infrastructure. The Ethereum protocol will serve as a manifest example to prove our point.We predict that this critical infrastructure, developed next year and beyond, will onboard billions of new users and hundreds of institutions in the future.However, this can only be achieved through great crypto products and use cases.The strong market conditions we’ve seen play out between late 2020 and 2021 revealed this need for solid infrastructure to support such applications.Unlike previous market cycles, 2021 saw large-scale institutional and developer adoption take place. Both financial institutions and decentralized application (dapp) creators needed a simple way to build on top of secure blockchain infrastructure.Many of the companies who built during the bull market will now struggle during the market downturn. This is mainly due to not having positive cash flow combined with insufficient treasury management skills.Well-thought-out, properly funded projects will survive and thrive during this crypto winter, while those that aren’t will struggle or fail.The Ethereum protocol is by far the most revenue-generating blockchain network. The Merge from the energy-intensive proof-of-work to the significantly more efficient proof-of-stake laid important groundwork for the future and in turn achieved 0% inflation since September, when the Merge took place..Over the past 20 years infrastructure services have dramatically reshaped the way online businesses are built.The dawn of cloud-based infrastructure radically reduced overheads for web companies. Consumers enjoyed faster, more responsive applications while developers could focus their time building innovative products.While the need for reliable blockchain infrastructure has technically existed since the introduction of Bitcoin, it is only relatively recently that builders have had access to the tools needed to support the growth of this decentralized future.Cloud infrastructure brought powerful benefits to the web. Blockchain follows the same deflationary route of other technologies, radically reducing costs associated with legacy systems. However, developing the killer apps of blockchain relies on the same high-quality infrastructure that Web2 enjoys.Such infrastructure support is needed to meet the growing demand for dapps, spanning complex needs across a wide range of use cases.However, projects in 2023 will need to focus and double down to set themselves up for later success, to meet these complex needs and use cases.This coming year will be a tipping point for crypto projects that are looking to position themselves well for the next wave of crypto growth.We predict that to excel under current market conditions, Web3 companies will need to focus on three core essentials:Companies must tighten their product offerings in order to win. This concentrates scarce resources, both time and money, on key value-adding areas.  It means knowing the market deeply and finding product market fit.Many large-scale institutional investors seek to invest in companies that are product oriented. Web3 companies should focus on building products that create better, seamless experiences for their customers using blockchain.Enabling withdrawals of staked ether (ETH) can be seen as such a feature and will be delivered to retail and institutional stakers alike around March 2023. It eliminates the previous capital lock-up on the Ethereum PoS network, thus eliminating the biggest point of friction.True long-term value is created when a company is a vertical domain expert across one (or many) of the rising categories of the future.A practical focus on product should fuse with a vision of what clients in the future will look for. By building value in these fertile fields, companies gain a powerful vantage point for the future. Being vertically integrated in key growth areas creates competitive moats.A company’s ability to create deep tech solutions in any one (or several) of these fields truly adds value to customers in the long term.History has shown us that companies with the right product offering can grow exponentially when the markets turn up.However, for blockchain businesses that experience exponential growth in a short space of time, it is very impractical to scale the physical node operations themselves. Service outages across popular blockchain platforms is a common occurrence during a bull market, which is equivalent to a power cut at a big retail store on Black Friday.What this means is that blockchain businesses must also prepare their infrastructure for that potential wave of customers that could occur at any moment, while managing the associated costs and overhead.Again, Ethereum serves as an example by scheduling EIP-4844 proto-danksharding in the fall of 2023 as a scaling solution for its thriving layer 2 ecosystem. Without taking sides on which of the layer 2 variations will be successful, the infrastructure enhancement will increase capacity by 10 to 100 times as an important step towards the 100,000 TPS goal.This coming year will be a time for building. When markets return, companies that take advantage of this time will be ideally positioned.The Holy Grail for the next wave of crypto adoption will be when customers use blockchain seamlessly, without needing to know or understand the underlying tech. Just as we use video calls without knowing the underlying protocol, VOIP, so too will blockchain become a frictionless, user-friendly and branded transfer of value and data. We’ll see social media giants incorporating crypto payments without users ever needing to know it’s blockchain behind the scenes.Ultimately, reliable access to robust and scalable blockchain infrastructure will make all of this possible.",2022/12/16

Statistically, prices stay within two standard deviations of its average approximately 95% of the time, so a move beyond either band is important to monitor.In trending markets, a move beyond an upper or lower band can signal a sharp price move in that direction. In markets similar in nature to the flattish one we’re currently experiencing, it can signal that prices have moved too far in one direction, and are poised to revert to the average.The sharp move down may provide a compelling entry point.",2022/12/16
103,"One of the founders behind OneCoin pleaded guilty to federal U.S. charges on Friday after one of the largest financial scams of all time, according to the Department of Justice.The purported cryptocurrency project was fraudulent from its 2014 beginnings, prosecutors said, with OneCoin – co-founded by Karl Greenwood – setting up a pyramid scheme to market it to millions of people, generating as much as $4 billion in revenue. Greenwood, 45, who allegedly called the investors “idiots” in an internal message, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money.“Karl Sebastian Greenwood operated one of the largest international fraud schemes ever perpetrated,” said Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. “Greenwood and his co-conspirators, including fugitive Ruja Ignatova, conned unsuspecting victims out of billions of dollars, claiming that OneCoin would be the ‘Bitcoin killer.’”Ignatova, known as the “CryptoQueen,” remains on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Most Wanted list as another founder of OneCoin, which was based in Bulgaria. The FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to her arrest.Williams said this case and other recent actions are meant to send “a clear message that we are coming after all those who seek to exploit the cryptocurrency ecosystem through fraud, no matter how big or sophisticated you are.”Greenwood, a citizen of Sweden and the U.K., had been arrested at his home in Thailand in 2018 and extradited to the U.S.Read More: OneCoin Co-Conspirator Frank Schneider Faces Money-Laundering Charges",2022/12/16
104,"There are hazardous gaps in how crypto is overseen, according to the latest annual report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) – restating a view that’s long been adopted by U.S. lawmakers, regulators and the industry itself.The FSOC – a panel of U.S. financial agency chiefs that includes U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the heads of several other regulatory agencies – met Friday to discuss risks to the financial system and approve the council’s annual report. While echoing the same widely held concerns about an inability to reach into spot markets for tokens that aren’t securities, the report shared another common position: Only Congress can give the agencies the powers they need to establish a full set of rules that covers the whole crypto industry.The report specifically recommended ""legislation relating to regulators’ authorities to have visibility into and supervise the activities of all of the affiliates and subsidiaries of crypto-asset entities.""Yellen said risks from digital asset represent one of the ""key priorities"" in this year's report.""We have seen significant shocks and volatility in the crypto assets system over the past year, including in recent months,"" she said.The FSOC was built as the ultimate lookout for future financial tsunamis after the global mess in 2008. Officials were quick to point out that crypto’s current troubles don’t pose any current risk to the traditional system during the meeting. The Treasury document illustrated that point with the fresh example of industry turmoil caused by the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, which left U.S. banking unscathed.""The problems at FTX precipitated price decreases in bitcoin and other crypto-assets, but thus far have had a limited impact on the broader U.S. financial system,"" the document noted.In a separate closed-door portion of the meeting, the regulators – including Gary Gensler, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Rostin Behnam, who runs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – discussed the recent crypto market dramas. According to a summary of that conversation later released by the Treasury Department, the members are watching those developments closely and ""spillovers to the traditional financial system have remained limited"" so far.""While the risks from the crypto markets generally do not appear to date to have spread to the traditional financial sector, we must remain vigilant to guard against that possibility,"" Gensler said in the open meeting. Already, he argued, the ""largely non-compliant market"" is putting individual investors at risk.The annual report also flagged a topic that could be considered a legacy of FTX: Its campaign to cut out the middlemen in clearing crypto derivatives trades, including the proposal that customers’ positions could be closed out by an automated system. The council called for a closer look at the dangers that concept might pose, even though FTX’s proposal to the CFTC was dropped by the company when it collapsed.The sentiments expressed in the latest annual report are similar to the much lengthier document released by the council in October at the behest of President Joe Biden’s executive order. That earlier report suggested Congress needs to soon pick an agency that will have power over the spot markets for bitcoin trading and any other cryptocurrencies that aren’t deemed securities. So far, most legislation favors the CFTC in that role.Read More: What’s Inside the FSOC’s Long-awaited Report on Crypto RegulationUPDATE (Dec. 16, 2022, 17:01 UTC): Adds details from the report.UPDATE (Dec. 16, 2022, 17:13 UTC): Adds congressional and FTX references from the report.UPDATE (Dec. 16, 2022, 17:27 UTC): Adds comment from SEC's Gensler.UPDATE (Dec. 16, 2022, 17:46 UTC): Adds comment from Treasury Department's readout on the closed-door session.",2022/12/16
105,"The pace of technological innovation in crypto finance is nothing short of astounding. Bitcoin, the “magic internet money” of yesterday, is now knocking on the doors of high street shops, bars and restaurants.The Lightning Network (LN), a web of interconnected nodes managed by crypto enthusiasts, is driving this revolution. LN transaction throughput and speed are already rivalling those of Visa and Mastercard for a fraction of the cost.Vlad Goryachev is a former Wall Street derivatives trader and structurer turned Bitcoin enthusiast. This article is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023.More and more retail establishments are thinking to start accepting “crypto,” but don’t know where to start. This guide will present and compare side by side all the available options for the business owners to make an informed choice.I’ll start by describing the solutions in alphabetical order and conclude with a summary matrix that could help retailers decide which to integrate. To qualify, each implementation must satisfy two criteria:1) Enable businesses to accept BTC payments via Lightning Network2) Do that face-to-face, (i.e., mom and pops and Box Top stores should be able to generate a Lightning invoice/QR code a client can scan to pay)Some of the solutions will present an option to automatically convert the proceeds into local currency, others will not. It will be up to the business owner to decide whether to hold bitcoin or do the conversions manually.See also: Move Over, Ethereum – Bitcoin's Lightning Network Has Apps TooI leave out of the scope other blockchains and stablecoins. In this day and age they are objectively inferior to LN as a payment rail.A U.S. company that offers a centralized wallet and bookkeeping suite with ability to accept a range of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin over the Lightning Network. To use it, a Lightning QR code is generated by the “BitPay Checkout” app linked with a users online BitPay account via an API code. Proceeds can be converted into local currency and withdrawn via ACH, SEPA, FPS, etc. Full KYC [know-your-customer] enrollment is required to start using the service. The company charges a flat 1% fee on the proceeds. Funds are at risk until withdrawn, because the wallet is centralized.Other notes: Only the iPhone version of this app existed at the time of testing. Trustpilot rated it at a 1.3.A free open-source app for iOS and Android that also accepts a range of cryptocurrencies, including Lightning bitcoin. Users can also send out remote requests for payment.To use Lightning, BitRequest requires a user to already own a Lightning node. The solution does not have access to private keys, therefore it is non-custodial (requires no trust in any third-party). Owning a Lightning node involves setting up and managing Lightning Network connections, or channels, to other Lightning nodes – a task that requires both time and substantial investment. To convert proceeds into local currency, the user would have to open an account on a crypto exchange (KYC route) or use non-KYC, peer-to-peer services like bisq.network or Robosats.A free and open-source app for Android that creates a non-custodial wallet and opens Lightning channels to a user's Breez node automatically (or to another chosen node). The first accepted payment, and each subsequent payment above 20 euro, bear a fee of 0.4% or a minimum of 2,000 sats, to cover channel opening costs. The channels get reused when money is paid out. The app does not offer conversion to fiat currencies, but can use any of them as a base to calculate the amount of sats for the Lightning invoice.Breez is currently in beta testing and users must accept a warning that their funds could be lost. For this reason I could not include it in the summary matrix. However, I do find this solution very innovative.BTCPay is a storied, non-custodial option that’s popular among crypto enthusiasts. The software code is free and open source and can be deployed through a variety of methods including a cloud or a local server. For example, one can install it with one click onto an Umbrel Lightning node running on a Raspberry Pi microcomputer. Such a server would be able to host a number of businesses (nearby shops and restaurants) all connecting to it via local Wi-Fi or cloud DNS. All of them, however, would need to trust the owner of the server. For users who do not want to set up and manage their own Lightning node there are cloud services like Voltage that allow renting for $10 per month. However, in this case the solution becomes custodial.This option is made by a Slovakian company, and offers a similar service to BitPay for 0.8% fee. The app, which only requires an email to use, allows automatic daily settlement in crypto or fiat to a personal wallet or bank account. Though, KYC is required for fiat withdrawals. When I tested the app, I found that the BTC/EUR conversion rate was an average of 0.5% higher than prices listed on CoinMarketCap. Further, the app did not show the exchange rate or data source. There is a maximum of 0.03 BTC (600 euros) set for invoices. Crypto withdrawals, including Lightning, incur a 0.5% fee and fiat withdrawals potentially incur “additional bank fees,” according to the Confirmo website. Funds are at risk until withdrawn. Trustpilot rating: 3.0.This subsidiary of the Slovenia-based company Eligma offers a physical POS device for 450 euros plus shipping cost as well as a free web version. Transaction fees vary by country, from 1.25% to 5%. Proceeds can be received in over 50 cryptocurrencies with optional conversion to fiat. Payouts are executed four times a month. Online onboarding is not available to test the service. Funds are at risk until withdrawn. Trustpilot rating is not available.A lightweight web app offering a “hybrid” solution. It is open source and free to use. The software is simply a gateway to a crypto exchange Bitfinex, but is separate from the crypto exchange’s “BFX Pay” platform. It can be run from LNPOS.me website or installed on the user's own server.See also: Bitcoin's Lightning Network Could Be Getting a Privacy UpgradeLNPOS works by requesting a Lightning deposit address from the exchange, and displaying it on a user’s phone or tablet as a QR code. Proceeds are automatically converted to a range of local currencies and stablecoins. Easy registration with email is available for testing. KYC verification is necessary to withdraw fiat. Bitfinex does not accept U.S .customers. Trustpilot rating: 3.2.This is a “Lightning LEGO set"" or, as the developers call it, a “Free Open-Source Lightning Accounts System with Extensions.” Much like BTCPay Server, it can be installed on an Umbrel node and activated using a TPoS terminal extension. However, to start accepting bitcoin payments, users need to also build or purchase a physical DIY POS terminal. This solution involves manual fiat conversions and, to remain non-custodial, a Lightning node you control.OpenNode is a registered corporation in Delaware that accepts Lightning payments and offers optional conversion to fiat. Upfront KYC is required. Weekly bitcoin withdrawals come with a 1% processing fee while on-demand withdrawals cost 1% extra for on-chain bitcoin (but are free for Lightning). Bank transfers charge a 0.2% fee in local currencies. Funds are at risk until withdrawn. Trustpilot rating: 3.0.The best non-custodial solution for a technically apt bitcoin investor is BTCPay Server. For a more cautious user, who would like to convert all incoming proceeds into fiat and has no desire to manage a Lightning node, the LNPOS.me web-app is a free alternative outside the U.S. For U.S. customers, OpenNode has better reviews.",2022/12/16

On Thursday, the exchange petitioned a U.S. bankruptcy court for permission to sell several subsidiaries, including FTX Japan, FTX Europe and Embed Business. ""Based on their preliminary review, the debtors own or control a number of subsidiaries and assets that are regulated, licensed and/or largely not integrated into the debtors’ operations, within and outside of the United States,"" the filing said. ""The debtors believe a number of these entities have solvent balance sheets, independent management and valuable franchises.""Crypto trading firm Amber Group changed its fundraising strategy to raise $300 million in a Series C round, as a reaction to the fall of FTX. The collapse of the exchange affected some of Amber’s products and customers, increasing the need to raise capital quickly. Amber decided to move from its efforts to raise a Series B+ round at a $3 billion valuation in favor of a Series C. ""Post the FTX collapse, we paused [the series B+ fundraise] after a partial closing and instead moved forward on Series C,"" the firm said.Bitcoin (BTC) was down 4% to just below $17,000 early Friday Eastern time, and ether (ETH) dropped 6% to $1,212 as more bad news in the crypto world keeps coming forth.

107,"The crypto market traded weak on Friday after French audit firm Mazars, which recently did Binance's proof-of-reserves report, suspended work for crypto exchange clients and global markets traded risk averse.Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell 2% to $16,950, extending a retreat from the one-month high of $18,300 reached Wednesday. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, fell 4.3% to $1,210, hitting the lowest since Nov. 29, CoinDesk data shows.Binance's BNB fell over 3% to $247, a level last seen on Sept. 26, and other major coins including XRP, LTC, and SOL registered similar losses.Mazars discontinued its veritas.mazars.com website dedicated to crypto audits in a move that probably highlights the prevailing discomfort among traditional institutions to associate with crypto projects.""Overnight crypto dump courtesy of Mazars and Binance worries,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted.Early this month, Mazars published Binance's proof-of-reserves report, showing the giant exchange's bitcoin reserves were overcollateralized. The report, however, did not provide details about the internal controls in Binance's margin and loan products, raising doubts about the exchange's health.Binance saw customer withdrawals worth several hundred million dollars as investors scrambled to take direct custody of their coins.Several observers have dismissed the uncertainty surrounding Binance as coordinated FUD, a crypto slang for fear, uncertainty and doubt.""Paid lobbyists and spokespersons are carrying SBF's voice and torch while he tries to change the narrative of the misappropriation of customer funds. As those attempts have been largely discredited, the attacks on Binance have intensified,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, wrote in a note to clients on Friday, referring to Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the FTX exchange.Investors in traditional markets sold risk, driving the U.S. stock futures lower and adding to the crypto market's woes as early this week, major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, pushed back against expectations for an early pivot to liquidity easing.At press time, the futures tied to the S&P 500 traded 1% lower, signaling a possible extension of Thursday's 2.5% slide.The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday said that while rate hikes could slow, more liquidity tightening is needed to control inflation, forcing markets to reassess expectations for rate cuts in the second half of 2023.The European Central Bank said it will raise interest rates ""significantly"" in the months ahead to combat entrenched inflation.""The ECB has been unusually clear in its pushback against market pricing.

108,"Things could soon go from bad to worse for bitcoin (BTC) traders looking for bullish cues on technical charts.The cryptocurrency's 50-week simple moving average (SMA) is falling fast and looks set to cross below the 200-week SMA for the first time on record.According to technical analysis theory, the bearish intersection of the two averages, often referred to as the ""death cross,"" means the market is about to head into a tailspin.Bitcoin has dropped 75% since reaching a record high of $69,000 in November of last year. The bear market has proved to be more intense than the previous ones during which sellers failed to establish a foothold under the 200-day SMA.Critics of technical analysis would point out that the death cross, irrespective of whether it occurs on the daily or weekly charts, is a lagging indicator and unreliable. That's largely true, as the indicator is based on backward-looking moving averages and reflects the asset's past performance.The death cross has a bad reputation for trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market in traditional finance. And it has done so to bitcoin traders in the past. For instance, the daily chart death cross of March 2020 marked a major price bottom.Seasoned traders, therefore, read the death cross in conjunction with other chart factors and fundamental indicators, which are split on the next possible move in bitcoin.Per Delphi Digital, bitcoin's sideways trading in the range of $16,500 to $17,300 in the aftermath of FTX's collapse offers little hope to the bulls.""We still believe this area does not have much structural support, and in the face of further contagion and uncertainty, we remain cautious as we watch the $9k-13k level,"" Delphi's strategists, led by Andrew Krohn, wrote in a note to clients.Several miners or those responsible for minting coins are likely to go bankrupt in the first half of next year, pushing bitcoin to $12,000 and below. Add to that the U.S. Federal Reserve's persistent anti-stimulus bias and the path of least resistance appears to be on the downside.That said, in the past, bitcoin has bottomed out to begin a new rally 15 months ahead of the mining reward halving, a programmed 50% reduction in the pace of supply expansion every four years.The next bitcoin halving is due in March/April 2024.

110,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin and the CoinDesk Market Index turned lower as traders started to rethink the takeaway from this week's Federal Reserve meeting.Insights: Ethereum had 192 active developers on Dec. 14, the highest number of developers among blockchain projects, data from Token Terminal suggests.Crypto sentiment makes quick reversalBy Bradley KeounIf Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting brought a buoyant mood to crypto markets, Thursday's action brought a reality check.Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value was down 2.6% over the past 24 hours, to about $17,400, tracking a similar trajectory in U.S. stocks.Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest overall, lost 3.6%, to $1,262. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) slid 2.4%. Optimism's OP token ranked among the biggest losers with a 10% decline.The take of CoinDesk markets analyst Glenn Williams Jr. was that the Federal Reserve, while slowing the pace of interest-rate increases, still has a long way to go before it can end its campaign to wring out inflation. Before price rises can moderate, the Fed will have to see a pretty significant increase in unemployment – to keep expectations of higher wages from becoming entrenched. Hopes of a quick reversal by the Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues might be premature. Funding rates – a key barometer of sentiment in crypto derivatives markets – are still pointing negative.By Sage D. YoungThe number of daily active developers working on top blockchains and decentralized applications (dapps) has decreased roughly 57% this year, according to financial data platform Token Terminal.In January, about 3,700 daily developers were active, compared to almost 1,600 on Dec. 14, data from Token Terminal suggests, which tracks daily totals.The decline has come as ether, the token of the Ethereum blockchain, and other cryptocurrencies have plummeted from record highs little more than a year ago. ETH was recently trading at about $1,300, down 64% from the start of the year when the second largest crypto by market capitalization was still hovering near $4,000. The number of projects built on the Ethereum platform over this period has plummeted as some projects have failed and increasingly risk averse investors have deployed their money at a slower rate than during 2021’s bull market.“It’s not surprising to see an overall decline in daily active devs,” said Chris Eberle, angel investor and contributor at Coordinape and PleasrDAO who goes by DeFi Ginger on Twitter. “2022 has been punch after punch for crypto. The impact to the market and the overall brand of crypto is just brutal.”Eberle noted that this year’s crypto debacles, including the recent collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX and failing of centralized lender Celsius Network, have created “one, big ball of pain” for the industry that has also contributed to the decline in active developers.With 192 developers as of Dec. 14, Ethereum currently has the most daily developers among blockchain protocols and dapps. Cardano and Cosmos rank second and third with 144 and 143 active developers, respectively. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently has 18 active developers.According to Token Terminal, Solana saw the largest reduction from roughly 2,500 devs in January to 75 developers at the time of publication, although the protocol insisted in a tweet last month that thousands of developers are working on the platform. “Something doesn’t add up, Eberle said. ""Solana fell off a cliff before [the FTX collapse].”He added: ”Others seem to have some dip but it could well be seasonal as we’re in the holiday zone now.”Token Terminal’s methodology to determine an “active developer” is based on the “number of distinct GitHub users that made 1+ commits to the project’s GitHub repositories during the past 30 days.”Overall, the number of the active developers in the crypto space has stabilized between 1,500 and 1,600 since mid summer, suggesting that a core of the determined, adequately funded people remain convinced of blockchain technology’s potential.4:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(8:30 UTC) Germany S&P Global/BME Composite PMI (Dec)5:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(9:00 UTC) Eurozone S&P Global Composite PMI (Dec)5:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(9:30 UTC) Great Britain S&P Global/CIPS Services PMI (Dec)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Top FTX Group Exec Tipped Off Authorities Prior to Bankruptcy Filing; Charges Pile Up Against Sam Bankman-FriedAs he sits in jail in the Bahamas, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried finds himself facing a litany of both criminal and civil charges.

112,"One interpretation of U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments this week is that, while he acknowledged the recent progress in bringing down inflation, material increases in unemployment might still be necessary medicine to stabilize consumer prices that were rising earlier this year at their fastest pace in four decades.The reality may have started to set in on Thursday as prices for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) moderated following Wednesday’s gains. Despite the increase in rates coming in slower, as expected, markets were seemingly caught off guard by Powell's hawkish commentary about the need to keep pressing forward, well into 2023.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed’s monetary-policy panel, released a fresh Summary of Economic Projections after this week’s meeting, including estimates for a 2023 unemployment rate that ranges from 4%-5.3%, up from the current 3.7%. The civilian labor force participation rate fell to 62.10% in November from 62.2% in the previous month. The civilian labor force participation rate is the number of employed and unemployed but looking for a job as a percentage of the population aged 16 years and over.So how is the latest Fed information dump playing in crypto markets? Sentiment for digital assets can be gauged in part by viewing BTC and ETH’s respective funding rates.Funding rates represent payments that occur on exchanges that facilitate the trading of perpetual futures contracts. When rates are positive, holders of long positions pay short positions. When negative, the opposite occurs. The extent to which funding rates are positive or negative can give a window into investor sentiment.Bitcoin’s funding rate recently dipped into negative territory, reflecting a shift to bearish sentiment. A look over the last month shows that funding rates have oscillated back and forth, unsurprising given uncertainty around BTC prices.Ether has taken a divergent path, showing positive funding rates for ETH during 14 of the most recent 16 trading days.The lack of agreement between the two assets is eyebrow raising because BTC and ETH prices are generally highly correlated. The discrepancy has not yet been realized in spot markets as the ETH/BTC pair has traded flat over the past month.So the sour taste of the medicine might be seeping into markets before it’s even administered.UPDATE (Dec. 15 20:55 UTC): Adds definition of the civilian labor force participation rate.",2022/12/15
113,"In the aftermath of the collapse of FTX, many are justifiably concerned about the solvency of crypto exchanges. Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent bucket shop may have been an outlier – court documents filed earlier this week by U.S. authorities allege that some $8 billion in FTX customer deposits were transferred to and lost by SBF’s “hedge fund” Alameda Research.But following a decline in crypto prices, a drawdown of debt between highly interconnected firms and several bankruptcy filings that have locked up billions worth of assets in legal proceedings, it’s reasonable to wonder if there is as much money held on centralized, largely unaudited crypto exchanges as there should be.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.This is part of the reason why users are taking possession of their own coins in recent weeks. Binance, the industry leading centralized crypto exchange, in particular has seen a significant drawdown in funds. Some of its largest clients, such as Jump Trading, have taken coins out, and the exchange moved to temporarily halt USDC withdrawals amid the surge (potentially to execute a token swap to its own stablecoin).See also: And Then There Was One – Changpeng Zhao – CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022Earlier this week, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao referred to this trend as “business as usual.” He also reportedly told employees to brace for a few “bumpy” months ahead. The exchange had published a so-called “proof-of-reserves” report conducted by auditing firm Mazars showing, depending on which figures you include, it was either over- or under-collateralized in its bitcoin holdings.Not to draw an unnecessary comparison to FTX, but CZ’s public comments this week are reminiscent of Bankman-Fried’s attempts to quell fears in early November amid a “run” on the exchange before it filed for bankruptcy protection. On Nov. 7, SBF tweeted that client funds were safe and backed by deposits – a message he deleted after it became clear FTX was deeply in the red. It’s a comparison CZ himself is drawing.“With Sam Bankman-Fried’s arrest, I think people generalize. So if you get hurt by one bank, you're gonna think all the other banks are bad. If one politician is corrupt, you think all politicians are corrupt,” he wrote. “But the fact is that because one bank is bad doesn't mean all the other banks are bad. And just because one politician is bad doesn't mean all the other politicians are bad.”This is all well and good – except that crypto exchanges are not, in fact, banks. As my colleague David Z. Morris notes, the term “run on the bank” has been misapplied when talking about recent withdrawals on crypto exchanges. The phenomenon is similar: withdrawals beget withdrawals, fears over insolvency can compound and become self-fulfilling. But unlike banks, users simply have to take it as a matter of faith that exchange operators haven’t misused or lost customer funds.Centralized crypto exchanges reintroduce an element of trust that trustless protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum remove from finance. Users take on the risks, even if rare, of hacks, frozen withdrawals and other business failures, Casa’s Nick Neuman said recently. And so, amid a period of uncertainty, Zhao’s primary responsibility is to reestablish confidence in his exchange.Binance has certainly made moves to keep funds on its platform. On Wednesday, crypto critic Bitfinex’ed tweeted a screenshot of a Binance offering to pay 50% APR on staked USDT, seemingly to keep assets on the exchange. Later in the day, Zhao took to Twitter Spaces to criticize self-custodying crypto, alleging that “99% of people … will end up losing” their funds if they have to be responsible for their own keys.This is no doubt a challenging time for Zhao. On Monday, Reuters reported the U.S. Department of Justice was nearing the end of a multi-year investigation into Binance – one of several ongoing probes into the firm from global law enforcement agencies. Federal prosecutors may ultimately charge CZ and other Binance executives with money-laundering violations, a risk that has accelerated withdrawals.His comments spreading fears about self-custody are entirely unjustified. Not only is it seemingly in allegiance with U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s recent Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act that would put unnecessary guardrails around so-called un-hosted wallets but also contradictory to Zhao’s comments just last month calling self-custody a “fundamental human right.”See also: Self-Custodial Onboarding Will Be the Norm in Web3's 2023 | Crypto 2023Rebuilding trust in Binance, stymying outflows, should not come at the expense of crypto’s principle innovation – enabling people to “be their own bank.”FTX’s collapse was a startling turn of fate for what was once one of the most-trusted crypto companies. Bankman-Fried has gone from being the industry’s J.P. Morgan to its Bernie Madoff. It’s an event that has caused irreparable damage to crypto’s public standing. Binance, too, has an outsized role in the industry – and hopefully it is not another FTX.But if Zhao has to make low blows to a fundamental attribute of crypto to rescue is own exchange’s reputation, then it deserves to fail. To take an old line from Zhao, “some things are better left unsaid. Recommend no more news like these, for the sake of the people, our industry (and your business).""",2022/12/15
114,"Asset manager CSOP says its bitcoin and ether ETFs have raised nearly $79 million as they debut today on the Hong Kong stock exchange.The fund manager launched new bitcoin and ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETF) that began trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Dec. 16, according to a press release. They will be the first listed bitcoin and ether futures ETFs available in Asia, according to CSOP.The launch is notable since the Chinese government officially banned crypto trading and mining in September 2021, though Hong Kong currently maintains an autonomous financial and legal system. The two new funds will be actively managed to invest in Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group)-listed bitcoin and ether futures to track their respective prices.“The approval of two new ETFs based on CME Bitcoin and Ether futures marks an important milestone for the digital asset ecosystem in Asia,” said Tim McCourt, CME Group’s Global Head of Equity and FX Products, in a statement.CSOP had previously launched Hong Kong’s first Metaverse ETF, which was listed on the HK Stock Exchange in February.The first bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds in the U.S. were approved last year, and while a number of spot bitcoin funds have been submitted for approval to the SEC, none have been approved thus far.ProShares' Bitcoin Strategy ETF, a bitcoin futures ETF launched in the U.S. last year, attracted more than $1 billion during its first two days of trading at the height of the bull market. In the year since it launched, the ETF has attracted inflows of $1.8 billion, and outflows of $619 million despite the underlying value of bitcoin declining by nearly 70% in the same time period.UPDATE (Dec 16, 3:03 UTC): Updates throughout",2022/12/15
115,"There is an uncanny sense of calm in the bitcoin (BTC) market despite lingering FTX contagion fears and macroeconomic uncertainty. Analysts are scrambling to explain the perplexing tranquility.Bitcoin's annualized seven-day implied volatility (IV), or the options market's forecast of a likely movement in the underlying asset, has declined to a two-year low of 38.2%, according to data source Amberdata.The metric – often equated with the degree of uncertainty or fear – peaked at 145% on Nov. 9 and has been falling since, even as the FTX contagion spreads and experts fear a wave of miner bankruptcies.To Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, the declining volatility is not surprising.""Volatility expectations will continue to drop. Lower volatility is one of my favorite trades for 2023,"" Thielen told CoinDesk. ""The macro outlook is extremely constructive, with inflation falling like a rock and the recent decline in oil making the Ukraine war less relevant.""Thielen added that the FTX headlines will now have less impact on the market, with investigations doing the dirty work in the background and cited China's recent decision to relax inflationary COVID-19 restrictions as a source of downward pressure on implied volatility.Negative headlines have had less impact on bitcoin's price of late. The cryptocurrency has risen 9% to $17,700 since crypto lender BlockFi filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 28. Dominant crypto exchange Binance’s health came under extra scrutiny early this week, with clients withdrawing large sums of their coins. Bitcoin has managed to eke out 3% gains for the week.Perhaps traders have moved on from the FTX collapse, having bought options to hedge their exposure following the FTX debacle, pushing implied volatility higher at that point.""Market participants have already hedged contagion implications, which are still relevant, but the hedging occurred when the market was in a more fearful state, leading the hedging costs to grow,"" Vetle Lunde, research analyst at Arcane, said.""The current low IV regime reflects that traders are satisfied with the current exposure (hedges already in play) and expectations of less volatility in the foreseeable future,"" Lunde noted.Options activity picked up pace in mid-November as traders bought ether, solana and bitcoin put options to hedge downside risks, while users with funds locked on FTX switched to trading futures on other exchanges.Or maybe crypto traders have just had their fill of 2022 already.Volumes in both spot and derivatives markets have crashed since then, indicating market stagnancy. That's typical of the pre-holiday season lull.Institutional interest has dwindled, as evidenced by the decline in active bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The so-called futures open interest has dropped to 69,000 contracts, the lowest since October.The share of non-exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the open interest has hit an all-time low of nearly 41%.""In the light of muted activity and expected slow times ahead, it's likely that volatility will continue to compress, which in turn is reflected in options,"" Lunde said.",2022/12/15

117,"Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume traded, is not the next FTX, according a report from CryptoQuant.The Seoul-based analytics firm points to on-chain data to support claims made in a recent audit that Binance is overcollateralized.“At the time Binance’s Proof of Reserves report was conducted, CryptoQuant’s estimate of Binance’s BTC reserves (liabilities) was 591,939 BTC. This compares to the PoR report’s Customer Liability Report Balance of 597,602 BTC. We can see that CryptoQuant data covered 99% of Binance's liabilities,” CryptoQuant wrote, using the ticker symbol for bitcoin. Collateralization is 101% when taking the exchange's assets and debtors into account, it said.Binance is not experiencing the same volume of outflows that FTX had in the days before its collapse, CryptoQuant wrote, citing on-chain data. While withdrawals have increased, they are small compared with the exchange’s overall reserves. In a tweet, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said he “welcomes the stress test.”Binance’s bitcoin reserves are up 4% since FTX's collapse, CryptoQuant wrote. Reserves for ether and stablecoins are down 6% and 15%, respectively.CryptoQuant points out that Binance differs from FTX-Alameda in how ""clean"" the reserves are, or, to put it another way, how they're not reliant on the exchange’s proprietary token, BNB. A CoinDesk report that showed FTX sister company Alameda Research was materially backed by the exchange's FTT token kicked off a liquidity crisis that ultimately led to its bankruptcy.For Binance, CryptoQuant says 88.95% of its reserves are clean. That compares with 56% for Huobi, 66.5% for Bitfinex, 81.64% for Kucoin, 97% for Crypto.com and 100% for OKX.Data from Nansen pegs Binance’s total reserves at $57.4 billion versus $3.04 billion for Huobi, $2.47 billion for Kucoin, $3.36 billion for Crypto.com, and $6.67 billion for OKX. Nansen doesn’t have data for Bitfinex.CryptoQuant says that Binance’s level of clean reserve is “acceptable.”While there have been some questions about the financial health of Binance, Hochan Chung, CryptoQuant’s head of marketing, points to the availability of on-chain data to corroborate all claims, even if you don’t trust the exchange’s published report.“Proof of reserve provides a real-time, transparent, and non-manufactured data, which is the first-time ever in the history of the financial market. The data is self-audited through blockchain technology,” he said in a Telegram message.What on-chain data can’t account for is corporate control. FTX was known for lavish spending on employee perks, such as luxury apartments for staff, a generous DoorDash allowance for food delivery, and a chartered aircraft to fly Amazon deliveries to the Bahamas from the U.S.""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,"" FTX’s new CEO, John J. Ray III, who was also involved in cleaning up Enron’s mess, said in a court document. ""From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.""Hal Schroeder, a former Financial Accounting Standards Board member and Rutgers University professor, told the Wall Street Journal that the audit Binance presented doesn’t comment on the quality of Binance’s internal controls.“In light of what we’ve seen in the Bahamas, I don’t want to conclude that all the systems are that good,” he said.Binance Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann recently tweeted corporate travel at company is more austere than at FTX.“Binance literally booked me at a Citadines ($83 a night) the last time I traveled to our Paris office.

120,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin rose early but later fell after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell damped enthusiasm stemming from a less-aggressive rate hike with hawkish comments.Insights: Is Dr. Copper's recent upturn a positive sign for bitcoin?Bitcoin Seesaws but Holds at $17.8KBy James RubinBitcoin looked primed to continue its momentum this week before U.S. central bank Chair Jerome Powell damped investors' mood with a pointed reminder that the Fed was not finished with its monetary hawkishness even after lowering its latest interest rate hike to 50 basis points.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $17,811, roughly where it stood 24 hours earlier. BTC had topped $18,300 earlier in the day following an unexpected slowing in November's inflation data and the Fed's anticipated dovish turn. But in a press conference following the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) rate announcement, Powell returned to a months-long theme that rising prices presented the biggest threat to the economy.“50 basis points is still a historically large increase and we still have some ways to go,” Powell said at a press conference following the FOMC statement.Ether followed a similar pattern, rising earlier in the day before dropping to trade at $1,308, down about a percentage point from Tuesday, same time. Most other major cryptocurrencies were in the red, albeit not by much with UNI, the token of decentralized exchange Uniswap, and LINK, the token of software platform Chainlink, falling 3.2% and 3.1%, respectively.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently sank 0.33%.Equity indexes troubled by Powell's comments closed down with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 off 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Tuesday's consumer price index fell to 7.1%, lower than the 7.3% projected by economists responding to a FactSet survey.The Fed's latest rate increase the federal funds target range to 4.25%-4.5%, the highest level in 15 years. Powell has signaled that the terminal rate – the peak rate for the current hiking cycle, expected sometime next year – will likely be over 5%. The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge each other to borrow and lend money.Meanwhile, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) are introducing a bill to crack down on money laundering and financing of terrorists and rogue nations via cryptocurrency. The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act would bring know-your-customer (KYC) rules to crypto participants such as wallet providers and miners and prohibit financial institutions from transacting with digital asset mixers, which are tools designed to obscure the origin of funds.Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, noted in an email that the current Congress, which is in its final weeks, is unlikely to pass the legislation, but that ""the Act would address some national security concerns as it requires crypto firms to play by the same rules that apply to banks and traditional firms.""'Dr. Copper' Offers Encouragement for Bitcoin InvestorsBy Glenn Williams Jr.Bitcoin’s correlation with copper, which moved into positive territory following the Thanksgiving holiday, has continued to rise.The increase is significant, given copper’s traditional link to economic health. Analysts often view copper as a proxy for growth, affectionately calling it “Dr. Copper” for its professorial ability to forecast trends. So copper doing well bodes well for the economy, which bodes well for bitcoin.Markets have been looking favorably upon copper, with the price of its futures contract increasing 8% over the last three weeks. If historic relationships hold true, this trend would imply market confidence about U.S. economic prospects.By contrast, bitcoin (BTC) has maintained a strong negative correlation with the U.S. Dollar index (DXY). Investors will be watching this index in the weeks ahead, particularly after the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) trimmed its interest rate hike to 50 basis points on Wednesday from its previous, more aggressive 75 bps increases.Still, Fed Chair Jerome Powell was unexpectedly hawkish in his comments following the rate announcement, reiterating long-held concerns about inflation.Will bitcoin follow Dr. Copper’s prescription or follow the lead of the U.S. Dollar Index?

BTC was trading as high as $18,356 right before the Fed’s announcement, over the $18,000 mark for the first time since early November. It’s up 0.5% in the past 24 hours. “Cryptos are getting dragged down as the dollar rallies with the return of risk aversion,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst of the Americas at Oanda, wrote in a Wednesday note.Equity markets also turned red, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closing down 0.76%.

A high volume node represents areas of significant price agreement, which often coincides with slower price movement.By contrast, low volume nodes represent areas of low activity.

122,"Bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK), lowered its year-end 2023 hashrate or computing power guidance to 16 exahash per second (EH/s), from 22.4 EH/s previously, citing delays in building a mining facility by one of its partners, Lancium.The miner announced a partnership with energy technology company Lancium earlier this year for an initial 200 megawatts (MW) of power capacity in west Texas, which translates to 6.6 EH/s of hashrate, with an option for an additional 300MW in the future.However, Lancium informed CleanSpark that capital constraints have affected its ability to meet its commitments, according to a statement. The expected completion dates have been pushed into late 2023 or even later, which led to the guidance cut by the miner.Crypto miners have been severely affected by the current crypto winter as the price of bitcoin has slumped, killing their revenue. Meanwhile, energy prices have soared, increasing their costs. This has resulted in one of the biggest mining data center operators in the U.S., Compute North, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September, while big players such as Core Scientific (CORZ), Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Greenidge Generation (GREE) have all said they are experiencing a liquidity crunch.In addition to the guidance cut, CleanSpark said that its fourth-quarter revenue rose 235% compared to the same period last year. Meanwhile, its net loss widened by 683% year over year, mainly due to the impairment of goodwill and bitcoin balances as well as non-cash charges due to modification of equity instruments, the company said in the statement.Shares of the miner have fallen 12% on Thursday, while the price of bitcoin also declined about 2%. CleanSpark's shares have fared slightly better than most peers, falling about 79% this year, compared to other miners such as Core Scientific (CORZ) and Marathon Digital (MARA), whose shares have declined more than 80% this year.Read more: Bitcoin Miner Core Scientific's Lender Wants to Give Miner $72M to Avoid BankruptcyUPDATE (Dec. 15, 16:09 UTC): Updates share price performance in the last paragraph.",2022/12/14
123,"Just after a better-than-expected U.S. inflation report had left investors in a good mood, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had to come in and spoil it.The bitcoin (BTC) price fell Wednesday as traders reacted to the Fed's signals that monetary-tightening could continue well into 2023, even as the pace slows.Instead of dwelling on the short-term retreat, investors might be better off focusing on the fact that, however briefly, they got a glimpse this week of a price trend resembling anything remotely bullish. It's something traders haven’t seen or even contemplated since the initial tremors in early November that ultimately led to the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange.Lingering fears of FTX-related contagion risk still permeate markets, while looming concerns about Binance’s reserves and stability have sprouted as well. Up to this point, bitcoin has performed poorer than normal in December, while leading into traditionally bearish January. Whether concerns about Binance are grounded in legitimacy or rooted in post-FTX fear could be clearer in coming weeks.In the meantime let’s unpack this week’s move up past $18,000 for the first time since Nov. 10. Does the move have real merit, or is it just a short term relief rally? It could be that – just the mere fact that we're asking the question is a sign for optimism.Historically, on a seasonal basis, the market is not entering a time of the year of strong performance.From a price-chart perspective, bitcoin’s roughly $17,900 level moves the asset into a “low volume node” region – possibly indicating the potential for quick price moves.Volume nodes can be identified as zones on a price chart using the Volume Profile Visible Range tool, showing trading activity by price point.

Bitcoin has now entered that same space, but to the upside this time around.The next high volume node appears near $19,100, approximately 7% higher than current prices.Momentum for bitcoin has jumped 23% since Monday when using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) as a proxy for measurement. The movement from 51 to 63 reflects an uptick in buying pressure while coinciding with an increase in volume.Now – the macroeconomic picture. Inflation concerns still linger, but they're moving toward less panic-worthy levels.As expected, on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point), after four consecutive 75 bps hikes.Powell's comments indicated that the U.S. central bank is committed to fighting inflation and can’t stop too soon, but that any changes to the underlying economic data will be evaluated.The tone was hawkish, and the market reacted accordingly.Bond market yields responded to Fed's comments with increased yields for two-year U.S. Treasurys, which maintains an inverted yield curve when set against its 10-year counterpart.The increase in short-term interest rates implies questions on short term economic prospects, and expectations for more aggressive Fed interest rate hikes.As market prices reflect future expectations for an asset’s prospects, the notion that we are a step closer to the end of Fed tightening is a welcome sight, even if that has yet to come into full focus.",2022/12/14
124,"Investment bank B Riley, one of bitcoin miner Core Scientific's (CORZ) top lenders, has proposed a new $72 million financing plan so the struggling company can avoid bankruptcy.""In our opinion, the vast majority of Core Scientific's issues are self-imposed and can be corrected in conjunction with an open, transparent discussion and ongoing participation with its creditors and equity holders,"" B Riley said in a statement. The investment bank, which has an outstanding loan of $42 million with Core, said that its proposed new financing will be ""on favorable terms, providing more than two years of runway for the company to achieve profitability.""B Riley said it is prepared to fund the first $40 million of the new financing immediately, with ""zero contingencies."" The remainder of the financing is contingent on all principal payments to equipment lenders being suspended at bitcoin prices of $18,500 and below. Above that threshold, however, free cash flow from operations will be distributed to equipment lenders.Read more: Bondholders of Troubled Bitcoin Miner Core Scientific Said to Be Working With Lawyers: ReportCore, which was the largest bitcoin miner by computing power, first warned of the risk of bankruptcy in late October, sending its shares plummeting about 80% on Nasdaq. In November, it reiterated that it may run out of money by the end of this year. Core Scientific is one of several miners struggling to keep afloat as rising energy prices increase costs, while stubbornly low bitcoin prices slash revenues. The company went public in Jan. 20 after merging with Power & Digital Infrastructure Acquisition in a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transaction.B Riley said that Core has about $300 million in total loans that have a very short maturity and were taken on by the miner during the peak of the crypto market. ""These debts were incurred as part of an aggressive, ill-conceived strategy by the company to continue to build out power facilities and expand miners while never selling bitcoin on hand and never hedging prices,"" the investment bank said in a statement.A culmination of these strategies has led the company to sell all the bitcoins in its inventory at a loss, which led the company to its current state, the bank added in its statement.The shares of the miners rose as much as 76% on Thursday but have fallen 97% this year, while shares of peers such as Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) have both tumbled more than 80% over the same time period.Read more: Bitcoin Miners’ FTX Contagion Exposure May Amplify Industry PainUPDATE (Dec. 15, 16:06 UTC): Updates share price performance in the last paragraph.

125,"The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point) as it continues to slow the economy and moderate price increases.The decision brings the federal funds target range to 4.25%-4.5%, the highest level in 15 years. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the terminal rate – the peak rate for the current hiking cycle, expected sometime next year – will likely be over 5%.Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by 2.5% since the 2 p.m. ET (19:00 UTC) decision, to around $17,740.Wednesday’s rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed’s monetary policy panel, signals a slowdown in the pace of hikes by the Fed, which for the past four consecutive meetings has raised rates in 75 basis point increments.“50 basis points is still a historically large increase and we still have some ways to go,” Powell said at a press conference following the FOMC statement.Inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) continues to slow on a yearly basis: November’s CPI report showed that inflation rose 7.1%, down from 7.7% in October, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.Officials with the U.S. central bank had said over the past month that it might be appropriate to slow the pace of interest rate hikes while the economy adjusts to the higher level of borrowing costs. However, ""ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate,"" according to the FOMC statement.The FOMC also released a new set of economic projections (SEP) and “dot plot,” representing top Fed officials' projections for the next year. Ten out of 19 central bankers who are part of the committee expect the terminal rate to be higher than 5% but lower than 5.25% by the end of 2023, the dot plot shows.For 2024, the majority of dots were put in the range of 4% to 4.25%, suggesting that rates will continue to stay elevated for a while.“The most important decision is no longer the speed,” Powell said, but rather for how long the Fed needs to stay restrictive until inflation comes down significantly, which he said will “be some time.”“It’s our judgment today that we’re not at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance yet,” he said.UPDATE (Dec. 14, 19:18 UTC): Added information about economic projections.UPDATE (Dec. 14, 19:47): Added comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.",2022/12/14
126,"In the early years, people left Wall Street for crypto because they believed in the future of this industry. It was fundamentally different from traditional finance. Then somewhere during the last bull run, the calculus changed. We started filtering candidates not on their crypto chops, but based on who went to Harvard or MIT or had high-pedigree parents.One of the first questions when you meet someone new used to be, “How did you get into crypto?” and the response would usually start with the year, followed by why they left corporate America to work at a startup for half the pay of Wall Street.Jenna Pilgrim is the managing partner of Mayflower Capital, a firm building teams in cryptocurrency and Web3. She has been building teams in the cryptocurrency industry since 2015, with tenures at the Blockchain Research Institute, Bloq and Streambed Media. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.Somewhere in the bull markets, we forgot this first-principle-based approach. We started filtering candidates based on their successes in Web 2 or traditional finance (TradFi), thinking they could easily learn the lingo of crypto enough to get by. We brought traders from Wall Street and entrusted them with huge books of tokens, assuming it would be the same. Derivatives are derivatives, right?I keep asking myself how the hell we allowed Sam Bankman-Fried and his band of new-coiners to get as big as they did without sharing our same set of shared values. I’ve resolved that it comes down to a failure of contextual understanding of where we have been, and where we as an industry would like to go.If you build a company with a CEO who only cares about making as much money as possible at any cost, you’ll attract talent who think the same. If you build a company that doesn’t care about privacy or decentralization, guess what? Your teams won’t care about that either. One largely overlooked feature of the FTX debacle is their diversion – and in some cases complete rejection – of the collectively created first-principles. Organizations like the Chamber of Digital Commerce and the Blockchain Association have been working for more than 10 years in Washington, D.C., to educate and advocate for sensible regulation. Then in 2020, Sam comes out of nowhere and starts speaking for all of us?I got into crypto in 2015 because I believed we could build a better, fairer system that worked for everyone. We started this to get away from centralization and blind trust of people and institutions. The first successful companies were built with people who believed in a few founding principles, all to varying degrees: decentralization, privacy, self-custody, and removal of middlemen. Don’t trust, verify. Can’t be evil. The list goes on.Read more: Who's Who in the FTX Inner CircleWe, the community of investors, users and crypto natives, allowed SBF to build FTX in a vacuum that didn’t follow these shared principles. FTX was notorious for not playing well with others, for bribing talent with equity and tokens, and for using influencer feedback loops to bewitch retail investors (not to mention regulators, lawmakers and journalists) who didn’t know better.FTX built a team all made up of new-coiners, teaching them to mainline his Effective Altruism ""kool-aid"" until their blood ran blue. That talent base obviously couldn’t be trusted to build sensible decentralized systems because, well, they had never built them before. They were missing the industry exposure and understanding that only comes from salty wounds of the past. I wouldn’t be surprised if most of the employees of FTX leave the crypto ecosystem altogether without a second thought. Honestly, the rest of us wouldn’t miss them.Crypto hiring is a fundamentally flawed process. We as an industry are (commercially) about 10 years old. We have a few things figured out by now: custody, wallets, block explorers, price indexes. The list goes on. We haven’t quite got lending and yields right, but there’s still time. Ten years of battle scars means that there are people who have direct experience in these areas, but somehow they aren’t getting to the jobs they know how to do.Someone who spent five years in crypto after five in investment banking is a far superior candidate to someone who spent 20 years at JPMorgan without having ever touched crypto at all. My least favorite statement to hear as a recruiter is, “I’ve been following the space for a while ...” I’m sorry, no. A candidate like that wouldn’t have the foggiest idea how to approach risk or compliance or custody or cross-border payments for their international customers.There is no substitute for the lessons learned in an early stage crypto company trying to secure basic bank accounts.There is no substitute for knowing how to receive investor dollars in USDC and manage a crypto treasury.Read more: 'A Complete Failure of Corporate Controls': What Investors and Accountants Missed in FTX’s AuditsThere is no substitute for knowing the cause/effect of a decentralized community being divided on an issue, and what a hard fork would mean for their business.There is no substitute for understanding the knock-on effects of a hard fork after a hack.You get the gist. At some point we shouldn’t have to watch this movie again.The thing the two aforementioned candidates differ on is context. Context can never be undervalued when it comes to building a principle-driven team. Stop it with the non-contextualized tradfi converts, please.I have heard time and again, “They’re in HR, they don’t need to understand crypto.” Well yes, they do. Human Resource managers need the same industry context that hiring managers have, if not more, because they need to span across disciplines and job functions to filter the right candidates. Their process needs to be ideology focused, not competency based.Many job postings aren’t reaching the right audiences because no one fits the mold of a traditional profile. Most crypto people didn’t go to an Ivy League school or graduate top of their class. They mined ether (ETH) in their dorm rooms in college or maybe even bought drugs on Silk Road (or its successors) with bitcoin (BTC). They blogged in 2014 about the failures of the modern banking system. They traded their way to moderate success on Kraken and KuCoin and learned about short squeezes from GameStop and Robinhood. They learned what custody was by losing their crypto on a defunct exchange. Sorry, there are no effective filtering metrics.The first question in a job interview at a crypto company should be along the lines of:“What is money?”“What is decentralization?”“Why does bitcoin matter?”“Do you own any form of cryptocurrency?”“Do you know what a wallet is, and do you have one?”We need to recognize our own bias and get off the job description high horse. We need to spend our days meeting as many people as we can, through the people we already know. We need to trust those around us to verify and vouch for good talent, then just give it a shot – regardless of whether they meet our bogus idea of what we think we need.We have to get crypto people back to work.Teams that grow using this human-first strategy are more resilient, initiative-driven and make better decisions. Companies foster a collectivist culture where people understand their role in the company, and the companies’ responsibility to foster the growth of the whole ecosystem. Employees are happier too, because they don’t feel they are working in the world alone.The community of crypto leaders have been very vocal over the last few weeks about what should have been done better and what we can do next time. Putting the too-little-too-late narrative aside, the biggest thing we can do now is back founders and hire teams who share similar fundamental ideologies to crypto itself. We must educate everyone in the company about these ideologies so decisions are centered around the success of the whole ecosystem, not just the success of one entity.",2022/12/14
127,"Remember the halcyon days of DeFi summer? Bitcoin was roaring, the Grayscale arbitrage trade was wide open, the basis trade was just getting going, traditional finance (TradFi) interest rates were plummeting and the broader public started to realize that a fully liquid 10% on stablecoins looked pretty darn good compared to the 0% offered in their savings accounts. Maybe we couldn’t point exactly to what was “alpha” in that spread, but numbers like that allowed us a fair amount of leeway in deciding that “this is a better way.”Alex McDougall is president and CEO of Stablecorp Inc. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023.In these early days, decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized finance (CeFi) were yielding similar rates and there had never been a default in the industry because all loans were far overcollateralized and there was real economic value in posting bitcoin (BTC) as collateral and borrowing stables or fiat. Liquidity was also well matched because all loans were “open term” and any redemption requests could be met by liquidity on hand or calling back loans. I wrote a year in review article for this very series in December 2020 that I still stand by, mostly outlining why the industry worked based on the above dynamics.Smash cut to today’s smoking wasteland of shattered dreams, shattered trust and near-zero yields. What happened? Was any of it real? Most importantly, what’s next?Let’s spend the minimum amount of time on what happened because, honestly, it’s relatively simple, and the bad actors and details will be extensively documented in court cases for decades to come. The (criminally) short version:Read more: Crypto 2023: It's Sanctions Season | OpinionVery little in digital asset yield land is truly “new.” Most of the lending models that were “created” or popularized through the rise of DeFi are actually just more public versions of models usually executed deep within gigantic financial institutions – securities lending being the main one.However, in the zeal to dispense with links to Tradfi, the fundamentals of operating those models – asset liability matching, correlation and contagion risk, collateralization models and robust underwriting models – got left by the wayside. While blockchain technology makes the operation of these pools and models much more transparent, effective and efficient (whether CeFi or DeFi), these are not technology platforms. They are financial risk trading engines, and the finance part of DeFi cannot be forgotten.Trust has been shattered in the digital yield space. Platforms that have gone through bankruptcies or have cut off liquidity will likely never recover, and this will leave a very long lasting impression on those looking to redeploy into this space. The “I pay you 12% and you don’t ask questions” model is gone for now (although never say never …). The first step in creating new models is a step function improvement in transparency. It has always been shocking how opaque lending platforms have been in an industry as transparent and “on-chain” as blockchain. Fortunately, because of that very same transparent nature of blockchain, quite a bit of knowledge can be gained about loan books, volumes and liquidity from an outsider’s perspective, simply by monitoring on-chain flows from known wallets.Going forward, there will be a significant amount of pressure on purely CeFi companies to disclose more information about their loan books and asset deployment strategies. There will also be a greater use of on-chain analytics tools to bootstrap that transparency where it is not forthcoming.There is also an entirely new model that has sprung up around this desire for transparency, colloquially known as “CeDeFi,” which refers to CeFi-style lending using DeFi rails. With this type of platform you have (mostly) the same level of transparency as a DeFi platform (i.e,. you can see the full loan book in real time including named borrowers) as well as any collateral posted and some summary risk scores on the borrowers. Borrowers are underwritten by “pool delegates” – third parties who do the diligence and also stake “first loss” capital into the pool to align incentives.See also: Where Is the Ethereum Virtual Machine Headed in 2023? (Hint: Beyond Ethereum) | OpinionOne critical evolution in this space has been the bifurcation of two schools of thought and action around collateral. Collateral, particularly in DeFi, has always been used as a hack or replacement for underwriting. You don’t need to underwrite a borrower on Compound if they are posting 150% of ether (ETH) that will be liquidated at 120%. However, at the same time, it was constantly acknowledged that collateral was inefficient and exclusionary by nature. To participate in DeFi, you needed to already have assets to post as collateral, and with overcollateralization you are by definition taking assets out of circulation.Before the meltdown, the truly institutional lending desks already had quite sophisticated underwriting processes for their counterparties, and the ones who followed them generally stayed out of the news. Now, with the increased push in transparency, underwriting practices are coming to light like never before, and with increased default data it is becoming possible to battle test these models and begin to build legitimacy.There have been other novel structures that have sprung up in the lead up to and in the aftermath of the meltdown to help manage the tail risks associated with this type of relatively new exposure.The first is DeFi insurance such as Nexus or Unslashed. Effectively, DeFi insurance acts similarly to any other insurance policy where an event happens and you are able to file a claim for compensation. Except instead of an insurance company underwriting and selling you the policy, it is an insurance pool that you are buying insurance from and the providers of the capital are other participants on the platform. If you put capital into a pool and it is bought out as insurance on the other side, you cannot remove your capital until either someone else puts in new capital or an insurance policy is cancelled. In this way, all policies are always fully reserved with assets. These platforms are new and they are certainly not Lloyd’s of London, but they do work. With the UST depeg there are now myriad case studies of users covering their risks via these insurance policies.The second is tranching-type structures like that employed on Idle Finance. Idle employs a methodology where it takes exposure to underlying CeFi and DeFi yield generating pools (and CeDeFi pools) and tranches the exposure between a junior and a senior tranche that are priced differently. The idea is that in a loss scenario the junior tranche is eaten away first before any losses are passed onto the senior tranche. To a certain extent, this type of tranching plays the same role as collateral in that there is a support system of assets pledged to the senior tranche that is eaten up first.When everything is transparent and written out in code, platforms become infinitely “composable” and it becomes possible to build optimization layers or additional incentivization layers on top of other platforms. Morpho Labs is a great example of this. It takes the core engine of platforms like Compound or Aave and enhances the matching engine to turn it into a P2P network that both increases yields as well as decreases borrowing costs purely by improving the technology instead of stepping up any risk or duration curves.Finally, it’s crucial to examine the current reality and build models for resiliency. TradFi yields are now routinely higher than what is available in the arbitrage-driven digital yield space. This likely won’t always be the case but it may be for some time. So breaking down those barriers between the structures able to access arbitrage-driven yields and those accessing TradFi yields, particularly “risk-free” type yields, becomes an extremely valuable source of advantage for the next generation of digital asset yield products.Setting a risk and yield floor with the TradFi market and opportunistically seeking to enhance that yield with composable, optimized, underwritten, appropriately collateralized, insured, transparent digital yield solutions is what will bootstrap this next generation of yield platforms.Finally, it will take time to rebuild, but don’t quit on the yield space. There will be more arbitrage, there has been exponential infrastructure progress, there is more and more data to train appropriate risk models and there are more and more innovative ways to manage unique and tail risks inherent in the space. The first inning ended with a fastball to the shin, but crypto has survived utter devastation before and the yield industry will rebuild itself faster, more efficiently and more composable than before.",2022/12/14
128,"Indians have lost interest in trading on local crypto exchanges since the government began imposing taxes on profits and transactions, data from AppTweak and SimilarWeb shows.However, interest in Binance, the world's largest exchange by trading volume, has remained more or less constant. The exchange is not based in India and thus is not subject to its jurisdiction, even if its users are.Visits to Indian exchanges Wazir X, CoinDCX, CoinSwitch Kuber and ZebPay fell 80% between Feb. 1 – when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government announced a 30% tax on crypto profits and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on all transactions – and Oct. 31, according to SimilarWeb. App downloads fell 93%, AppTweak shows.The tax on crypto gains kicked in starting April 1 and was set at the same level as taxes on earnings from online casinos. But the industry was hit harder by the second tax, which took effect July 1 and was aimed “more for tracking transactions,” Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.“The real killer has been the 1% TDS on each transaction,” said Ajeet Khurana, a crypto analyst and founder of Web3 platform Reflexical. “Because effectively this tax tells people not to transact. This has dampened sentiments the most.”While trading volumes crashed as much as 70% on Indian exchanges days after the imposition of the tax regime, the data shows website traffic for Binance remained more or less constant from June.As for downloads, by July 22 – around three weeks after the start of the transaction tax – unique installations of Binance overtook all Indian exchanges.“Effectively we have gifted volume to Binance,” Khurana said. “People will feel compelled to trade on international exchanges such as Binance because Binance will not implement the TDS.”The move isn’t necessarily indicative of tax evasion, Khurana said. A notification from the income tax regulator said residents are supposed to calculate and file taxes themselves when an international exchange doesn’t implement TDS because it doesn’t fall under Indian jurisdiction.In response to Parliamentary questions from opposition member of parliament Vivek K. Tankha on Tuesday, Pankaj Choudhary of the Finance Ministry said it does not register foreign crypto exchanges, and the same tax rules apply to anyone trading crypto irrespective of whether the exchange is registered in India or abroad.The response also revealed that the government earned $7.3 million through TDS since its implementation.""The amount of tax earned by the government shows that the actual net volume of all the exchanges combined is around 6,000 crores ($727 million) in Q3 2022 which is way below as compared to 2021, when the crypto market witnessed a massive bull run,"" said Shivam Thakral, CEO of Indian exchange BuyUcoin.The “poorly designed 30% capital gains tax on crypto assets and sledgehammer approach of 1% TDS on exchange-traded transactions coincided with [the] global rout in cryptocurrencies to kill Indians' interest in cryptocurrencies,” said Subhash Garg, a former secretary in the Finance Ministry’s Department of Economic Affairs.That’s evident not only in transactions but also in interactions with mobile platforms.

About a quarter of the conference was dedicated to the topic of “Latin America: Unlimited Potential Blockchain Land.”Read more: Paraguay Votes Down Crypto Regulatory Bill in a Blow to Crypto Mining IndustryArgentina’s BitPatagonia and Paraguay’s Penguin Digital were invited to present, while Yiding (Fred) He, Bitmain’s director of business development, talked up the region’s potential, although he cautioned that it’s important to find the right partner to work with in Latin America.Bitmain itself is looking into opportunities in the region, as are many other major firms.The availability of cheap electricity in Europe, North America and former Soviet countries has dried up this year, partly because inflation and the war in Ukraine are driving up energy prices and partly because regulators and grids are hitting the brakes on mining as they assess what effects it has on their communities.Read more: Canada's Manitoba Province Enacts 18-Month Moratorium on New Crypto MiningAs a result, companies were looking at Latin America, a region that still has untapped energy potential. Paraguay, in particular, boasts a relatively low price of under five cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) and as low as 35 cents. Many industrial miners in the U.S. are facing prices over that.But Paraguay’s national grid operator and the government have asked miners to pay as much as 60% over the industrial price of electricity. A bill to stop that plan was voted down in the Paraguayan legislature on Dec. 6, meaning miners’ margins will be far thinner than what they had calculated before.Meanwhile, high energy prices have already thinned out miners’ margins around the world, leading to some high-profile liquidity crunches.In previous conferences held at exotic locations, participants would often take meetings in the pool, or at least by the pool, and take time to catch up before getting to business. But this time, meetings were far more serious, and miners were bringing to the table printed financial presentations to now-scrupulous financiers, one attendee remarked.The mining industry has been hit hard by the crypto winter. Miners’ direct exposure to flailing companies like bankrupt crypto exchange FTX appears to be minimal and mostly through intermediary companies such as crypto lender bankrupt BlockFi and others. (That is with the exception of Celsius Network, a bankrupt crypto lender that was operating a mining arm.) But they have felt the effects of the crypto winter as much as anyone. Miners’ revenues have declined massively, along with the price of bitcoin (BTC), while energy prices have been soaring.Big companies in the mining industry like Compute North and Core Scientific (CORZ) have been affected, along with smaller firms that face higher energy prices. Few, like CleanSpark (CLSK), have been in a position to take advantage of the situation to buy distressed assets.During the last dinner in Cancun, closed to most attendees of the event, Micree Zhan, co-founder and chairman of the board at Bitmain, unveiled the price of a special batch of new S19 XP Hyd. mining machines. The price was planned to be $19 per terahash (TH). But Zhan, speaking with a hoarse voice, decided on the spot to lower it to $18.5/TH in light of the revelations about FTX and how the market reacted. (Terahash is a measure of computing power.)Read more: Bitcoin Miners’ FTX Contagion Exposure May Amplify Industry Pain",2022/12/14
130,"While bitcoin and stock investors are cheering Tuesday's softer-than-expected U.S. consumer price index (CPI) print, one expert suggests slowing inflation is not a reason to buy risk assets.The CPI was 7.1% on an annual basis in November, slower than a Refinitiv consensus estimate of 7.3% and down from October's 7.7% reading. Core inflation, which strips the volatile food and energy components, dropped to 6.0% from 6.3% the month before.The data, which strengthen expectations for a slowdown in the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest-rate increase path and a pivot to liquidity easing in second-half 2023, lifted risk assets. Bitcoin jumped over 3% to $18,000 following the CPI release, the highest since Nov. 10, CoinDesk data shows. The S&P 500 gained 0.7%, while the dollar index dropped to a six-month low.Optimism stemming from an assumption that once the Fed turns dovish institutions will again have access to cheaper money may be premature, however. Slower inflation often portends a decline in earnings per share (EPS), a barometer of corporate profitability. And that usually weighs on stocks and zaps overall risk appetite in financial markets. Bitcoin has moved in lockstep with equities since last year.""Those who find a lower inflation print a good opportunity to buy risk assets should look away now,"" Andreas Steno Larsen, founder and CEO of Steno Research, noted in the inflation review published Tuesday. ""Remember that the PPI (and the CPI, for that matter) is a leading indicator for EPS ... And if we allow the oil future to predict PPI, then we are in for negative EPS growth already during Q2/Q3-2023,"" he wrote, referring to the producer price index.The PPI measures the average movements of prices received by domestic producers for goods and services sold on the domestic or international market. The U.S. PPI follows oil price movements closely and serves as a leading indicator for CPI.""This is NOT priced into expectations for equities. A revisit of the 3500-3600 should be on the cards for S&P 500,"" Larsen said. The benchmark U.S. stock index closed at 4019.65 on Tuesday.The chart shows PPI will likely turn negative in the second quarter of next year. The projection is based on the price of oil futures.Historically, EPS growth has closely tracked the PPI, meaning corporate profitability could take a hit in the second quarter, putting downward pressure on risk assets.",2022/12/14
131,"The past year in the digital asset market has been characterized by a series of negative shocks, triggered initially by the collapse of Terra/LUNA, Citi (C) said in a research report Monday looking back on the year.“Leverage, volatility and interest have faded as investors battle with declining prices,” analysts led by Joseph Ayoub wrote. “Retail interest has broadly diminished as prices have declined,” and this has “coincided with a more general decline in volatility.”Institutional interest has also declined. This “loss of trust” followed the failure of many centralized entities, and is reflected in exchange-traded product (ETP) flows, which have remained negative throughout the year, the report said.Against a broader macro backdrop of inflation concerns, rising interest rates and tightening financial conditions, total crypto market cap has declined by about 61% compared to an 18% drop for the S&P 500 index, the report added.The bank says the bankruptcies of crypto exchange FTX and lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital were failures of centralized entities rather than decentralized entities, “perhaps signifying the resilience of decentralized finance protocols.” Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on a blockchain.Bitcoin open interest saw a significant decline, the note said. It started the year at more than $23 billion and has dropped to around $9 billion. Leverage has also largely declined. Open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts held by investors and represents active positions.The bank notes there is still over $150 billion in market cap across stablecoins. This type of cryptocurrency saw only 5% net redemptions in 2022. However, relative declines show different investor behavior and diverging confidence in stablecoins, with tether (USDT) losing as much as $10 billion in market cap, while USD coin (USDC) stayed roughly level and Binance USD (BUSD) increased.Spot trading volumes have remained resilient despite falling crypto prices, and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes have grown in recent weeks following the collapse of FTX. The demise of FTX has “further bolstered policymaker calls for crypto regulation, placing a greater emphasis on consumer protection,” according to the note.Read more: Goldman Sachs Sees Gold Outperforming Bitcoin in the Longer Term",2022/12/14

Bitcoin gained 3.7%, hitting $17,805.Bitcoin recently hit a one-month high earlier this week ahead of U.S. inflation data, and its dominance has cracked 41%, CoinDesk previously reported. Digital assets are generally rising as traders expect the Federal Reserve to slow down its inflation-fighting interest rate hikes.""This is the main trigger in the increase in prices,"" Raphael Kim, the founder of Seoul-based crypto VC Reframe, told CoinDesk. Kim said the lower-than-expected data in the CPI was a relief to many traders, who are building a post-FTX investment narrative.Many other tokens on the CoinDesk 20 were up during the Asia afternoon trading session, in particular those associated with layer 1 tokens including Avalanche (AVAX0, up 7.3% to $13.69, Solana (SOL) up 7% to $13.94, and Cosmos (ATOM) up 6.9% to $9.92.Data from CoinGlass shows that traders who held short positions have faced immense liquidation pressure over the last 24 hours. In total, $119.51 million in positions have been liquidated, with 83% of them being shorts.Meanwhile, Binance’s exchange token, BNB, is up 4% to $274.Nansen data shows that the netflow to the exchange flipped positive during the last 24 hours to $715 million. During the Tuesday trading day outflow hit nearly $2 billion over regulatory concerns and news that the exchange was temporarily suspending USDC withdrawals.Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, Binance founder and CEO, tweeted that he welcomes the “stress test” and suggested that all centralized exchanges should have similar regular tests. While the exchange doesn’t appear to have a liquidity problem at this time, CZ has warned staff to expect “turbulent times” ahead.Data from Nansen shows that Binance currently has reserves of $57.4 billion. OKX, the next exchange on the list, has reserves of $6.7 billion, while Crypto.com, in third, has reserves of $3.4 billion.",2022/12/14
133,"The outlook for risk assets appears bright after Tuesday's U.S. inflation report that affirmed the expected slowing of the Federal Reserve's liquidity tightening.Bitcoin (BTC), however, could remain under pressure because several miners are likely to go bust, overshadowing improving macroeconomic conditions, according to investment giant VanEck.""Bitcoin will test $10,000-$12,000 in Q1 amid a wave of miner bankruptcies, which will mark the low point of the crypto winter,"" Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, said in the 2023 outlook.This year, bitcoin miners, or those responsible for making coins, have been caught between rising operational costs and falling bitcoin prices.Miners' profitability is closely tied to bitcoin's price, given they receive the cryptocurrency as a reward for solving complex mathematical puzzles to verify transactions on the blockchain. The rewards received are often liquidated to fund operational costs.And so, when the price crashes, as it has this year by 61%, it leads to miner capitulation – a situation where weak miners exit the market, selling their reserves and causing the price to drop further. In a worst-case scenario, the capitulation could lead to a death spiral.Miners have been running down their coin stash to cope with adverse market conditions. Data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shows balance held in miner wallets has declined by over 25,000 BTC (US$444 million) since July, hitting a 14-month low of 1.818 million BTC.The trend could continue as most companies engaged in mining are bleeding cash.""The MVIS Global Digital Assets Mining Index median market cap is now only $180 [million], with nearly all constituents burning cash and trading well below book value. With bitcoin mining largely unprofitable, given recent higher electricity prices and lower bitcoin prices, we predict many miners will restructure or merge,"" Sigel wrote.A drop to $12,000 would mean an 82% drawdown from the record high of $69,000 registered in November 2021. The previous two bear markets ran out of steam at roughly 85% drawdowns from the the-then record highs.Sigel expects bitcoin to bounce back to $30,000 in the second half of 2023.""Lower inflation, easing energy concerns, a possible truce in Ukraine, and a turnaround in M2 supply will power the start of a new bull market,"" Sigel noted, adding that an oil-exporting nation would add the cryptocurrency to its sovereign wealth fund.VanEck also expects financial institutions to tokenize more than $10 billion in off-chain assets and a new decentralized stablecoin to reach the $1 billion market cap.The investment giant also sees Brazil becoming one of the most crypto-friendly countries of the world and tokenizing a portion of sovereign debt offerings on blockchain, Ripple losing the Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit in the U.S. and Ethereum enabling withdrawals from the Beacon Chain.",2022/12/14
134,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin and other cryptos liked the sound of inflation slowing by more than expected in November.Insights: The South Korean city of Busan wants to be a blockchain hub, but it is forgetting a few inconvenient truths.Inflation Slows, Bitcoin AcceleratesBy James RubinFormer FTX boss and crypto wunderkind Sam Bankman-Fried went to a Bahamian jail, was denied bail and verbally pummeled at a congressional hearing by the executive who replaced him as the exchange's CEO.Binance saw a torrent of withdrawals hours after a report that U.S. prosecutors were considering criminal charges against the exchange. Shares of crypto-friendly bank Silvergate plummeted to a two-year low.The digital asset industry had a memorable 24 hours, though not for the reasons it would prefer.Yet, crypto markets only had eyes for encouraging inflation figures from November.Bitcoin was recently trading at $17,765, a 3.2% gain over the past 24 hours, as investors embraced the latest consumer price index (CPI) data, which showed prices rising 7.1%, lower than the 7.3% projected by economists responding to a FactSet survey. The CPI soared over 9% earlier this year.“It’s pretty clear that the back of inflation has been broken,"" Jacob Sansbury, co-founder and CEO of Pluto, a provider of DIY automated investing services for retail investors, wrote to CoinDesk. After all, CPI prints are trailing indicators.""Sansbury added: ""This is an auspicious sign for bitcoin and crypto, along with other risk assets. I’m not saying that a bottom has formed yet fully for the crypto market, but from today’s lower-than-expected CPI print, it’s pretty clear that a bottom is very, very close.""Ether was recently changing hands at $1,319, also up 3.4% from Monday, same time. Most other major cryptos had a solid green hue with AVAX, the token of base layer network Avalanche, and LINK, the token of software platform, Chainlink recently rising 5.8% and 3.2%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently climbed nearly 2.4%.U.S. equity indexes embraced the encouraging CPI figures more quietly as the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 climbed 1% and 0.7%, respectively. The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday also showed core inflation, which excludes more volatile food and fuel costs, increasing 6% versus expectations of 6.2% and offered additional evidence that the U.S. central bank's monetary hawkishness during the past six months has been working.U.S. Treasury yields, which hovered above 4% just a few months ago, sank to 3.5% on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Fed is likely to raise the interest rate 50 basis points (bps), a decline from its streak of four straight 75 bps increases.Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried was remanded to custody and will face an extradition hearing on Feb. 8, 2023. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York unsealed the indictment earlier on Tuesday, announcing that officials were charging Bankman-Fried with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and campaign violation allegations, among other alleged crimes. FTX collapsed last month after CoinDesk found irregularities in its balance sheet.In a Tweet on Tuesday, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao wrote that he welcomed a “stress test” of withdrawals on his exchange to address rising user redemption requests from the platform.Of cryptos' Tuesday price surge, Bob Ras, co-founder of exchange and digital asset ecosystem Sologenic, noted cautiously in an email to CoinDesk that the bounce was not ""as substantial as many had hoped for.""""This isn’t to say there won’t be more upside for major crypto assets here soon. It’s certainly possible, if not likely,"" he wrote, adding that the emergence of China from its Covid lockdowns, could affect inflation in the months ahead.""There’s just too much uncertainty for a full-blown market breakout for crypto assets and equities that are further along the risk curve,” he wrote.By Sam ReynoldsThe South Korean city of Busan seems hell-bent on being a blockchain hub. But will anyone care about its government enterprise blockchain initiatives and quest to build the first city-run crypto exchange?Part of Busan’s status as the ""center of a global digital information ecosystem,"" as government literature describes it, is to integrate blockchain technology into all facets of government service. That means, according to The Korea Herald, that blockchain will be the technology that powers the city’s blockchain-based ID service called B-Pass, B-Fresh, its seafood logistics service, B-Tour, a tour platform, to name a few.The problem is this initiative represents yesterday’s thinking on blockchain. Others have tried integrating permissioned enterprise blockchain into digital infrastructure, and it has failed. A few weeks ago, CoinDesk reported that two major enterprise blockchain projects were ending: Shipping giant Maersk and IBM abandoned TradeLens, a blockchain solution for optimizing supply chains, while the Australian Stock Exchange said it was abandoning a blockchain-powered clearing and settlement system because of a poor cost-benefit ratio.“It’s a Web2 business model, but a little bit of Web3 pixie dust sprinkled on. And once the pixie dust kind of wears off, the value proposition doesn’t look so hot,” Paul Brody, head of blockchain at global consulting giant Ernst & Young, told CoinDesk in a previous article.This is on top of IBM’s blockchain team being effectively wound down in early 2021, and Microsoft discontinuing its Azure cloud services for blockchain a few months later.It isn’t exactly clear how the powers that be in Busan will do anything differently that could change the equation on enterprise blockchain. It’s probably that they can’t.The reason why there hasn’t been a success story in this field is that the technology itself is slow compared to other database platforms.“The problem was the cost in computing power to implement. Blockchain technology is slow and requires a great deal more computer power. Blockchain is the Model T of distributed ledger technology. They are amazing but now dated,” explained Burke Files, a consultant, when asked about why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration isn’t implementing blockchain technology as it once claimed.Busan’s other blockchain venture is the creation of a government-run crypto exchange. In a recent announcement from the city, authorities said that the project had some setbacks, but its still on track for a launch next year.Setbacks indeed. FTX was an early contractor on the project, but that’s obviously not going to work now that the exchange has collapsed and the former CEO has been arrested.Binance and Huobi are also involved, but there’s been little to show for what should be a very simple project.Even if it's built, will anyone want to use it? There will certainly be benefits for traders when it comes to Korean won on-ramps and expedited know-your-customer procedures. But will people be comfortable trading on a government-run platform? It’s a fiat exchange, and many will no doubt find it antithetical to Satoshi’s vision for crypto.Busan might also be opening itself to some major headaches via liabilities.What if the exchange is hacked? Or what if a listed token is the victim of a rug pull? When dealing with offshore exchanges this can add a level of complexity, but serving the city of Busan with a legal notice will be a lot easier for a Korean lawyer then tracking down an exchange that’s registered in Seychelles but has no central office.Of course, the whole thing could be a Potemkin Village designed to look like busy work and extract dollars from tax payers. When CoinDesk visited the Busan blockchain center in August, it was just a co-working space with a handful of people.

135,"Court filings against alleged crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried are shedding more light on the cozy relationship that burned down his empire: the one between crypto exchange FTX and its sister hedge fund Alameda Research.“There was no meaningful distinction between FTX customer funds and Alameda’s own,” the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged Tuesday. Alameda is said to have improperly siphoned $8 billion from customers of the now-bankrupt FTX.In its own suit, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Alameda enjoyed special access to FTX’s trading backend. It could execute trades faster than other customers and was exempt from auto-liquidation, both “unfair advantages,” the suit said. And it could borrow as much money as it liked.Alameda Research was the giant crypto hedge fund and market making firm that Sam Bankman-Fried launched in 2017, well before FTX. It started as a bitcoin arbitrage trader but quickly grew into one of the industry's most influential names, both for its perceived trading prowess and its billions of dollars in capital. Alameda's stature rose in tandem with FTX's; Bankman-Fried ran both until October 2021, when he declared he was leaving the fund.Publicly, the firms claimed to be two different companies that operated ""at an arm's length,"" Alameda's former CEO Caroline Ellison has previously said. But in reality Bankman-Fried ran FTX and Alameda in lockstep, the suits allege. And Alameda was playing with FTX customers' funds.Bankman-Fried, who owns 90% of Alameda, was arrested in the Bahamas Monday and faces criminal money laundering, conspiracy and fraud charges in the U.S. His stunning fall from CEO at the top of the crypto industry to international defendant took just over one month.In that time, the 30-year-old former billionaire had embarked on an aggressive apology tour to cast his role in FTX’s implosion as stupid and reckless but hardly criminal. At times he jumped around questions that probed Alameda’s relationship with FTX and has repeatedly denied knowing of any back doors.The new suits take direct aim at Bankman-Fried’s assertions. He “directed” FTX to let Alameda do things its other customers could not, such as fall below margin requirements on risky bets and execute trades when its accounts were empty, the suits allege. They went on to say these loopholes were baked into FTX’s code at Bankman-Fried’s direction.When institutional customers like Alameda placed trades on FTX they used an API, which is by design more streamlined – and thus faster – than the website retail traders use. But Alameda’s access was faster still. According to the CFTC, it “was able to bypass certain portions” of the FTX API to move “several milliseconds faster” than other big spenders.Part of Alameda’s speed boost was due to its other special privileges. Because it didn’t need to have enough money to place trades, it wholly sidestepped the automatic balance check that other accounts had to clear. This gave Alameda “another significant speed advantage.”Once, when Alameda maxed out its borrowing limit on FTX, Bankman-Fried told staffers to set a ceiling so high it would never be reached, the CFTC alleged. Alameda could theoretically withdraw tens of billions of dollars from FTX.Alameda’s infinite money glitch led to the hedge fund repaying “billions of dollars of loans” using customer deposits, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. It unsealed criminal charges against Sam Bankman-Fried Tuesday after the former FTX CEO’s arrest in the Bahamas.Bankman-Fried tried to hide the relationship between his “personal piggy bank” and FTX by routing money to seemingly unaffiliated bank accounts that Alameda controlled, according to the SEC. FTX used the unassuming account name “fiat@ftx.com” to track its sister company’s multi-billion-dollar debts without raising eyebrows. And Alameda never told third parties that its “loan” was from FTX.Even when FTX tried to untangle its liabilities in 2022 it gave special treatment to Alameda. Bankman-Fried stopped the exchange’s accounting systems from charging interest on the hedge fund’s $8 billion liability (it had done so automatically, per the SEC).Bankman-Fried “drafted and shared a document that questioned whether Alameda should be permanently shut down” in September 2022, months before it imploded, according to the CFTC.His reasoning: Alameda was taking on more risk than it was worth.“I think it might be time for Alameda Research to shut down. Honestly, it was probably time to do that a year ago,” Bankman-Fried wrote in a document titled “We came, we saw, we researched.”At the same time, Bankman-Fried acknowledged that Alameda played such a large role in FTX’s operations that it might be impossible to pull the plug. As FTX's primary market maker, ensured trades went smoothly for all FTX customers, not just itself. Disappearing Alameda would create a shortfall in liquidity that might undermine FTX's value as an exchange.“Given the amount that Alameda is doing, we can’t really shut it down,” he wrote, according to the CFTC.The SEC and CFTC chart Nov. 2 as the day Alameda and FTX began to unravel. On that day, the regulators said CoinDesk published an article that probed Alameda’s extensive FTT token holdings. FTT is a token issued by FTX, and Alameda had billions of dollars of FTT and other FTX-linked tokens on its balance sheet.“On November 6, 2022, in response to this article, the CEO of [rival exchange] Binance tweeted that, “[d]ue to recent revelations that have came (sic) to light,” he would be selling the remainder of his significant FTT holdings, which he acquired during the buyout from FTX seed investment,” the CFTC said, referring to CEO Changpeng Zhao.Binance’s call-to-liquidate tanked the price of FTT and triggered a run on deposits at FTX. One day later, it became clear to the exchange that it didn’t have enough cash to cover for customers, the CFTC said.At the same time, Alameda traders were directed to “sell everything that could be sold” in a mad dash to “generally do anything possible to quickly obtain billions of dollars in capital to send to FTX,” the CFTC said, noting Bankman-Fried played a key role in that effort.Bankman-Fried also planned to use Alameda’s fire sale to fill a hole at FTX US, which was also getting pummeled by withdrawals. Executives there had found “a shortfall they did not understand and were unable to quantify,” per the CFTC. (During his apology tour Bankman-Fried insisted that the U.S. exchange was never insolvent.)“On November 8, Bankman-Fried directed Alameda traders to prioritize meeting FTX US capital requirements and to send excess capital to FTX US. On information and belief, Alameda sent in excess of $185 million to FTX US to fill its shortfall,” the CFTC said.It was just one more criss-cross in the sprawling, unspoken ties between Alameda and all aspects of the FTX empire.",2022/12/13

Inverted yield curves have historically preceded economic recessions and imply declining confidence in short-term economic prospects.In combating inflation, the securities holdings on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet declined to $8.6 trillion for the week, ending Dec 7, down $76.7 billion from this time last year.Trading activity over the next several days will show whether today’s push higher results in short-term profit taking or represents a sustained increase in prices.BTC has ground to cover before it reaches psychologically important $20,000 support when viewing the asset’s moving averages. On a positive note, its current price is approaching its 50-day moving average of $17,895.The 50-day moving average is now within 15% of the 200-day moving average of $20,852. The $20,000 mark for BTC also represents the on-chain realized price for market participants. Recapturing this level would push BTC past a significant technical resistance and key price point.Ether’s price is a bit further on. Its daily price has risen to match its 50-day moving average, and it sits less than 10% away from its 200-day average.",2022/12/13
139,"There has never been a time in the world’s history where environmental sustainability for major businesses has been more critical. The planet is showing signs of dramatic change, and the public is calling for greater accountability from all industries. Often, the blockchain community is portrayed as part of the problem, but this is largely a misrepresentation. This technology may actually assist in the global transition necessary for a sustainable future.The possibilities afforded by sustainable blockchains are massive, and the upsides for the environment are too important to ignore. Of course, there are still challenges to address as is true of any industry, but they are recognized and are being actively worked on. What other industry has had its second-largest operator reduce its energy consumption and emissions by more than 99% in less than 10 years since inception?Stefan Renton is the sustainability lead at Polygon, a blockchain development platform. This opinion piece is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023 outlook.Today, the importance of ecologically sustainable business practices has become a central part of the popular narrative. Prominent companies rush to declare that they are launching various programs to address sustainability, and in many cases they do just what they say. However, it is also common for some of these businesses to hide behind opaque metrics and somewhat more interpretive goals. A lack of transparent oversight or explicit standards exacerbates this. Some companies have been caught fudging the truth about their efforts to be greener in an effort to merely improve their image (also known as “greenwashing”). This serves nobody but company executives and has sown mistrust amongst the broader public.Blockchains are often stigmatized for their burden on the environment. While it is true that Bitcoin itself and similar proof-of-work (PoW) chains have a considerable ecological impact, proof-of-stake (PoS) chains are vastly more energy efficient. For example, the Ethereum network recently upgraded to PoS, which saw Ethereum’s energy usage drop by 99.9%.Moreover, efforts are already underway to address and rectify Ethereum's historical carbon consumption via the newly formed Ethereum Climate Platform (ECP) – a collective of industry luminaries, including Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, ConsenSys, Microsoft, Aave and Polygon, which launched at COP27’s U.N. Climate Change Global Innovation Hub.With new green credentials, blockchain networks can be put to good use by improving tracking and verifiably proving emissions of a given organization or supply chain. Due to their inherent immutability, accountability and transparency, blockchain can track carbon balances and other environmental measures, holding to account companies that proclaim to be sustainable.For example, implementing smart contracts can automate the process of tracking how much carbon is produced at every step of a business's operations. This information could then be reported to various monitoring services and relayed to the public. The verifiable, cryptographically enforced nature of this data will guarantee that it cannot be falsified or obfuscated in any way.Incidentally, that same cryptography will also protect the privacy of the company’s reporting. Thanks to zero-knowledge (ZK) technology, unfalsifiable proofs can be generated that confirm the underlying information without revealing it. In basic terms, a company could provide evidence that it met various energy usage or carbon emission standards without disclosing the underlying data – a current blocker to company transparency when reporting details on emissions producing activities.Another way environmentally friendly blockchains can become a sustainability solution is through the tokenization and digital distribution of digital environmental assets. A recent example is the accelerated development of the carbon credit market, which has attracted the attention of leading organizations across the globe, from the largest registries that provide accreditation including Verra and Gold Standard, to international bodies such as the World Economic Forum.Projects including KlimaDAO and Toucan deliver tokenization of carbon credits, bringing about important discussion on the future of carbon markets and if and how they should be using blockchain technology.There are even blockchain-native iterations focused on solving the scaling problem and the limited supply of current carbon markets such as Nori, whose novel approach recognizes the need for measurable drawdown alongside carbon avoidance. Nori’s future-forward focus, which was not widely recognized in earlier years, has recently secured a partnership and integration with Bayer, which has the potential to deliver immense scale.Even the United Nations is inviting the applications of blockchain in climate action and supporting initiatives driven by the Web3 community.Blockchain's role in helping the environment can go far beyond energy footprints and carbon credits as well. We expect to see an increasing number of sustainability-focused systems launching in 2023, where things like water usage or plastic creation could similarly be tracked and reported. Governments and regulators could create clear standards for what levels of environmental impact are acceptable across various industries and utilize these blockchain systems to monitor them. This would not only benefit the planet itself, but it would also streamline business processes via clear expectations for emissions.Even electrical grids can be managed via blockchains and smart contracts. Where power is routed can be largely automated while also being tracked, and this development stands to make energy use far more equitable. Applications that improve energy demand management can become easier, providing incentives for grid users. Increased access to investment in renewable energy infrastructure is a real possibility enabled by blockchain.The aforementioned ECP is a prime example of the sentiment within Web3 to tackle this monumental challenge. Beyond efforts to mitigate Ethereum's previous carbon footprint, the ECP aims to create a positive impact via investment in scaling carbon-reducing technologies that leverage blockchain.Another important possibility of blockchain and its applications such as DeFi (decentralized finance) is its ability to provide tools to empower communities most affected by climate change and business generated consumption, such as those in the global south. In other applications such as supply chain, it can bring more transparency and provability to equitable distribution of revenue and improved treatment; the next generation of fair trade.Clearly, this technology is nascent, and nobody is saying that blockchain on its own is a panacea for dealing with climate change. Nonetheless, more industries must consider what this technology can offer. Perhaps the most important initial component is accountability for companies claiming to be engaging in sustainable practices. That said, there is so much more that is possible. The world should begin paying attention and get past the notion that blockchain is part of the problem because, in truth, it could form part of the solution.",2022/12/13
140,"Whether it’s Verizon courting government contracts for its 5G upgrade, blockchain startups deploying routers with crypto mining incentives, or Elon Musk making Starlink available to the Ukrainian resistance, broadband and internet of things (IoT) are the new battleground for companies, ideologies and visionaries.This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.While it is still too early to tell whether there will be a singular or divergent solution, the new technological framework for interoperability will have ideology embedded in its code. Crypto and freedom advocates should ensure decentralization as a principle is enshrined, and cooperate to realize and expand on Nikola Tesla’s vision of a decentralized, ubiquitous network.In the late 1800s, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse found themselves in an ideological battle over the future of electricity. Threatened by Tesla and Westinghouse’s widely adopted alternating currents (AC) power system, Edison built out his direct-current (DC) stations, while deploying ruthless public relations campaigns to undermine his rivals’ credibility. As the three men urgently took their products to market and built out supporting infrastructure, corporations on the periphery also competed for market share, including Brush Electricity Company – which installed its arc lighting solutions in key regions including New York City.Tim Kravchunovsky is the Founder and CEO of Chirp. A graduate of Columbia University’s Masters Program, he has over 20 years experience as a network engineer and previously consulted for the World Bank.The AC system won out and became the gold standard underlying all electrification. An important lesson remains for those developing new architecture: The best technology can triumph only when it is also widely adopted.After developing the AC system, Tesla devoted much of his life to revolutionizing wireless electricity. The inventor envisioned infinite energy via a global network of towers that would electrify the world without wires. While investors including J.P. Morgan initially backed Tesla’s venture based on his past success with AC electricity, they later cut funding – a system handing such power over to end users, independent of the large companies who clashed during the “War of the Currents,” was too radical for many to handle at the time, and the technology wasn’t in place yet.Tesla died penniless in New York City, but his vision of ubiquitous energy run across a decentralized wireless system has served as inspiration for scientists, entrepreneurs and world leaders. Founders need to think carefully about the incentive structures that go into building such a system, while resisting centralized parties looking to co-opt its mechanisms under their own infrastructures – the blockchain sector in particular is in a unique position to guard against these attempts.While there is heroism in Elon Musk – an heir to Tesla’s legacy – stepping in to provide Starlink to Ukrainian citizens, there are also warnings that founders should note. Following Starlink’s deployment, Musk walked back his initial support for the cause and threatened to withdraw the program unless the U.S. Defense Department footed the bill. Although Musk also walked back these comments and kept Starlink operational in the region, the reversal revealed an incentive structure based on geopolitics, profit margins, and a billionaire’s impulses – which millions of innocent people suddenly found themselves tethered to. Musk is hardly an outlier when it comes to the murky relationship between centralized vested interests and state power. Telecom companies provide troves of data on millions of users daily to government entities.As the original use case of blockchain technology, Bitcoin allows any individual – no matter their socioeconomic class or country of origin – to take custody of their money. When applied to IoT devices, broadband and telecommunications infrastructure, blockchain technology can bestow more universe digital rights, including the ability to access modern internet and phone services without being surveilled.In the current “builder’s market,” blockchain developers and founders need to pay closer attention to the developments unfolding across telecommunications, broadband and IoT, rather than speculative digital asset bubbles that, unfortunately, defined the space over the past few years. Whether it’s setting up routers to power decentralized wireless networks (following in the tradition of Satoshi Nakamoto sending himself test amounts of bitcoin), or writing interoperable code, the crypto community should apply the principles of decentralization to this next frontier, and work together to ensure the ubiquitous network as envisioned by Tesla can take hold on the same scale as the inventor’s AC gold standard.",2022/12/13
141,"When the decentralized marketplace Storeum debuted its own freshly minted cryptocurrency in July 2019, the STO token soon grabbed traders’ attention: The STO price jumped from a few cents to an all-time high around $35 for a few days in March 2020 before quickly settling back to less than $1.But Storeum has since gone mostly quiet. Its website no longer works and social media accounts are inactive. The token technically still exists, in zombie form, as a contract on the Ethereum blockchain. This year, the STO has taken another step toward oblivion: It has vanished from the pricing site CoinGecko, which lists nearly 13,000 cryptocurrencies that are still considered viable in some form.CoinGecko officials would not confirm when exactly Storeum was deactivated from its website. But a cursory search using the Wayback Machine, which archives websites from prior dates, shows that a Storeum token page was still active as of early 2022. Now, typing Storeum into CoinGecko’s search bar turns up no results.Call it a dead coin.During the crypto bull market of recent years, the number of cryptocurrencies seemed to be ever-increasing, roughly quadrupling from 2019 through early 2022, based on data from the website Statista. Since peaking at 10,397 in February 2022, the number has dropped by about 1,000, the biggest-ever decline in the 13-year-old crypto industry’s volatile history.“It’s relatively simple for someone to create a token,” said Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko. “But these tokens can obviously lose interest extremely quickly.”Just as STO arrived during an earlier crypto bull-market hype cycle, a bevy of tokens appeared last year as bitcoin (BTC) – the oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market value, often viewed as an industry bellwether – shot to a record $69,000.According to CoinGecko, which uses a different methodology from Statista’s, over 8,000 cryptocurrencies were newly listed in 2021, but some 3,300 of them, or roughly 41%, ended up being deactivated and delisted.“During this period, many cryptocurrency projects, tokens and coins with little to no value or any immediate or discernible purpose were launched by various anonymous developers,” Julia Ng, growth marketing at CoinGecko, wrote in a recent analysis. “Few were actually committed to their projects, which resulted in a high rate of failure, and thus their ultimate demise.”Tokens might be removed from the site due to a lack of any discernible trading activity within the last two months, based on CoinGecko's methodology. A coin might also be taken off CoinGecko if it's deemed to be a ""rug pull"" or other scams, or if the project team requests a deactivation.""This might occur when the team disbands, rebrands, shutters the project, or undergo major token overhauls where old tokens become sufficiently illiquid or dead, according to CoinGecko standards,"" Ng wrote.The overall crypto market’s capitalization has shrunk from an all-time high of $3 trillion in November 2021 to about $850 billion now. Bitcoin’s price has fallen 66% over the past year and ether (ETH) is down 71%.Kaiko’s Carey estimated that the number of failed tokens could be “significantly higher in the past two years” because of the explosion in 2017 in the number of ERC-20 tokens – a type that’s easy to mint and runs atop the Ethereum blockchain.“It’s relatively simple for someone to create a token and an associated decentralized exchanges [DEX] liquidity pool,” Carey told CoinDesk. “If no one is providing liquidity, there will be little or no trading volume.”.Rug pullBesides losing buyers’ interests, some token failures could be associated with scams, according to Chainalysis Director of Research Kim Grauer.One of the more common schemes, referred to in the gallows-humor jargon of crypto traders as the “rug pull,” involves “creating a token, funding the liquidity pool, and then removing all the liquidity after an initial rush of people buy the token,” as Carey describes it.As is the case with Storeum, the contract behind the token remains on the blockchain; the data is still there, for posterity, even when the token has gone dormant and is long forgotten. Etherscan, a data explorer for the Ethereum blockchain, shows no transactions have occurred for 231 days.A warning notice on the Etherscan page reads, ""Warning! There are reports that this token used a fake team profile on their website. Please exercise caution when interacting with this token.""At one point, back in 2019, there was chatter on the forum bitcointalk.org that the Storeum project might be a ""scam hitting on all cylinders,"" including speculation that team members were ginned up using artificial intelligence.Chainalysis’s Grauer told CoinDesk that “it is difficult for a token to totally ‘die’ because the code keeps the project running even without buyers.”The existence of dead coins points up a key paradox of the crypto industry, according to Kaiko's Carey: Decentralization, often portrayed as a pillar of virtue, can proves to be little more than an illusion. Just like the fast growth.It's “decentralization, in that the bar to creating tokens has been dramatically lowered in recent years,” Carey said. It's “centralization, in that many of these tokens or projects relied on one or a few individuals to provide liquidity and keep the project alive. Centralized exchanges are well within their right to remove tokens with little or no trading volume, as they won’t contribute to revenue and likely entail some cost to upkeep.”Some tokens might be better off dead.",2022/12/13
142,"Déjà vu. You know that feeling, when you momentarily are not sure of where you are in the timeline and you wonder what you’ve missed. We’re there now.The “blockchain not bitcoin” chorus seems to be re-emerging, taking us back to the 2016-18 heyday of thematic and platform consortia convinced that the benefits of greater efficiency would overcome corporate competition. Bitcoin was an asset with no backing or clear utility, the implied argument seemed to go, whereas blockchain, well that was a technology.Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.Last week, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal titled “Blockchain Is Much More Than Crypto,” in which he reminded us of the potentially far-reaching impact of tokenization and peer-to-peer payments and drilled down on the benefits of risk reduction and settlement speed. Last month, Citi published the results of a survey showing that 92% of participating institutions see value in tokenization while 88% are either exploring distributed ledger use cases or actively participating in blockchain projects. Over the past few days, the Red Cross talked about ongoing work on a blockchain-based aid distribution prototype, and Japanese banking conglomerate Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group announced plans to work on soulbound tokens for digital identity.What’s going on? Is this part of a post-FTX “reset,” a cathartic back-to-basics? Or is something else in play?Both. Yes, we are likely to see more public discussion about distributed ledger efficiencies and less about crypto asset trading and investment. This is a natural reflex after the damage done by layered leverage, flimsy tokenomics and trading fraud, and some high-profile reminders that crypto is not just about greed are more than welcome.Read more: BTC Dominance Is Behaving Weirdly, and That’s Sort of Good | OpinionIt is also an acknowledgement that there is a constant battle for attention, and the “X not Y” model assumes that only one variable is worthy. “Blockchain not bitcoin” emerged in 2018 as an attempt by enterprise projects to capitalize on the market’s performance woes – the new version does the same but swaps in “crypto” to reflect the ecosystem’s spread.So, a large part of this is a cyclical narrative shift. But there’s something else going on as well. This shift comes on top of a longer-term tale of technological evolution and shiny things.The last wave of blockchain hype may not seem to have produced much value. Pilots and proofs of concept involving lettuce, plastics, even (alarmingly) nuclear weapons seemed to deliver no practical utility. Groups working on blockchain use cases for trade finance, healthcare, telecoms, insurance and more have either gone quiet or been wound down.And we have seen some recent high-profile distributed ledger failures. A couple of weeks ago, IBM and Maersk announced the closure of their blockchain-based supply chain joint venture TradeLens. Last month, the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) canceled its much-hyped blockchain project after years of delays and cost overruns. This summer blockchain-based trade finance initiative we.trade, backed by IBM and 12 major European banks, went into liquidation and B3i – a blockchain insurance venture backed by more than 20 insurers and reinsurers – ceased operation.So, the “please, not again” discomfort at the renewed protagonism of “blockchain” potential is understandable and even healthy (inflated expectations of any sort should be kept in check) – but not necessarily correct.Both hype and failure are a natural part of a new technology’s evolution. Remember the dot-com bubble? That wasn’t just about crazy stock valuations – it was as much about the promise of rapid societal change, with business models rewiring their engagement models and individuals flourishing in their new-found creative independence. In the early days of any radical innovation, manifesto and prophecy often get confused, and experimentation – of which failure is an integral part – is the only way to test the bounds of reality.See also: Central Banks and Bitcoin: Closer Than You Think | OpinionYou’re probably wondering where the successes are, and that’s fair because they don’t get much attention. They’re hidden in the persistence of some projects that could have given up ages ago, in new use cases under trial, and in a changing participant profile. Distributed ledger work has been ongoing all along, but given the rapid growth of crypto markets, the “flashiness” of some participants and the gripping drama of the year so far, it has been largely overlooked. Things that move fast get more attention. Enterprise experimentation does not move fast.Some examples: A few years ago, we got excited when a commercial bank successfully issued blockchain-based assets in pilot tests. This week a state-owned bank did the same but for real, and at least one government is almost there, while other governments and banks are testing the process with some intriguing innovations. We also have trials where the main participants are central banks. That is definitely progress.Large traditional asset managers such as KKR, Apollo and Hamilton Lane are issuing blockchain-based tokens representing funds. Not as a proof-of-concept but for real. Just this week we learned that Vanguard Australia is using a distributed ledger for back-office settlement, Starbucks (one of the largest unregulated “banks” in the world) has launched a non-fungible token (NFT) experience in beta for its Rewards users, and Goldman Sachs as well as Germany’s music rights management society have carried out separate distributed ledger tests. Recent initiatives seem to have learned from the failures to date: start small, iterate up the ladder and never overlook human incentives.​There’s also an ideological battle afoot. Many in the crypto industry hate the idea of anything being “permissioned” and accuse all gated experimentation of being “useless” while overlooking regulatory restrictions and client preferences. The assumption seems to be that everyone prefers open networks, permissioned blockchains can never be based on public ones and that the potential to integrate with stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) is irrelevant.Read more: After FTX: Rebuilding Trust in Crypto’s Founding Mission | OpinionThere’s also a strong cohort who thinks we should focus on more innovative applications since traditional markets work fine, in spite of settlement risk, gated access and a dangerous lack of transparency. More efficient and lower cost debt markets, for example, open up opportunities for a much broader demographic than big banks, possibly facilitating the development of sophisticated markets in regions currently underserved. They also make new types of products possible, such as intraday repo, enhancing liquidity in tight markets. Could this be done on traditional databases? Some of it, sure, but would that be future-proofing market evolution? Determining the answer to that is precisely what the experimentation is for.As the dust settles on the FTX fallout, and as the crypto ecosystem takes stock of the damage and starts to heal, we can expect more prominence for enterprise blockchain milestones. This doesn’t at all mean that crypto is losing its sparkle or that asset innovation is done. Last week we saw the emergence of an intriguing new derivative that lets traders bet on the Ethereum staking yield, potentially coalescing market acceptance of a benchmark interest rate. We are also still seeing glimmers of institutional interest in crypto assets as investment. None of that will disappear.But a time in the sun for the less-glamorous side of blockchain evolution will be good for the industry as a whole. We could well still see some ideas that strike us as fanciful, because people are people and creativity should never cease to surprise – who knows, some might even stick. But we can certainly expect more solid experimentation at senior levels.Perhaps even more important: we have to push back on the “X not Y” mentality. The crypto ecosystem is certainly big enough by now for any number of approaches, and this industry grew on the back of permissionless innovation – it’s incongruous to see crypto enthusiasts argue that only one approach is worth any time or attention. For those who care about distributed ledger utility, there’s plenty to get excited about. For those who think there’s greater societal value in trading and saving, markets will continue to evolve and some prices will eventually recover. Many of us may be frustrated by the amount of pixels given to what we personally see as useless ideas – but we should think about what our industry would look like were one reduced group to have the power to decide what is “valid” and what isn’t.Meanwhile, the narrative shift will act as a refreshing reminder that this industry is about much more than profits and portfolio allocations, and that the potential goes way beyond sentiment recovery, regulatory clarity and deeper understanding. “Blockchain and crypto” – there’s plenty of room for both.",2022/12/13
143,"Mending crypto’s reputation on Capitol Hill, tarnished in the wake of crypto exchange FTX’s collapse, will require continuing to engage with U.S. policymakers, according to Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association.Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas Monday, just hours before he was scheduled to testify virtually before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee in Washington, D.C.Smith said on CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin” program on Monday that the industry can “get beyond this current crisis.” What is needed is to work with a “bipartisan set of policymakers who are interested in finding the right regulatory framework” for crypto, not only to protect consumers but to drive innovation.Read more: FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Arrested in the Bahamas“We're going to see a number of bipartisan legislative proposals that are put forth that are going to be very much vetted and debated by multiple committees in Congress, and that we really could see some momentum around getting some legislation done,” Smith said.“What we don’t want them doing is rushing through legislation that hasn’t been vetted or that nobody understands,” Smith said. She said now is the time for lawmakers to ask questions to get to the bottom of what happened at FTX, especially what happened to the customer funds that were lost in the shuffle.Politicians could also think twice about taking donations from primarily crypto-based platforms, according to Smith.Read more: FTX US 'Was Not Independent' of Parent Company, New FTX CEO Will Say in House TestimonyWhether former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s political donations, which amounted to upwards of $73 million, can be clawed back to repay FTX creditors, is unlikely, according to Smith.“Once that money is donated, it’s usually fairly quickly spent,” Smith said, pointing out that in the weeks preceding the election, candidates spend a fairly large quantity of the money they’ve received on sending out mailers and buying airtime.“If it turns out the source of these funds were indeed customer deposits, that’s obviously a massive misuse,” said Smith. “It could be that the genie's out of the bottle and they won’t be able to get it back in.”",2022/12/13
144,"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares hit a record-high discount rate relative to the price of bitcoin (BTC), pushing past 50% for the first time after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reiterated its reasons for denying an application to convert the world’s largest bitcoin fund into an exchange-traded fund.Crypto analysts have said that the discount would likely close if the conversion went through, since the redemption process available for ETF market makers would likely cause the shares to trade back toward the price of the underlying bitcoin.In the past couple hours, the discount has since pulled back slightly to around 48.66%.GBTC, which is managed by Grayscale Investments, was designed as a way to let investors in traditional markets gain exposure to bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency. The fund currently has about $10.7 billion of assets under management, a figure that’s down 65% over the past 12 months thanks largely to this year’s steep decline in crypto prices.The fund is trading at a discount partly because investors, while free to sell GBTC shares in the market, have no way to redeem their holdings in exchange for the bitcoin in the trust. And in the meantime they’re being charged a 2% fee.Negative sentiment surrounding the trust has swelled over the last few weeks as fears surfaced that crypto trading firm Genesis Global Trading, which is owned by Grayscale’s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), might file for bankruptcy.Grayscale says it’s operating as business as usual, but analysts and Twitter posters have suggested that any financial ramifications for DCG might somehow, at some point, affect GBTC. (CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary of DCG.)Pablo Jodar, a crypto analyst at GenTwo, a financial service provider, said that some “investors do not trust the information that Grayscale discloses about the quantity of bitcoin that they’re holding, which contributes to selling pressure.”He also said that a recent spate of deposit withdrawals from the big crypto exchange Binance may have dampened market sentiment. “The market is not trusting intermediaries anymore, and that is why you see investors moving money out of exchanges and financial instruments like GBTC,” he added.Grayscale is currently being sued by hedge fund Fir Tree to obtain details about GBTC in order to investigate potential mismanagement and conflicts of interest. The firm said it wants Grayscale to resume redemptions and cut its 2% fees for the trust.",2022/12/13
145,"FTX was a massive hydra with subsidiaries across the globe. Amid FTX’s failure and entrance into bankruptcy court, one of these subsidiaries appears to be relatively unscathed: FTX Japan. Assuming FTX Japan makes it through, here are some things that other nations can learn from Japan’s experience.J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog. This opinion piece is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023 outlook.FTX Japan is a Japanese-based crypto exchange, formerly known as Liquid, that Bahamas-based FTX purchased in early 2022. Whereas the customers of most FTX entities are in limbo, FTX Japan says that it is close to paying out its customers in full:""We have put together a plan for the resumption of withdrawal service, which has been shared with and approved by the new FTX Trading management team. Development work for this plan has already started and our engineering teams are working to allow FTX Japan users to withdraw their funds.""Japanese customers' cash and crypto will not be bogged down in U.S. bankruptcy proceedings given ""how these assets are held and property interests under Japanese law,"" the exchange says. Meanwhile, the funds of customers of the flagship Bahamas-based exchange, FTX International; Chicago-based FTX US; and FTX Australia remain stuck in bankruptcy limbo.What is it about Japan that may end up allowing Japanese customers of FTX to get their money before anyone else?In brief, careful regulation of crypto exchanges.Spurred by the failure of Mt. Gox in 2014 and the 2017 hacking of Coincheck, both Tokyo-based exchanges, Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) established a broad set of standards for crypto exchanges, or what it defines as Crypto Asset Exchange Service Providers (CAESP). The FSA is also responsible for overseeing banking, securities and exchanges, and insurance sectors.Read more: JP Koning – Let's Stop Regulating Crypto Exchanges Like Western Union Here are six key elements of the FSA's framework for overseeing crypto exchanges:1. Japanese crypto exchanges must segregate customer fiat and crypto from the exchange's own crypto. That is, they can't deposit the exchange's own operating funds into the same account, or wallet, as their customers' funds.A separation of funds reduces the scope for fraud. For example, it would have been easier for FTX executives based in the Bahamas to raid customer funds held at their Japanese subsidiary if those funds were mingled together with FTX's corporate money.2. Going beyond segregation, Japanese exchanges must entrust customers' fiat money balances to a third-party Japanese institution – a trust company or bank trust – where they are managed by a trustee with customers designated as the beneficiaries.By interposing a third-party trustee between FTX Japan and its customers, regulators would have reduced the latitude for FTX insiders to tamper with Japanese customers' cash.Another advantage of a trust requirement is that it adds a layer of protection in the event of bankruptcy. Storing customers' funds with a third-party trustee prevents them from being diverted into a general pot where they can be claimed by an exchange's other competing creditors.Other countries are less stringent. Take the U.S., for instance. U.S. exchanges, including FTX US, operate under state money transmitter law. While some states do require money transmitters to keep customer funds in a trust but many don't, including Florida, Pennsylvania and Georgia. This lack of a trust company layer may be one reason why FTX US customers haven’t heard a peep about getting their money back.FTX Japan claims to be holding 6.03 billion yen worth of customer fiat in trust, or US$44 million.3. A more explicit bankruptcy protection stipulates that customers of Japanese exchanges are entitled to receive payment in priority to general creditors in the case of bankruptcy.Customers are creditors of an exchange. They own an exchange-issued IOU. But a crypto exchange may have other creditors including bond holders, bank lenders, suppliers or other subsidiaries holding inter-company debts. When an exchange goes under, all of these IOU owners are desperate to get some of the remaining crumbs. Putting customers at the very front of the line of creditors is a way to protect them.Compare the luxury of being a Japanese customer of FTX to the plight of Australian customers of FTX. To their horror, they recently found themselves competing with the parent company, FTX Trading, for part of the Australian bankruptcy estate.4. The FSA requires Japanese exchanges to keep at least 95% of customers' crypto in cold wallets. Because cold wallets are not connected to the internet, they are more secure against hacking and internal fraudsters.FTX Japan claims it currently holds 3,194 bitcoin (BTC) in cold wallets, as well as 16,418 in ether (ETH), 64.1 million XRP and a handful of other assets.Many exchanges in unregulated jurisdictions already use cold wallets (although probably not for 95% of their customers' funds). However, smaller exchanges may use other exchanges such as FTX to store customer funds rather than their own cold wallets.Australian exchange Digital Surge, with around 30,000 customers, recently entered into voluntary administration because it kept a significant amount of money on FTX. Huobi lost $13.2 million worth of customer funds that it had stored on FTX, while Crypto.com had $10 million in exposure.Japan’s 95% cold wallet rule helps protect against such losses, as does the following 5% rule:5. For the 5% of customer's crypto that can be kept in a less-secure hot [internet connected] wallet, Japanese exchanges must ""back"" each unit of hot-walleted crypto with exchange-owned crypto held in a segregated cold wallet. So, for example, if an exchange holds 5 BTC of customer funds in a hot wallet, it must hold another 5 BTC of its own personal coins in reserve, for a total of 10 BTC.The FSA refers to these reserves as an exchange's performance-guarantee assets. If there are any inappropriate leakages from hot wallets, the exchange's reserve must be used to make customers whole.6. Lastly, all of these rigid requirements must be verified by an external watchdog.Each Japanese exchange must undergo a yearly ""audit of separate management"" whereby a public accountant examines that each of the above requirements for holding assets are abided by. That is, the auditor verifies that all customer fiat money is being held in trust, that customer funds are segregated from exchange funds, that at least 95% of all crypto is held in a cold wallet and that the exchange is holding an appropriate amount of performance guarantee assets.FTX Japan customers haven't received their funds back yet. So we don't know for sure if they’ll be made whole. But initial indications suggest they will be. If so, credit goes to the six preceding protections afforded to customers of Japanese exchanges.In response to FTX's failure, many jurisdictions are already scrambling to fashion their own regulations for crypto exchanges. They should be watching Japan closely.",2022/12/13
146,"For a few years, I’ve been thinking about why social movements like crypto and bitcoin have so much momentum. I often get emails from proponents of crypto as an anti-monopoly tool, and a lot of smart people I respect believe that it is based on a groundbreaking technology that will sweep the world. I don’t see it that way. I think it’s a social movement based on a dangerous get-rich-quick scam. But there’s a tremendous amount of goodwill involved, and as with GameStop, the underlying driver of the energy in this movement is mass and legitimate disillusionment with liberal institutions who have failed to deliver.Matt Stoller is the author of the BIG newsletter, where a version of this article first appeared in 2021, and former policymaker who focuses on the politics of market power and antitrust. This article is part of ""Crypto 2023.""This weekend, I held a forum for paid subscribers on whether crypto is a useful anti-monopoly tool, and the debate got heated. I learned a lot, and after reading the comments I decided to write an essay, because it seems like there’s a lot of confusion about what crypto is and what it’s for. Dec. 8, for instance, there’s a hearing in the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on the crypto, with lots of talk about innovation along with warnings about risks and regulation. While useful, such traditional financial reform chatter obscures the far more interesting political debate that crypto has brought to the surface of our society about finance, monopoly and the state itself.To explain what is going on, I think it helps to start with a historical analogy, the state that always seems to be a critical ingredient of every financial crisis: Florida. In particular, Florida in the 1920s.In the early 1920s, just after a horrific war and decades of reform that ended in cynicism, a wave of speculation occurred around land in Florida. Thousands of disillusioned Americans in the Northeast sought to get rich quick, like the ""mushroom millionaires"" who had profited in the Great War that killed so many. These speculators used financial instruments and easy money, the equivalent of deregulation, to gamble massively across the economy. The mania became so insane that there was speculation over land lots in the city of Nettie, Florida, a city which later turned out not to exist. Eventually, the bubble popped. First, multiple hurricanes hit the state. The stock market did the rest by crashing in 1929. The result was tears, losses and decades of litigation.See also: The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Culture | OpinionAnd with that, let’s talk crypto. Cryptocurrencies are a social movement based on the belief that markings in a ledger on the internet have intrinsic value. The organizers of these ledgers call these markings bitcoin or dogecoin or offer other names based on the specific ledger. That’s really all a cryptocurrency is. There’s no magic. It’s not money, though it has money-like properties. It’s not anything except a set of markings. Sure, the technology behind the ledgers and how to create more of these markings is kind of neat.But crypto is a movement based on energetic storytellers who spin fables about the utopian future to come. In a lot of ways, cryptocurrencies are like Florida land that no one ever intends to use. It has value in the moment it is traded, but only because there’s a collective belief that it has some intrinsic worth. (There is a wide variety of ""tools"" in the crypto world, like [non-fungible tokens], smart contracts, and global computing systems, but they don’t work, and none of them have any use cases except speculation and money laundering, and even in their idealized form they have no use cases aside from doing stuff you can already do far more easily through existing technology, with a different permissioning model.)That said, the crypto narrative is one that anti-monopolists in general find deeply compelling, since both the anti-monopoly movement and the cryptocurrency movement emerged out of the financial crisis. Elizabeth Warren became a U.S. senator out of the crisis, and eventually pivoted to making the first call to break up big tech. Bitcoin was created on Jan. 3, 2009, a few weeks before Barack Obama was inaugurated as president. Inscribed in the code of Bitcoin is the following phrase, “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” Both crypto and the anti-monopoly movement are reactions to the destruction wrought by neoliberalism.Both financial crisis reformers and Bitcoin proponents believe that the existing financial order is a collusive arrangement between large banks who are supported by government power. Money laundering, tax evasion, criminal activity and fraud are fine as long as you are an insider in this system, and the Federal Reserve and various other government institutions will not only not stop corrupt insiders, but will subsidize and bail them out if necessary. Meanwhile, the rest of us have to live with foreclosures, high interest rates on credit cards and high fees for middlemen in every aspect of the economy.Indeed, it’s hard to see how our social contract is legitimate or fair. No one went to jail for the financial crisis, and the ongoing parade of scandals is nonstop. Just to take a random story that came out last week, several groups published a finding that the $11 trillion private investment industry is a haven for money laundering. We all know there will be no state reaction to fix this.So what is to be done? The traditional populist view is that we should reform our social order through politics, things like mass education, elections, and civic engagement. That’s how Elizabeth Warren sees the world. She wants to strengthen the state so it can restore the social order, one that will tolerate less cheating and will involve the rule of law applied to the powerful.The crypto response is different. The crypto response is to reject the social contract itself as irredeemably corrupt. Their goal is put pressure on the state itself by creating a money-like instrument outside of the public rule-setting capacity of the government. This is framed in the name of consumer choice, as in the state shouldn’t be able to boss you around and tell you what you can do with your money. After all, it’s yours. And anyone who doesn’t buy into this idea is inherently defending a set of collusive bailout-friendly institutions that we sometimes call liberal democracy.But core to having a state, even a democratic one, is the ability to ban things and use coercion to enforce such a ban. Societies and social contracts are built on cooperative mechanisms, but also barriers and enforceable rules. In this framework, the argument of crypto proponents makes no sense. It is basically, ""You can’t tell me not to have access to a money-like mechanism, even if the point of this instrument is to defraud people or engage in ransomware attacks, and even if we know that the ultimate endpoint is a giant collapse when people trapped in a liquidity crisis find out that there is no lender of last resort for Bitcoin or any of the other cryptocurrencies. If you do, that’s tyranny.""In other words, skeptics of cryptocurrencies generally believe that cryptocurrencies are easily manipulated mechanisms to launder money, commit fraud, evade sanctions, empower dictators, engage in heavily leveraged speculation prone to collapse, and ultimately break the state itself. The response to this concern is easy – exactly how is this accusation any different than the existing order? Surely if insiders are allowed to cheat in our regulated banking system, then why should we treat it as legitimate? Why not build our own financial channels? Yeah, maybe it’s bad, but at least we’re not Goldman Sachs or AIG.That’s why I don’t think this movement can be dismissed as merely get-rich-quick mania. There’s goodwill and energy behind this movement, as well as a lot of wealthy cynics and scam artists. But the lack of legitimacy of liberal democracies is real. Increasingly, though, the arguments from cryptocurrency proponents are changing. They are saying they want to be regulated, they are not opposed to the state, they are just into technological innovation, and so forth. That’s why every witness in today’s hearing said they want regulation by the state. I don’t buy it.We’re in new stage, where some very scary people are taking over monetary politics. If crypto boosters sought aggressive reform of the existing financial order, democratizing the Fed, clamping down on big banks, and so forth, and said that until that happens, they will pursue alternative currencies, that would be one thing. But that’s not at all how the politics of crypto works. In Washington, D.C., those who opposed the bailouts and sought to break up the banks – the reformers – are the most skeptical of cryptocurrencies.See also: 'Probably Nothing': Why People Still Hate Crypto | OpinionMeanwhile, the pro-crypto lobby includes men like Pat Toomey, the most pro-bailout and pro-Fed politician in D.C., and is financed by libertarian billionaire Marc Andreessen, a key force behind the rise of Facebook. Led by the leaders of Miami and New York City, a wave of mayors are actively trying to fuse cryptocurrencies to local governments, with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez asserting that these are ""natural resources"" and telling voters they may never have to pay taxes.The amount of utopian [crap] and fake promises on a technology that doesn’t really work as anything but a speculative bubble and money laundering device should be a big red flag. Crypto is a movement based on the theory that the existing nation-state is a system rigged by billionaires, and the right response is to create a different and more corrupt order rigged by different billionaires, money launderers and dictators. It will, of course, all end in tears, ironically when the Fed ends its monetary stimulus, creating bubbles across the economy. That much we know. But how much ruin this movement engenders will depend on whether and how quickly we can restore the legitimacy of our existing governing systems.UPDATE (DEC. 14 – 17:30 UTC): Adds original publication date.",2022/12/13
147,"U.S derivatives regulator Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is suing the founder of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, and trading arm Alameda Research, according to a press release.The suit comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Bankman-Fried for defrauding FTX investors.In its filing, the CFTC said Bankman-Fried had made misleading statements about the health of his companies and the user of customer funds, conduct which had had a “significant price impact” on commodities such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).The document repeats SEC allegations that Bankman-Fried had inappropriately mixed customer assets and blurred the line between Alameda and FTX, with money spent on private jets and “furtively” used to to pay for a Super Bowl ad and sports stadium sponsorship.“The use of customer funds by Alameda was not authorized by FTX customers, and FTX customers were not made aware that their funds were being used by Alameda,” the filing said, adding that this contradicts both best practices for derivatives exchanges and contractual terms of service.In mid-2022, after a crash in crypto markets that saw the likes of Terra and Celsius Network collapse, Bankman-Fried’s companies “portrayed that they remained highly profitable and liquid” in public, despite Alameda’s liability to FTX outstripping the latter’s total lifetime revenue, the document said.But rosy public statements about profits contradicted what Bankman-Fried really knew, the CFTC alleged. In September, Bankman-Fried drafted a never-published document saying Alameda should be shut down permanently because it didn’t make enough money from trading, the filing said.The CFTC was not immediately available for comment.Bloomberg initially reported on news of the lawsuit.Read more: US SEC Charges Sam Bankman-Fried for Defrauding FTX InvestorsUPDATE (Dec 13, 15:10 UTC): Adds details from filing.UPDATE (Dec 13, 16:17 UTC): Removes ""report"" from headline and confirms filing.",2022/12/13
148,"The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.1% in November from the month prior, slowing more than expected from October’s 0.4% pace, in a sign of progress in the Federal Reserve's campaign to bring down soaring inflation.The report pushed up prices for cryptocurrencies, based on the expectation that less-worrisome consumer-price increases might give the Fed more cover to ease up on interest-rate hikes.On an annual basis, the CPI rose 7.1%, the U.S. Labor Department reported Tuesday, below the 7.3% projected by economists in a FactSet survey.Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, which has been relatively steady so far in December, jumped 1.6% in the minutes after the report was released, to about $17,930; it's up 5.2% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second overall, is up 6.9% over 24 hours to $1,335. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) rose 3.8%.Traders have been monitoring the data for signs of whether the Fed’s rate hikes this year are helping to bring down the pace of consumer-price increases, which earlier this year hit a four-decade high. In general, tighter monetary policy puts downward pressure on prices of risky assets, from stocks to cryptocurrencies.The U.S. central bank's monetary-policy setting group, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is meeting this week behind closed doors, with a decision scheduled for Wednesday along with fresh projections by officials on the future path of economic indicators.Core CPI – which excludes food and energy because they tend to be more volatile – rose 0.2% in November, also a slowdown from October, the Labor Department reported.The weaker-than-expected inflation figure comes a day after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that respondents see one-year inflation running at a 5.2% pace.The November CPI release is the final major economic report of 2022 and the last key input the FOMC will see before as this week's meeting kicks off Tuesday. The two-day session is set to conclude on Wednesday with a statement due out at 2 p.m. ET and a fresh ""Summary of Economic Projections"" from top Fed officials, known colloquially as the ""dot plot.""“Tuesday's CPI release along with Wednesday's FOMC meeting will undoubtedly set the tone for financial markets as we head into next year,” analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note, expecting another 50 basis point (0.5 percentage point) rate hike by the Fed on Wednesday.Fed Chair Jerome Powell has previously said that he and his colleagues project the interest rate to peak – probably sometime next year – at a level that's higher than officials' previous telegraphed 4.9%. According to Deutsche Bank, the rate could reach 5.1% before the Fed pauses its campaign.“We expect the dot plot to lean hawkish … reinforcing the committee’s view that policy will need to remain restrictive for longer to guide inflation back to target,” the note said.Analysts at the French bank BNP Paribas see the terminal rate reaching 5.25% by March and holding that level until the end of the year.“Communications will emphasize the likelihood of holding rates at restrictive levels over a longer time horizon – possibly even challenging current market pricing,” they wrote in a note.Powell will speak following the FOMC’s rate hike decision, at 2:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday.UPDATE (Dec. 13, 13:43): Added information about the FOMC meeting Dec. 13-14 and comments from Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas analysts.",2022/12/13

153,"Bitcoin (BTC) rose on Tuesday as investors braced for crucial U.S. data likely to show that the consumer price index (CPI) growth is slowing in response to Federal Reserve's (Fed) aggressive liquidity tightening.The leading cryptocurrency neared $17,500 for the first time since Nov. 1, shrugging off concerns about the health of dominant digital assets exchange Binance.Other cryptocurrencies including ETH, XRP, DOT, MATIC and LTC rose, albeit by less than bitcoin's 24-hour gain of 2.4%, CoinDesk data showed.Bitcoin probably benefited from haven flows stemming from the unease about the health of the dominant cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The cryptocurrency's dominance rate, or the share in the crypto market, rose to 41.4%, the highest since Oct. 29. Historically, traders have piled into bitcoin, lifting its dominance rate during times of stress in the broader market.""Bitcoin's dominance has finally broken above 41%. Its a textbook de-risking market signal,"" Lewis Harland, portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital, said in a daily market note.In addition, the pre-U.S. CPI gain of 0.5% in the futures tied to the S&P 500, the benchmark for risk assets worldwide, likely helped bitcoin.The CPI inflation is forecast to have slowed to an annual pace of 7.3% in November, reaching the lowest since December 2021 and down from October's 7.7% increase, according to a consensus estimate by Refinitiv.Meanwhile, the growth in core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, is expected to have slowed to 6.1% from October's 6.3%.A soft inflation print will likely bolster hopes for a so-called Fed pivot in favor of easing, bringing cheer to risk assets. The Federal Reserve has raised rates by 375 basis points since March to control rampant inflation and the liquidity tightening has ruined risk assets, including bitcoin.Bitcoin traders, however, are playing it safe, and perhaps rightfully so, as a hotter-than-expected CPI could dash the already elevated Fed pivot hopes, triggering broad-based risk aversion and flight to safety.""BTC futures open interest remains flat at $8.25 billion while funding rates skew negative. Traders are taking a predominantly bearish stance,"" Harland said.Open interest refers to the dollar value locked in the number of active futures contracts. The funding rate, charged every eight hours by exchanges, refers to the cost of holding bullish/bearish positions in the perpetual futures market. A negative rate implies bears are paying the bulls to keep their positions open and leverage is skewed on the bearish side.Griffin Ardern, a trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said traders are trying to go long on volatility.Traders typically go long on volatility by purchasing both bullish call and bearish put options. The strategy makes money if the underlying asset either surges or tanks enough to recover more than what was paid to purchase calls and puts.Bitcoin may see heightened price volatility, as too may market-moving events are lined up in the next 72 hours.""The central banks of the four countries – the U.S., Japan, European Union and the U.K. – will announce interest rate decisions this week.

154,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) value proposition is based on the cryptocurrency’s potential usefulness. Its level of future adoption, therefore, is more sensitive to changes in interest rates – or has a longer duration – than gold, Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a research report Monday looking at the benefits of both assets in a diversified portfolio.In the last year came the “end of a decade of easy money” as central banks raised interest rates saw a sharp reduction in speculative positions in gold and bitcoin, the report said. However, gold is roughly unchanged year on year, whereas bitcoin is down 75%, in line with high-growth tech companies.Tight financial conditions are expected to be a drag on bitcoin’s user adoption, the report said, and this makes a repeat of the cryptocurrency’s strong returns of the last decade less likely. Volatility will likely remain elevated until it develops more use cases.“The development of real use cases is also crucial to reducing bitcoin’s volatility, but is by no means guaranteed and may take a long time to play out,” analysts Mikhail Sprogis and Jeffrey Currie wrote.Goldman says such conditions will be a smaller drag on the price of gold as it is a “shorter duration real asset with developed user cases,” adding that the metal “may benefit from structurally higher macro volatility and a need to diversify equity exposure.”The cryptocurrency’s adoption has been boosted by easy financial conditions, the bank said, with some investors more willing to “explore low liquidity, high risk/return options like bitcoin.” With tighter financial conditions expected moving forward, speculative interest in bitcoin is likely to decline.Bitcoin is more levered to financial conditions than gold because the metal has “developed non-investment cases today while bitcoin is still looking for one,” the note said, adding that BTC is a “solution looking for a problem.” The majority of bitcoin supply has not moved for over a year, which suggests that it is being held for investment purposes, the note added.Read more: Goldman: Regulators Should Protect Crypto Investors at the Point of Trust, Not the Blockchain",2022/12/13
155,"The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release the all-important Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for November at 8:30 a.m. ET (13:30 UTC) on Tuesday.If the inflation report comes hot, risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC), may face selling pressure. On the contrary, bitcoin could rally if data shows inflation showing signs of responding to the Federal Reserve's rate hike cycle.In other words, the CPI release could wake up bitcoin from its recent slumber. Trading giant Cumberland recommends an options strategy to profit from the post-data price action.""Sell BTC June calls and hedge with December options,"" Cumberland said in the CPI preview published on dominant crypto options exchange Deribit's market insights blog.The CPI is likely to show the cost of living rose by 7.3% in November on an annual basis, slowing from the 7.7% rise in the previous month. The core inflation, which excludes food and energy, likely rose 6.1% following October's 6.3% increase.To the uninitiated, bullish call options give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Meanwhile, put options give the right to sell.A call buyer compensates the call seller for offering protection against bullish moves by paying a premium when the contract is purchased. The premium received is the call seller's maximum profit, while the maximum loss is unlimited, as, in theory, the market can rise to infinity.Calls gain value when the market rises and bleed when the market drops. Seasoned traders sell higher strike or above-spot price call options when the market is expected to fall or stay flat.In the trade suggested by Cumberland, the June expiry calls will lose premium, making money for the call seller, if the data shows inflation remained elevated in November. A hotter-than-expected print would dash hopes for a Fed pivot in favor of rate cuts, pushing bitcoin lower and eroding the value of calls.""There is reason to believe that a high CPI print on Tuesday could be a tipping point, giving risk assets a strong reason to move back towards the downside and thus generating delta P&L through call selling,"" Cumberland noted.At this point, the obvious question that comes to mind is, what if the CPI misses estimates, bolstering hopes for the Federal Reserve pivot and lifting bitcoin? In that case, wouldn't the June call options gain value, yielding a big loss for the seller?While call options stand to gain value in case of a bitcoin rally, the rate of gain is likely to be tepid.That's because the implied volatility, or the market's forecast of a potential movement in the underlying asset, is expected to drop following Tuesday's CPI and Wednesday's Fed rate decision. A drop in implied volatility, which can be equated with lesser uncertainty, benefits options sellers.""A low CPI should reassert the market’s confidence in inflation coming down, causing a rally in risk assets but bringing vols [implied volatility] down again (generating vega P&L through call selling) as this narrative is already somewhat priced in,"" Cumberland said.Options vega measures the amount of increase or decrease in premium based on a 1% (100 basis points) change in the implied volatility (IV) assumption. A call buyer is long vega and stands to benefit from a rise in implied volatility, which can be equated with the degree of uncertainty. On the contrary, a call seller is short vega and will benefit from a drop in implied volatility.Besides, Cumberland favors buying short-dated options as a hedge against the risk of a potential blowup in volatility in the aftermath of the CPI report.""One can hedge this trade by buying some gamma (short-dated options expiring in December). The low levels of realized volatility have made the weekly straddle prices reasonably cheap compared to historical levels during data week,"" Cumberland noted.""This Friday’s BTC and ETH straddles are priced at 0.0453 and 0.0642, respectively, implying approximate moves of 4.5% and 6.4%,"" Cumberland added, referring to bitcoin and ether.Straddles is an options strategy that involves buying both call and put options when they are cheap relative to historical standards and implied volatility is expected to rise. Buying a straddle is akin to taking a bullish bet on volatility.Readers, however, should note that employing complex options strategies requires active management of position and ample capital supply. That's probably the reason why options market is dominated by institutions and sophisticated traders.",2022/12/13
156,"Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, endured a wave of withdrawals on Monday amid concerns about its proof of reserve report.Net outflows, the difference between the value of assets arriving and leaving the exchange, hit $902 million in the past 24 hours, according to data by blockchain intelligence platform Nansen.Binance’s net outflow has surpassed those of all other centralized exchanges’ in the last 24 hours, and is almost nine times larger than the second largest outflow.The outflow was the highest for Binance since Nov. 13, two days after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection, according to data provided by blockchain data platform Arkham Intelligence.However, the outflow “doesn’t seem notably anomalous,” an Arkham analyst wrote in a Telegram chat, given that there are ostensibly $64 billions of assets on Binance.Withdrawals rose following a string of concerning news reports about Binance, and as investors have become increasingly cautious about their funds on centralized exchanges. The swift collapse of rival exchange FTX, piled on other industry debacles, has prompted other exchanges to prove that they are safeguarding customers’ assets.Binance released a report by auditing firm Mazars last week claiming that its bitcoin (BTC) reserves are overcollateralized.

Jump Trading tweeted on Nov 12. that the firm remained well-capitalized, but didn’t specify losses or capital exposure to FTX.",2022/12/13
157,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin returned to its perch comfortably above $17,000 after dipping earlier in the day amid a news report that Binance was the subject of a U.S. federal probe.Insights: QCP Capital founder Darius Sit told a Tapei Blockchain Week audience that he does not see a recovery before 2024.Bitcoin Continues Its Side WaysBy James RubinA day before they will have a clearer view of the inflation landscape, investors had to reckon with the crypto industry's latest storm clouds: a report that Binance is the subject of a U.S. Justice Department probe, and later Monday, the arrest of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.Bitcoin tumbled below $16,900 at one point before recovering to recently trade at about $17,235, up slightly over the past 24 hours. BTC has spent much of the past two weeks clinging to support above $17,000 and seems likely to continue its tenacious ways for at least another day when the Bureau of Labor Statistics announces November's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.Inflation has shown signs of continuing its downward trend of recent months. On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve will likely drop its latest interest rate increase to 50 basis points (bps) from its current streak of 75 bps hikes, although markets are likely to remain nervously watchful for the time being.""It's a strong risk-off environment, not just in crypto but across every industry and in every country around the world,"" Hany Rashwan, CEO of 21.co, the parent company of crypto exchange-trading fund firm 21 Shares, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""The easiest way of thinking about this is [in] the last 10 years money has been cheaper to acquire, to borrow. As interest rates go up, the value of money becomes higher, so it becomes harder to get, and as a result people spend more carefully.""Yet, Rashwan added that his firm has ""been comforted internally by the plateauing of the bitcoin price within a specific band.""Ether followed a similar pattern to bitcoin, falling earlier in the day before rebounding. The second-largest crypto by market value was recently changing hands at about $1,275, a small gain from Sunday, same time. Most other major cryptos were in the green, with MATIC, the token of layer 2 platform Polygon, and SUSHI, the token of the Sushiswap decentralized exchange, recently rising about 2% and 1%, respectively.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, was recently up 0.23%.U.S. equity indexes closed in an upbeat mood about inflation and the Federal Reserve's expected dovish turn. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively.Meanwhile, according to Reuters, the Justice Department has discussed possible plea deals with Binance's lawyers. Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Seattle began investigating Binance in 2018 after a spate of cases that saw criminals use Binance to transfer illicit funds, according to Reuters. Other prosecutors believe that more evidence needs to be gathered before a criminal case can be filed, causing a split within the Department of Justice.Late Monday, the Bahamian Attorney General's office announced the arrest of Bankman-Fried. ""SBF's arrest followed receipt of formal notification from the United States that it has filed criminal charges against SBF and is likely to request his extradition,"" the office wrote in a release. ""As a result of the notification received and the material provided therewith, it was deemed appropriate for the Attorney General to seek SBF's arrest and hold him in custody pursuant to our nation's Extradition Act.""Genesis Shakeout Will Determine When Crypto Can ReboundBy Sam ReynoldsEverything that could go wrong in crypto has gone wrong in crypto, QCP Capital’s founder and chief investment officer said during a panel at Taipei Blockchain Week. But there are still uses for the asset class, and ""green shoots"" are emerging.“We are in a credit crisis triggered by LUNA and UST,” QCP’s Darius Sit said on stage, referring to the Terra token and algorithmic stablecoin. “This means there are cascading effects on everyone that had credit risks, and there are still some landmines in the space.”Sit said that he sees a great reset and washout caused by the credit crisis, which won't end until investors see whether Digital Currency Group (DCG) and its Genesis Global Trading unit are going to collapse or stay together. (DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk).“If this comes apart, there’s another round of defaults,” he said.Sit pegs a recovery happening around 2024, but macroeconomics will also play a role in this. He noted that the most successful appreciation of digital asset prices came during the COVID-19 pandemic when the U.S. Fed was enlarging its balance sheet. But now the opposite is happening.As far as the use cases and green shoots go, Sit points to the strength of the stablecoin industry, which Sit says has record revenue. There’s also the continued institutional adoption of the crypto options and derivatives market, where QCP is the most active.“The trading teams are all former [foreign exchange] people,” Sit said.If there’s one thing that not even a “dot-com bubble and 2008” can change, it's that everyone is now talking about crypto, Sit said. Meaning, from the cab driver to the banker to the former FX people now trading crypto options and derivatives.

BTC traded as low as $16,882 over the past 24 hours. Ether followed a similar pattern, sliding below $1,250 before regaining ground to trade at about $1,275, up slightly from Sunday, same time.Tron's decentralized algorithmic stablecoin (USDD): The USDD stablecoin, championed by Tron's founder Justin Sun and managed by Tron's decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), fell to slightly below 97 U.S. cents Monday, hitting its lowest level since June 22, according to data source CoinGecko. The decline violated the DAO's 3% price fluctuation threshold for price fluctuations to be considered de-pegs.Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink’s new “staking” program was intended to be broad-based by limiting each wallet to 7,000 LINK tokens. But blockchain data shows one large holder – a “whale,” in crypto parlance – recently was able to get around the limits by creating more than 150 addresses – and then staking the full 7,000 LINK allotment from each of them.

159,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a brief last week defending itself against claims its denial of Grayscale Investment’s application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) was “arbitrary, capricious and discriminatory.Grayscale filed suit against the SEC on June 29 – the same day the SEC rejected its application – and asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the SEC’s order. Grayscale is a sister company of CoinDesk.The suit was followed by a flurry of support from the wider crypto industry and beyond, and five amicus curiae (friend of the court) briefs were filed in the case.But the SEC is sticking to its guns. In the regulator’s first response brief since Grayscale filed suit, the SEC reiterated that its reasons for denying Grayscale’s applications were consistent with its earlier decisions to deny every other spot bitcoin ETF application it had received.Read more: Unpacking the Latest Bitcoin ETF RejectionsIn its lawsuit, Grayscale pointed to the SEC’s approval of several bitcoin futures ETFs to argue that greenlighting one type (futures ETFs) of instrument while rejecting the other (spot, or bitcoin-holding ETFs) was arbitrary, and thus a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).The SEC pushed back in its filing, arguing that “the two products are not the same” and have “fundamental differences in the ability to detect and deter fraud and manipulation,” that “reasonably support treating the two products differently.”Futures ETFs, unlike spot ETFs, are tradable only on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which the SEC pointed out is overseen by federal regulators and performs “extensive surveillance of the trading activity on its market.”The SEC also pointed to prior statements made by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that its permission to trade bitcoin futures “does NOT provide for … value judgements about the underlying spot market.”The SEC has long maintained that its denial of the ETF applications is largely due to the lack of regulatory oversight of the spot market, including surveillance-sharing agreements between a “regulated market of significant size” and a regulated exchange.Without proper oversight, the SEC has argued, spot ETFs could be vulnerable to “fraudulent and manipulative conduct,” including wash trading, price manipulation by “whales,” “malicious control of the bitcoin network,” hacking, insider trading, “manipulative activity involving purported ‘stablecoins’” and fraud at crypto exchanges.Grayscale and would-be spot ETF applicants that came before the SEC have argued the surveillance-sharing agreements the regulator wants aren’t necessary in the case of bitcoin, which they have argued has “novel protections” against fraud.But the SEC disagrees. In the filing last week, it pointed to statements made by Grayscale itself in its registration statement, which warns customers of the “unregulated nature and lack of transparency” surrounding the operations of spot-trading platforms, the risks of hacking and the risk of “fraud and manipulative activity” at bitcoin trading platforms.The SEC also highlighted a statement from the New York Stock Exchange that “fraud and manipulation may exist and that bitcoin trading on any given exchange may be no more uniquely resistant to fraud and manipulation than other commodity markets.”“Given these prior statements and the risks the Commission identified, the Commission concluded that NYSE Arca failed to substantiate its assertions regarding bitcoin’s purportedly novel anti-fraud properties,” the SEC wrote.Grayscale’s reply to the SEC is due on Jan. 13. The SEC’s response to Grayscale is due on Feb. 3.After all briefs have been submitted, the judge will review the SEC’s decision to reject Grayscale’s application and make a determination.As the lawsuit progresses, shares of Grayscale’s largest fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), are trading a record 47% discount to the value of the underlying cryptocurrency.",2022/12/12
160,"Bitcoin (BTC) investors should remain cautious.Historic pricing data for BTC suggests crypto winter will likely worsen next month. So far this month, bitcoin investors have suffered an average 0.08% daily loss, which is far lower than the 0.20% historic average for the month.Spread over 30 trading days, investors would lose 2.4% compared to the 6% gains they notched for bitcoin in past Decembers.Since 2014, bitcoin’s average daily returns have historically been the lowest in January. What’s made these dips less troublesome in past years is that December and February have traditionally been strong months for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Bitcoin has been hovering above $17,000 for the past two weeks, except for a two-day dip last week as investors mulled over the latest fallout from crypto exchange FTX’s collapse, and concerns about inflation.The price invariability and declining trading volume have highlighted investors’ fretfulness. They have been unwilling to forge more strongly into the market until they see firmer signs of macroeconomic improvement. Caution and risk aversion are the flavor du jour and bitcoin’s status as a hedge asset seems antiquated.By contrast, ether has generally performed well in January. Daily returns for the asset have averaged 0.49%, dating to 2017.This difference between ether and bitcoin is counterintuitive, given their normal tightly correlated pricing relationship.Moving from monthly to quarterly data offers a more mixed picture. Since 2014, January’s drag on BTC prices has led to a negative performance during the year’s first three months. However, from 2019 BTC’s performance has been positive in three of the four first quarters during this timeframe. Ether has generated positive average daily returns for every first quarter.Regardless, a weak December ahead of a traditionally weak January doesn’t offer great hopes for bullish bitcoin or ether investors. Whether February offers improvement remains unclear.",2022/12/12
161,"This year has certainly been a series of highs and lows for the crypto industry. After the 2021 bull run, we kicked off 2022 with a correction as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) dropped around 20% and 31%, respectively, in January alone. Macro factors, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes, high inflation, layoffs and generally slowing economic growth have led to much uncertainty. Rough market conditions largely became the standard for much of the year, but that didn’t stop crypto from many incredible technological achievements.Improvements in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector like the protocol Compound’s version (v)3 and the march of the zero-knowledge (ZK) ecosystem continued regardless. Institutional adoption of crypto has also occurred at a rapid pace, with Disney, Starbucks, Adidas and many other household brands quietly embracing blockchain. Large banks have also shown increasing interest in the sector: Fidelity launched a crypto service for investors, BlackRock partnered with Coinbase to bring its institutional clients crypto access and Goldman Sachs is creating a crypto data service.One industry highlight this year was the Ethereum Merge in September, where the blockchain transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, reducing Ethereum’s energy usage by an incredible 99.9%. Secondly, many amazing engineers continued to build through this bear market, and some of the strongest projects came out of it. Another benefit for the industry, though rough in the moment, was the lessons learned from each of the disasters that 2022 brought. Many projects – and even entire categories in crypto – have shown their resiliency in light of these events. If crypto has proven anything through its existence, though, it has proven that it can survive unfavorable times. Because of this, the industry will enter 2023 with a level of strength and durability that 2022 has given it.Paul Veradittakit is a general partner at investment firm Pantera Capital. This story is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 outlook.DeFi will continue to grow while CeFi consolidates: This past year exposed many of the problems of centralized finance (CeFi), while DeFi at large functioned flawlessly. In light of 2022’s many CeFi collapses, I expect the industry to consolidate into highly regulated players such as Coinbase and Bitstamp.In the period following the FTX collapse, DeFi transactions have already spiked, with volumes up 68% (to $97 billion) from October to November. Events like these prove the case for DeFi: governing assets via secure smart contracts enables users to better understand liquidity flows and have more control over their investments.Come 2023, I believe we’ll see more complex and interesting applications of DeFi increase. A few exciting examples are GMX, a decentralized perpetual exchange, and 1inch Pro, a regulatory-compliant platform that connects traditional finance (TradFi) to DeFi. Next year will also likely bring more traction for use cases like self-custody wallets, synthetic assets, and prediction markets.Despite market conditions, the sector’s true strengths lie in its foundational infrastructure that powers transactions in a trustless and efficient way. These properties will greatly accelerate DeFi’s adoption and growth in 2023, especially in light of CeFi’s struggles this year.We will see tremendous ZK adoption and use cases: As the question of privacy comes to the forefront of the crypto industry, zero-knowledge technology has been particularly notable this year. ZK technology essentially uses a prover, a verifier and mathematical algorithms to prove something without revealing underlying information about the proof. Because blockchains are inherently transparent, this application is huge for the industry and allows many more interactions to take place on-chain in a private way. ZK proofs are also extremely lightweight, making on-chain interactions much more scalable and efficient.With projects such as Succinct Labs, Risczero and Espresso Systems emerging, we’ve seen use cases for ZK proofs, VMs and rollups explode. ZK technology has particularly beneficial applications for identity as a crypto vertical. With ZK proofs, users are able to prove their identity on-chain without having to reveal sensitive data. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also noted in a recent piece how huge ZK technology is for solving the on-chain information problem – but that the category is “something that will actually need to be worked on.”ZK technology is also valuable for bridges, which are able to transmit messages and tokens while guaranteeing security and correctness via succinct proofs. There are also exciting applications for TradFi systems like credit scores and taxes.Institutions will increasingly tokenize financial assets: Real-world assets (RWA) are financial primitives that represent a claim on an underlying asset and often produce yield for that asset. The emergence of the category has unlocked huge amounts of liquidity and utility so far, and 2023 will likely bring more assets represented on-chain in an accessible manner.Stablecoins are arguably the most popular application of a RWA in today’s market, with the category constituting three of the top seven tokens by market capitalization. Circle’s USDC and Maker’s DAI have been top-tier stablecoins and have both seen almost no volatility throughout the bear market.On-chain communities have demonstrated demand for RWAs: for example, MakerDAO decided in mid-2022 to invest $500 million worth of DAI into U.S. treasuries and corporate bonds. Goldfinch, a company that provides loans that are collateralized off-chain, currently has an active loan value of ~$100 million. Jia allows business owners to take out blockchain-based loans and generates substantial yields for liquidity providers backed by real-world businesses and assets. I expect 2023 to bring the growth of interesting applications of RWAs, such as flash loans and real estate. In-line with the real world asset trend, I also expect to see a surge of startups focused on bringing TradFi institutions into crypto in a regulatory-compliant way.More companies will emerge to leverage blockchain data: Arguably, rich and open-source data is one of the blockchain’s best features, as it allows for deep analysis of on-chain activity. Leveraging this data in an efficient and responsible way is integral to the expansion of blockchain dapps and their use cases. Data reveals a massive amount about how blockchains are used, emerging trends, user behavior, and on-chain money flows.Blockchain analytics platforms like Nansen will continue to be critical for understanding on-chain analytics through wallet activity. Companies such as nxyz are also tackling blockchain indexing by providing data APIs with no rate limits. Definitive emerged in 2022 to provide user acquisition tooling and insights for both on-chain and off-chain activity. Even with the growth of these companies, blockchain data is still largely untapped and I expect to see significant developments in the sector during 2023. To understand where crypto is going next, we need to get granular with our level of data analysis of the state of the industry as it is right now.The developer tooling stack will continue to grow as blockchain engineers increasingly seek easy and efficient ways to deploy Web3 projects: Developer tooling eliminates many repetitive and tedious parts of the job and encourages more engineers to experiment with creating on-chain protocols. Companies including Alchemy and Tenderly have been particularly critical players in the sector this past year.Despite the bear market, developers have experimented with on-chain applications more than ever. Alchemy recently stated that it saw the number of engineers using its platform soar three times since the start of the year. In September 2022, monthly verified smart contracts were up 2.6 times, year over year. Impressively, 2022 also saw 36% of total smart contracts ever deployed and verified.As a greater number of Web3 developers get involved in the ecosystem, it is critical to provide them with sturdy tooling as they begin to build. Cross-chain tooling is particularly relevant, as it provides composable software that makes launching projects on multiple chains easy. By serving as the backbone for many crypto projects, developer tooling will continue to grow in 2023 as more crypto use cases arise and an increasing number of engineers seek to enter the industry.Non-fungible tokens that provide some kind of value to their holder, such as gaming NFTs and identity NFTs, will expand: Utility NFTs, such as in-game NFTs, identity tokens, and token-gated communities, software, and events will expand in 2023. This year, we’ve seen the sector start to develop technologically and creatively, but the space is nowhere near mainstream adoption. While the digital (pure) art industry is undoubtedly a massive vertical, using NFTs to permit specific privileges has the potential to disrupt many incumbent sectors.We’ve seen some exciting applications and developments of these ideas so far. Proof Collective allows its NFT holders to access future Proof drops (one of which was the popular Moonbirds NFT project) and access to Proof community initiatives, such as in-person events and a private Discord. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also released a formative paper on soulbound tokens (NFTs that hold on-chain identity information), which some projects have already adopted. Gaming transactions also skyrocketed in 2022, at one point composing over half of all blockchain activity. Further, NFTs are starting to be explored in the context of entertainment, specifically for fan engagement.Traditional companies have been exploring adoption of NFTs at an increasingly rapid pace. A few highlights: Tiffany’s released a collection of pendants for CryptoPunk holders, Instagram announced that it will incorporate NFTs into its platform and Nike acquired metaverse fashion company RTFKT. Royal has redefined music revenue streams and ownership by allowing fans to invest directly into songs. In addition, sports players including Cristiano Ronaldo have dropped NFT collections to drive up fan engagement and potentially give access to other future perks.In 2023, I’m excited to see industry disruption and ideas for utility NFTs fleshed out even further. Cryptonative applications, as well as traditional companies, will likely start to experiment more with using NFTs to bring something valuable to their owners.At the end of 2021, I made predictions about the growth of six sectors listed below. Here’s how I score myself on accuracy, with 1 being the least accurate and 5 being the most accurate.Layer 2s and Rollups, both ZK and optimistic, will continue to expand in the coming yearAccuracy: 4Layer 2s have seen incredible growth this year. Though Ethereum underwent the Merge, its gas fees were essentially unchanged, meaning layer 2s are still critical for decreasing the financial barrier to entry to interact on-chain.Layer 2s account for an impressive 30%-40% of Ethereum transactions, and around $250 million flows into layer 2s monthly. Arbitrum and Optimism have been particularly dominant players – both of the networks saw their TVL surpass Solana’s this year. Arbitrum also had an incredible 516% growth in active developer teams since January. Further, cumulative volume traded on all StarkEx platforms has skyrocketed to $775 billion since launch. However, the sector wasn’t completely immune from the effects of the bear: total value locked on layer 2s on Ethereum was down 30%+, from ~$7.3 billion in January to ~$5 billion in late October.Non-Ethereum/Bitcoin chains will become larger players in DeFi, gaming, and moreAccuracy: 4Ethereum’s share of TVL versus alternative layer 1 chains (altchains) has mostly stayed flat between ~50% and ~58% throughout 2022. 2021 saw explosive growth of alternative chains, with Ethereum’s share of TVL dropping ~20%. 2022 has been flatter, with Ethereum retaining around the same share for the year versus competing altchains. Part of this may be due to the Ethereum Merge, where the network switched from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and subsequently made the chain a more attractive option.Though Ethereum maintained its TVL share, many layer 1s did emerge in 2022, promising higher transaction fees and lower gas fees. Two notable examples are Sui and Aptos, both founded by ex-Meta developers (specifically Diem). The projects collectively raised $450 million+ in funding in 2022 and have seen huge amounts of attention and ecosystem growth since launch.I noted last year that Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) platforms have allowed Ethereum dapps to seamlessly launch on other EVM-compatible chains. This technology continues to show its strength, as it essentially eliminates the need to rebuild a dapp from the ground up to ensure that it is compatible with a given layer 1’s tech stack. In 2022, EVM has driven efficiency and interoperability on the development side as well as improved functionality and more seamless liquidity flows for users. Recent data also shows that EVM-compatible chains experienced more activity than non-EVM compatible chains.Composability and Web3 will continue to gain traction as crypto’s use cases growAccuracy: 4Last year, I speculated on the growth of the Web3 sector, which in general is a blanket term which refers to blockchain and crypto-enabled technologies. This prediction was largely accurate as we saw composability/interoperability popularize massively in 2022. Projects like Succinct have done a fantastic job reducing friction by allowing for seamless communication between protocols.Web3 also made huge strides as companies including CreatorDAO, Arpeggi Labs, and Arkive redefined ownership, collaboration mechanisms, and monetization streams. Developers are continually experimenting with fresh use cases for crypto: Ethers.js was downloaded ~948,000 times so far in 2022, a 212% increase since 2021, and web3.js was downloaded ~587,000 times, a 137% increase since 2021. In addition, powerful new revenue streams for creators, financial mechanisms like co-ownership, and identity and social tools were brought to the market in 2022. Companies including Farcaster and Lens Protocol made Web3 social a less complex and more palatable sector by providing users better UI/UX and offering unique, crypto-enabled ways to interact.Expansion of NFTs will be a dominant trend in 2022Accuracy: 2NFTs were definitely all the buzz in 2021, but the sector didn’t fare quite as well in 2022. From the fourth quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022, the total number of NFT sales was down ~46%, from ~14 million to 7 million. Another notable stat reveals that NFT trading volumes have decreased 97% from all-time highs. Additionally, in Sept. 2022, OpenSea saw trade volume decrease 99% since May highs. Many metaverse NFT companies have been struggling as well; for example, digital fashion giant RTFKT saw sales decrease from roughly 14,000 ETH in February to 154 ETH in November.However, the year definitely did see expansion in utility, gaming, and music NFTs, as well as creative new applications for utility NFTs, such as soulbound tokens, token-gated communities and events, and co-ownership mechanisms. In addition, 2022 saw the launch of Sudoswap, a novel and permissionless NFT exchange for trading NFTs via an AMM design. The royalty-free platform saw more than 7,000 transactions in one day at its peak in August, representing over $3 million. Uniswap also recently introduced NFTs on their platform with an aggregator that supports OpenSea, Sudoswap, and X2Y2, among others. Overall, the year brought many creative new takes on how NFTs can be used, despite the category’s sluggish transaction volume.The DAO space will continue to see growth in complexity and use casesAccuracy: 4Both the number of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) – and the number of companies tackling DAO tooling – have grown significantly in 2022. The total number of DAOs skyrocketed from 700 in May of 2021 to more than 6,000 in June of this year, and companies such as Utopia Labs, Coordinape, and Layer3, among others, have made it easy to deploy and manage a DAO.The total market cap of all DAO tokens was roughly $21 billion in Jan. 2022, with the top five DAO tokens constituting $13.2 billion of that number – revealing that value is largely concentrated in only a few quality DAOs. Uniswap, the leading DAO in terms of treasury size, saw its treasury decrease from $2.9 billion at the end of 2021 to $2.3 billion in late Nov. 2022. Most DAO treasuries have followed suit during the bear market, but the sector has shown resilience. Analytics reveal that more than 2,850 DAOs began governance activities from May to Oct. 2022, and in general, more DAOs were created this year than last (on a month-by-month basis). Because incentive structures, use cases, and governance look different for every DAO, the sector is still evolving rapidly and we’re continually seeing fresh takes on what it means to operate as a DAO.Security will be integral for strengthening the DeFi ecosystemAccuracy: 3The Ronin bridge hack in March 2022, where attackers stole $625 million, constituted a higher amount than the roughly $610 million stolen in malicious DeFi exploits in all of 2021. In total, 2022 saw more than $3 billion worth of digital assets stolen, as of Nov. 1. The sheer number of DeFi security companies has certainly increased in 2022, and their tech stacks have improved; however, explosive DeFi growth led to more targeted hacks than ever as the industry expanded.We’ve undoubtedly seen more innovation in the sector as companies such as Quantstamp, CertiK, and OtterSec continually secure the industry via mechanisms such as formal verification, smart contract auditing tooling, and white-hat hacking.However, the spotlight remains on crypto security. In the midst of continued exploits, the FBI cautioned investors of potential platform hacks and asked DeFi platforms to improve security measures. Crypto cannot go totally mainstream unless it becomes secure; 2022 was largely disappointing in terms of hacks, but we did see more companies emerging and strengthening to tackle the issue.Despite some painful hacks and CeFi crashes, the crypto industry as a whole made huge technological strides in 2022. Even through the harsh crypto winter, Web3 has reached an incredible amount of individuals – and the technology is clearly here to stay. Our job as an industry is to make that technology accessible, reliable and safe for users around the world in order to usher in an era of financial transparency, dependability, and autonomy. Web3 continues to redefine how we think about money, ownership (of both physical and digital assets), identity, and community. I’m very excited to see what 2023 brings as we continue to accelerate the adoption of an economic layer to the internet.",2022/12/12
162,"Bitcoin mining firm Argo Blockchain (ARBK) is in advanced negotiations to sell some of its assets and carry out an equipment financing transaction to strengthen its balance sheet and improve its liquidity, the company said in a filing with the London Stock Exchange Monday.The London-based company said it is hopeful it will be able to make these moves outside of a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the U.S., but there is no reassurance it will be able to do so.Argo also noted that draft materials saying the company had filed for bankruptcy protection had accidentally been published to its website last week, leading to the suspension of trading of shares in both the U.K. and U.S. on Friday.The company is now requesting that its listing in the U.K. be restored, and expects that to happen “as soon as practicable.” The miner's shares had already lost about 94% of their value in the past year, underperforming the rest of the industry.As part of the process, the company has hired McDermott Will & Emery LLP as legal advisers, Berkeley Research Group, LLC as financial advisers and Stifel GMP and its affiliate, Miller Buckfire & Co., LLC, as investment bankers.Argo has been trying to raise $25 million to $35 million since late August. In November it became clear it needed the funds to survive. After a deal for $27 million fell through in October, the firm warned it might soon have negative cash flow.Argo has built a mega bitcoin mining facility in West Texas, dubbed Helios. The facility started operations in May with a plan to reach 800 megawatts (MW) of energy consumption and 20 exahash/second (EH/s) of computing power. This would have made Argo one of the world's biggest miners.However, problems quickly emerged, and the firm found costs from the facility outpacing revenue, such that margins narrowed in the following few months. That has been a common issue in the industry as the price of energy has soared and the price of bitcoin has slumped. Argo felt the effect of soaring energy prices particularly hard as it didn't have a fixed-rate power agreement for the Helios facility.Argo also has two smaller facilities in Canada's Quebec province.",2022/12/12

164,"Before 2022, sanctions in crypto sounded somewhat extravagant. While governments around the world have been after this industry for quite a while, it still seemed that cryptocurrencies, by their initial promise of privacy, freedom and censorship resistance, wouldn’t become as politicized as the fiat system.Then 2022 showed how naive those expectations were.This story is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 outlook.“It became very clear that crypto needs to pay attention to sanctions and the consequences of not doing it can be significant,” says Daniel Tannebaum, partner at the Oliver Wyman consulting firm. He believes we will see more enforcement actions related to sanctions, and the mainstream crypto industry will need to keep adjusting to that reality.Crypto felt its first chill of sanctions in 2021 when Virgil Griffith, an Ethereum developer, arrested earlier for speaking at a North Korean blockchain conference, pleaded guilty to helping the rogue regime evade sanctions.The same year, Ethereum projects’ incubator ConsenSys banned Iranian students from a blockchain coding course, and fundraising platform Gitcoin shut down a campaign aimed at Farsi-speaking Ethereum coders.This April, Griffith finally got his verdict: a sentence of 63 months in prison.For the Ethereum community, Griffith’s case was just the beginning. In August, Tornado Cash, an Ethereum-based mixer, was blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The reason: The mixer was used by the Lazarus hacker group linked to North Korea. It was not the first mixer sanctioned this year. But because Tornado Cash is a noncustodial, open-source tool, the incident provoked outrage in the crypto community.Probably the most high-profile crypto sanction case to date, Tornado Cash sanctioning provoked a backlash. The think tank Coin Center and U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase sued OFAC, claiming it had overstepped its authority and deprived Americans of their right for private use of cryptocurrency.OFAC, for its part, believes that neither the open-source nature of the Tornado Cash code, nor the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) managing the protocol’s updates is a reason not to deem it a money-laundering entity that must be sanctioned.“OFAC also kept the door open for DAOs and other decentralized organizations to be viewed as ‘entities’ for sanctions designations and enforcement actions. We are likely to see this come up again if OFAC targets the [decentralized finance] space,” says Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at blockchain intel firm TRM Labs. The sanctions severely hurt the popularity of Tornado Cash, with monthly deposits to it falling by 68%, Redbord added.The crypto community noted that innocent people who used Tornado Cash ended up with their money locked in the sanctioned wallets. In response, OFAC published a guidance, suggesting such users apply for a license to withdraw funds – in other words, deanonymize themselves and their wallets, effectively defeating the whole point of using a mixer.The success of such a procedure, however, is not guaranteed. The users of the sanctioned Russian exchange Chatex, whose money got frozen in the custodian wallet in 2021, applied for their licenses one year ago and are still waiting for resolution.We have yet to see what happens when you ask OFAC to release your crypto from a sanctioned wallet – and what happens afterwards. Tornado Cash is a test of the promise.Tornado Cash was also the first case when a blockchain coder went to jail for his product. Alexey Pertsev, a Tornado Cash developer and one the founders of PepperSec, a company that created the mixer, was arrested in the Netherlands in August and remains in custody as of today.The Dutch public prosecutor voiced the position of law enforcement: Pertsev and his co-founders knew Tornado was used by bad actors, they owned a majority of protocols’ governance tokens and therefore could enforce anti-money-laundering measures but chose not to.While Tornado Cash had a website with user-friendly interface, on which, technically, it was possible to implement know your customer/anti-money-laundering (KYC/AML) features (even considering the absurdity of such an idea for a crypto mixer), its smart contracts code is open source. Users can deploy it without going to a specific website as well as copy it and clone the service, using other, not-yet-sanctioned wallets.This poses the most critical question of the case: Can releasing an open-source code, which can be used by bad actors, be a criminal offense? And, if yes, what does that mean for software developers around the globe? The nature of open-source software means the creator only puts it out there and has no power or responsibility over how people use it.Whether creating the Tornado Cash code will be a part of Pertsev’s final charges (and not just maintaining the website and wallets) and whether the court decides it is a valid accusation will mean a lot for the future of open-source development.“It became clear that the U.S. government is not fond of mixers,” Tannebaum, at Oliver Wyman, said.The war in Ukraine precipitated another wave of U.S. sanctions, this time against Russia, which started the conflict in February, provoking global outrage. As the Western countries have been trying to help out Ukraine and limit Russia’s capacity to wage war, financial sanctions have been applied to both high-profile Russian individuals and the country as a whole.In particular, global payment providers Visa and Mastercard, as well as payment services such as Western Union, stopped sending money to and from Russia, to a significant extent isolating the country’s financial system from the world. In October, the European Union banned crypto exchanges from serving Russian citizens and residents.Immediately, a bunch of services licensed in the EU, such as Blockchain.com, LocalBitcoins, Crypto.com, Dappers Lab and Kraken, informed their Russian users they’re no longer welcome.As with any blanket sanctions, a number of people not involved in anything nefarious got thrown under that bus. Among them, some independent journalists and human rights activists protesting the war, who left Russia when the war started and now are using crypto as a remittance tool of last resort.Now, a number of U.S. crypto businesses are discussing banning Russian nationals from their platforms, even though the U.S. law doesn’t require it at this point, Tannebaum saidThe discussions go this way, Tannebaum explains: “The EU, U.K. and U.S. sanctions on Russia are not perfectly aligned. So to operate across these jurisdictions, do we even want to go through the headache to navigate what is permissible and what is not permissible? We may just ban the clients outright.”Russians I spoke to believe this is unfair; Ukrainians insist that whatever inflicts pain on Russia and Russians is helping to stop the war. Without discussing the gruesome reality that led to this whole situation, it’s worth reminding that Ukrainians themselves have been indiscriminately shadow-banned from U.S. crypto services recently.For several years, U.S.-based exchanges have refused to serve Ukrainians because Ukraine had a sanctioned territory within its borders. That was the Crimea peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, and therefore sanctioned by the West. It is still considered a part of Ukraine by most of the world.So Ukraine, in addition to losing a part of its territory, was effectively penalized for formally owning it! The country’s deputy minister of digital transformation had to write to then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asking him to do something about the anomaly – to no avail for at least another year.If you remember the case of Iranians banned from learning to code Ethereum blockchain by the cautious U.S. companies, you might see the problematic nature of blanket nation-wide crypto sanctions, and even more problematic implementation by crypto entities that would always prefer the public outrage to the ire of an (already not too friendly) regulator.2023 will show if we are about to see more black spaces on the crypto map.The initial thesis that Russians might use crypto en masse to evade sanctions were proved unfounded, says Tannebaum. “The firms that are doing analytics in this space haven’t found evidence of any sort of mass movement out of the traditional banking sector,” he added.However, the sheer proportion of risk and reward from servicing a citizen of a sanctioned nation might encourage exchanges to err on the side of caution.“We are likely to continue to see OFAC engage in enforcement actions against exchanges that do not have the right tools in place to mitigate the risks of sanctions exposure and see OFAC use sanctions offensively as well to deter hacks and the laundering of hacked funds,” TRM Labs’ Redbord believes.There is no sign the sanctions pressure on crypto will get any lower in foreseeable future – on the contrary, the U.S. government, for one, believes crypto services must be proactively banning users when they see “clearly observable red flags” and not to wait for the government agencies to guide their hand.An approach like this might soon make crypto exchanges and other services very similar to banks, effectively excluding “risky” clients and leaving many people frozen out of the financial system.And it looks like the exchanges will be given the strongest incentives to “de-risk” as hard as they can. Only this fall, two U.S. exchanges, Bittrex and Kraken, had to settle with OFAC and pay fines for failing to prevent Iranians from using their exchanges.Major U.S. exchanges have been hiring compliance professionals from the banking sector for a while now, Tannebaum said, so it is no surprise “they’re starting to look at how to quantify risk in a manner consistent with the banking sector’s more mature practices.”Does it mean crypto will be purified of crime and the political untouchables? Chances are, it won’t be. There will always be a market of shadow over-the-counter (OTC) brokers willing to process crime-related and sanctioned crypto. That has been the way the infamous Conti ransomware hacker group used, for example.Those brokers, in turn, still need big exchanges with lots of liquidity to operate, and the exchanges would look the other way only until a certain point. That was the case with SUEX, the sanctioned Russian OTC that used Binance – and was banned.However, AML tools, based on blockchain analytics systems, still allow some space for covering traces, which “will inevitably have some success no matter how sophisticated the controls,” Redbord says.Blacklisting a blockchain address does not automatically mean freezing money on it: the owner of the addresses’ private key still can move funds, sell them peer-to-peer and swap on decentralized marketplaces that do not implement KYC/AML procedures.In February, Canadian authorities blacklisted 34 blockchain addresses with funds raised by the so-called Freedom Convoy truckers. But it didn’t prevent the owners from moving the funds and at least trying to cash them out through exchanges like Crypto.com and Coinbase (the exchanges declined to comment on the fate of the funds).Another example: The arrest of people behind BTC-e, the exchange linked to the Mt. Gox hack, did not prevent someone from spending money from the long-asleep BTC-e wallet in November.In the near future, compliance tools will be getting more sophisticated, making life for sanctioned users harder and harder, Redbord said.So the cat and mouse game will likely only get more intense in the years to come. Only the hunter will get ever hungrier, and the population of prey ever larger and more heterogenous.At the start of the war, Ukraine tried to block another money channel for Russians. The country’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, asked Tether to freeze any transactions related to Russia. Tether did not abide.It’s not clear whether it’s even technically tangible to locate and freeze all funds and transactions belonging to owners of a certain nationality or territory (given the existence of anonymizing tools). But Tether, which maintains tether (USDT) stablecoin smart contracts in a centralized fashion, can blacklist addresses and block funds on them.Another, earlier attempt of protocol-level implementation of sanctions was an initiative of one single American miner Marathon, which announced last May its “OFAC pool” will only mine sanctions-free transactions. The idea was immediately ridiculed by bitcoiners and abandoned in less than a month. However, it doesn’t mean ideas of this sort won’t be entertained – and successfully implemented – in the future.Economist John Paul Koning believes that stablecoins, which by design are mostly centralized, will be the primary target for sanctions in the future.“Going forward, I'd suspect that a greater share of OFAC digital currency designations will explicitly target stablecoins rather than ether or bitcoin, since stablecoins have become the preferred medium of exchange in the crypto ecosystem,” Koning told CoinDesk.Sanctions on the level of protocols would be much more powerful than on the level of service providers. We have yet to see whether the regulators will be pressing developer teams to do it and whether protocol maintainers will abide. That would create a whole new reality where you may not only get banned from an exchange but also find your crypto wallet frozen, just like a bank account.Government authorities would probably love that level of control. And in this case, fully decentralized networks like Bitcoin would seem to regulators like an odd inconvenience once again. There might be a big temptation to go after bitcoin and discourage people from using it.Crypto has to brace for more various and complex battles ahead, with odds not always in its favor. It will require a lot of integrity on the part of the crypto community to preserve at least islands of privacy and personal sovereignty in this future world.",2022/12/12

166,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin was trading steady over $17K as investors awaited the latest Consumer Price Index report and U.S. central bank interest rate decision.Insights: Uniswap's governance proposal to pilot turning on a “fee switch” has received mostly positive reactions, but the community remains cautious.As Big Events Approach, Bitcoin Trades Sideways to Hold Over $17KBy James RubinCrypto markets remained calm over the weekend as investors girded themselves for what will likely be the last significant events on 2022's inflation front, the release of November's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Tuesday and the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision a day later.Bitcoin was recently trading at $17,114, slightly below where it stood 24 hours earlier, and when it started the weekend. With just a couple of glitches, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has held firmly above $17,000 for the past two weeks as the fallout from crypto exchange FTX's implosion and other industry debacles has slowed.In an email to CoinDesk, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, noted that bitcoin has managed to hold the ""17K threshold,"" although the CPI, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate verdict, as well as the U.S. Labor Department's latest jobless claims report on Thursday could affect prices.""With these key events coming up, volatility is expected but the bias remains to the upside and we’d like to see $20K on the top and respect for $16K at the bottom,"" DiPasquale wrote.Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,275, also roughly unmoved from the previous day and when the weekend kicked off. Other major cryptos were trading slightly to the red, with decentralized network Cosmos' ATOM recently falling more than 4% and popular meme coin DOGE off 3.6%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently sank nearly 0.5%.Stocks closed down on Friday following an unexpectedly large rise in November's producer price index (PPI), which calculates monthly wholesale prices. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.4%, higher than Wall Street expectations of 0.2%, suggesting that central bank measures to tame inflation have not been fully effective. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 each dropped 0.7%.The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment offered a counterpoint to the gloom, rising to 59.1, higher than Dow Jones projections of 56.5. The index also signaled more upbeat attitudes about inflation.The CPI fell to 7.7% for October, although the decline was not enough to satisfy monetary hawks fearful about the long-term affects of stubborn inflation. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise the interest rate 50 basis points (bps), a decline from its recent diet of four consecutive rate increases 75 bps, although Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have reiterated their commitment to stem rising prices in recent weeks, and investors have fretted about the possibility of steeper, liquidity-squeezing rate hikes in 2023.BitBull's DiPasquale wrote that investors are already expecting a 50 bps lift, although it ""could rise further upon the [FOMC] announcement.""Uniswap 'Fee Switch' Proposal for Ether Pools Stirs Up Community DebateBy Shaurya MalwaA proposal by crypto exchange Uniswap to test whether reducing trading fees will result in significantly lower volume has attracted a lot of interest from community members and users.The proposal was put forward in July to pilot a ""fee switch"" for a small set of Uniswap protocol pools. The vote was postponed until Dec. 1 to allow more time for people to think about it. On Dec. 2, the vote moved forward and the decision was to go ahead with the test.The switch will not increase fees for users, but will retain a small portion of what is currently paid out to liquidity providers (LP), or users who lock up their tokens on Uniswap in exchange for fee rewards.The fee switch – if enabled considering the current conditions – could potentially mean lesser fee earnings for Uniswap’s liquidity providers and more rewards for holders of Uniswap’s native token UNI, which in turn accrues value for UNI holders.The proposal is a pilot program and is intended to evaluate the impact of turning on the fee switch on trade execution, on a small set of Uniswap pools that utilize USD coin (USDC), dai (DAI) and ether (ETH) over a 120-day period.The experiment will be considered a success, Uniswap’s developers said, if trading execution is not diminished for pools with the fee switch turned on. It is one of the many ongoing examples of community-led decisions that dictate the future growth of protocols like Uniswap.Meanwhile, community reactions remain mostly positive, albeit with caution.Some users in favor of the proposal said not moving ahead with the changes meant “stifling governance/revenue model innovation,” while some expressed concerns  that liquidity providers could pull their funds from the platform.One user called the proposal “a very important moment for Uniswap,” but opined that it was currently the “wrong time” to execute the move.“While we may identify that the fee switch does not or has a minimal negative impact on these metrics for certain pools, taxing LPs certainly cannot help here. I see only downside across the core KPIs,” the user, tagged as “Jack_Longarzo” on Uniswap’s governance forum, said.They added: “The other reason is that this proposal could have very serious and unpredictable negative externalities for the Uniswap community. The Uniswap Foundation’s brief discusses the severe lack of clarity for decentralized finance in the U.S. It is very possible that this proposal could negatively impact community members like Uniswap Labs, the Uniswap Foundation, and even individuals in the community. I don’t think the proposed exploration is justifiable amidst these uncertainties.”3:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:00 UTC) United Kingdom Gross Domestic Product (MoM/Oct)3:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(19:00 UTC) United States Monthly Budget Statement (Nov) 4:25 p.m. HKT/SGT(20:25 UTC) Bank of Canada's Governor Macklem SpeechIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Sam Bankman-Fried Agrees to Testify Before Lawmakers; Bitcoin Regains $17KSam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, tweeted he's ""willing"" to testify at a Dec. 13 House Financial Services Committee hearing.

167,"This week, David Solomon (DJ D-Sol if we’re using stage names), chairman and CEO of investment bank Goldman Sachs, proved he’s stuck in the past with a Wall Street Journal opinion piece he penned titled: “Blockchain Is Much More Than Crypto.” The article was published on the heels of Goldman saying it’s planning to spend “tens of millions” on discounted crypto investments.In the article, Solomon correctly points out that blockchain came in and disrupted heavily regulated industries like banks. Oddly, he goes on from there to claim that the deafening call for regulation means young “blockchain organizations” won’t be able to keep up with regulatory requirements. And that is especially true of cryptocurrencies, but we “shouldn’t miss the forest for the trees” – that is, we should recognize that blockchain can “support responsible innovation across the financial industry” without cryptocurrencies.We’ve heard that one before: “I don’t know about this bitcoin thing, but there’s surely some potential in the underlying blockchain technology!”You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.To defend his position, Solomon shared how Goldman Sachs used a private blockchain to arrange a 100 million euro two-year digital bond for the European Investment Bank that was settled in 60 seconds instead of the usual five days. Praise be to its private blockchain!The takeaway is supposed to be that Goldman will use a private blockchain to reduce settlement times, ultimately lowering costs for all stakeholders.Except.The reason bonds settle in five days is not because of the lack of a blockchain; it’s because of Goldman Sachs and regulation and bureaucratic red tape. Adding a private blockchain isn’t going to rid Goldman Sachs’ bond placement process of Goldman Sachs and regulation and bureaucratic red tape. Especially when that deafening call for regulation is answered.Sure, maybe adding a blockchain is a solution, but really, it’s not for one main reason: Private, permissioned blockchains are worse than useless.Read more: How I Lost My Faith in Private BlockchainsDon’t let anyone trick you; blockchains are not a complicated idea. If you know what a database is (an electronic repository of data), then you basically know what a blockchain is. Databases store data in a place. You or Goldman Sachs can access that data electronically if the database manager allows you access to that data. Otherwise, no data for you or Goldman Sachs.Blockchains are the same thing, but all the data is public and copies of the database are stored in many disparate places. In theory, just about anyone can join and maintain their own copy of the data on a computer they know and trust.If that sounds like a very narrow, minimal-potential use case and potentially slow technology, that’s because it is. There’s no need to allow everyone to have non-permissioned access to every piece of data all the time unless you are trying to get around needing a database manager or some other trusted third party to access that data. Something like digital money could be a good application of this technology.Anything else, you’re better off with a regular database.Really, the takeaway here is that blockchains are yet another round of narrow, minimal-potential-use-case technologies getting shoved into all sorts of broad applications where they simply shouldn’t be shoved. (Cue the conversation about pairing artificial intelligence with our drinking water, or whatever).Shipping company Maersk and tech giant International Business Machines tried to blockchain-ify supply chains and put tomatoes or bananas or whatever on the blockchain through a shipping blockchain called TradeLens (whatever that means). TradeLens failed and shut down two weeks ago after almost five years of trying. It failed because it didn’t reach “the level of commercial viability necessary to continue work and meet the financial expectations as an independent business” because the idea simply isn’t viable.I think the killer app for blockchain is decentralized money. Others think it's decentralized governance. These ideas come to life as unbanked women in Afghanistan seek financial freedom through Bitcoin and as crowdfunding efforts are organized to bid on things like the U.S. Constitution (a sillier example comparatively, sure, but pretty timely). The killer blockchain apps will most probably (and currently do) live on public, permissionless blockchains.All said, I can assure you of one thing: The killer app won’t come from private, permissioned blockchains used to settle bond placements by huge, multinational investment banks.",2022/12/11

Its native token FET’s price jumped from 6 cents at the start of the week to now 11 cents, surging 80% in the five days since Sunday and 36% in the past 24 hours alone at the time of publication. The price jump came after the release of an upgrade to the Fetch.ai wallet with features, including “more easy-to-use messaging,” “fewer server interactions” and “faster load times.”FTX Token (FTT): The native cryptocurrency of the failed FTX crypto exchange surged Friday after the platform's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, came out in support of an exchange revival plan proposed by a crypto influencer Ran Neuner. The FTT token surged as much as 47% to $1.97, its highest level since Nov. 16, after Bankman-Fried's tweet at 08:18 UTC, TradingView data show. The token has since settled back to $1.64.By Glenn Williams Jr.Both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were essentially flat over the last week, with the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value trading .005% and .006% higher than the last recorded price on Dec. 2. Volume for both has been stable, with trading activity falling slightly below their respective 20-day moving averages.BTC appears to be bumping up against potential resistance at current levels. A look at the asset’s Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) indicator indicates high levels of price agreement at current levels, which can lead to static price movement. If BTC breaks above this level, the next high volume node appears at the $20,000 level.ETH’s price, since hitting a short-term bottom on Nov. 22, is showing the early makings of a potential uptrend, with prices up 12% since that day.

171,"Symbiont.io, which almost a decade ago joined the rush of startups trying to bring crypto's underlying blockchain technology into conventional finance, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 1.The New York-based company said its assets and liabilities both ranged between $1 million and $10 million, according to a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for Southern District of New York.Originally named Math Money FX, the company was formed in 2013 to help financial institutions leverage the Bitcoin blockchain to ""reduce risk, save costs, and increase efficiencies,"" according to a company timeline. Early on, it raised money from finance titans including the former CEO of the New York Stock Exchange, and allowed investors to track the cap table (finance jargon for who owns how much of a privately held startup) using the Bitcoin network.Over the years, it continued to win partnerships with large institutions including index-fund giant Vanguard. Just last year, Vanguard and State Street used Symbiont's platform for a foreign exchange forward contract. And just a few months ago, SWIFT, which helps banks move money across borders, said it was using Symbiont's technology.But it apparently fell into distress amid the brutal bear market in crypto that's felled other players, too.",2022/12/09
172,"Prices and ChartsAfter last month’s extreme market plunge as Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange collapsed, some traders might be grateful for a bit of respite – in the form of a sideways-trading market.Both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were essentially flat over the last week, with the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value trading .005% and .006% higher than the last recorded price on Dec. 2. Volume for both has been stable, with trading activity falling slightly below their respective 20-day moving averages.BTC appears to be bumping up against potential resistance at current levels. A look at the asset’s Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) indicator indicates high levels of price agreement at current levels, which can lead to static price movement. If BTC breaks above this level, the next high volume node appears at the $20,000 level.ETH's price, since hitting a short-term bottom on Nov. 22 is showing the early makings of a potential uptrend, with prices up 12% since that day. A distinction between ETH and BTC’s recent price action is that ETH has pushed past a high volume node at $1,200 with the next stop above being at $1,340.Top 90-day performersAmong the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, your 90-day winners are dogecoin (DOGE), litecoin (LTC), XRP and Polygon's MATIC.The laggards are Polkadot's DOT, Avalanche's AVAX, Cardano's ADA and Solana's SOL.Bitcoin and ether are near the middle of the range, ranking 13th and 15th, respectively.Each leader is down versus the U.S. dollar over the last seven days, as are the laggards, except for SOL.CorrelationsBitcoin and ether prices remain tightly correlated at 0.96. Despite the differences between the two assets in supply, consensus mechanism, and utility, their prices continue to move in tandem. Other bitcoin correlations of note include:The week ahead …The upcoming week will have its share of headline-worthy moments.On Dec. 13, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee will hold part 1 of a hearing titled “Investigating the Collapse of FTX.” The embattled former CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, has agreed to testify before the committee, following the threat of a subpoena.The Senate Banking Committee will be holding its own FTX hearing the following day. Whether Bankman-Fried appears remains unclear.The threat of a Senate subpoena may have a similar effect to the House Financial Service Committee’s action.The impact of these events on crypto prices will be long term and connected to legislation arising from each committee’s findings.The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Dec. 14 may have a more immediate effect, although markets seem to have already priced in a 50-basis point rate hike. Investors will likely be eyeing the Fed funds futures rate curve following the meeting.Currently, markets anticipate that rates will reach 5% during the second and third quarters of 2023.",2022/12/09
173,"The Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s layer 2 scaling platform, has a privacy problem. Receiving payments, requesting refunds, and opening and closing payment channels (connections between Lightning nodes) – all raise privacy concerns for users of the payment network.Those concerns have inspired protocol-based solutions like “Basis of Lightning Technology 12” (BOLT 12), a proposed upgrade that not only enhances privacy but also introduces many other useful features. (BOLTs are Lightning draft proposals similar to Bitcoin improvement proposals or BIP.)Independent solutions have also sprung up – notably, lnproxy, an invoice privacy tool (invoices are simply payment requests), and LNURL, a suite of tools for enabling communication between various Lightning applications and services over the web.So what’s a privacy-focused Bitcoiner to do, rely on the fledgling BOLT 12 specification or turn to one of these independent tools?“The best thing about BOLT 12 and the technologies it relies on is that you won't need anything else,” Rusty Russell told CoinDesk. Russell is the lead developer of Core Lightning (CLN) at Bitcoin infrastructure firm, Blockstream. “Lightning nodes will give everyone the privacy they should have by default.”Read more: What Is Bitcoin's Lightning Network?“BOLT 12 adds a ton of functionality to Lightning invoices. It also adds privacy,” said Jack Sweeney, communications manager at LN Capital, creators of Torq – capital management software for Lightning routing nodes – in an interview with CoinDesk. “The real difference between BOLT 12 and something like lnproxy is that BOLT 12 is a protocol-based solution, whereas something like lnproxy is an application layer solution.”BOLT 12 introduces “offers” to the Lightning Network. According to the official BOLT 12 website, “offers are a precursor to an invoice” that enable key functionality such as reusable QR codes, the ability to both send and receive payments and of course, enhanced privacy.Reusable QR codes pave the way for use cases like recurring subscriptions and donations. Send and receive functionality can now be used for Lightning ATMs and private refunds. Finally, new features like route blinding, payer keys and Schnorr signatures will provide an extra layer of privacy.Currently, receiving a Lightning payment means sharing private details with the sender (via an invoice). Route blinding (also called “blinded paths”) makes it possible for the sender to make that same payment to an anonymous recipient by hiding details about the route or path a payment has taken.Lightning payments go from sender to receiver by “hopping” from one channel to the next via a series of Lightning nodes. With route blinding, each node only receives just enough information to pass the payment on to the next node until the payment reaches the recipient.How does a customer request a refund for a product or service they are unhappy with while keeping their identity private? Enter “payer keys.”Offers in BOLT 12 generate payer keys that prove the origin of an invoice without revealing the customer’s identity. Combine that with route blinding and you get enhanced privacy during the refund process.BOLT 12 uses Schnorr signatures, the central component in Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade. Schnorr signatures are a simpler and more efficient alternative to the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures that are still commonly used in Bitcoin today.When a Lightning channel is closed, the closing transaction is currently reflected as a 2-of-2 multisignature (multisig) transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. This metadata, together with additional information and some sophisticated sleuthing, can ultimately expose the personal financial data of private users.Schnorr signatures could potentially solve this issue by making Lightning transactions look like regular single-signature Bitcoin transactions via a signature scheme called MuSig2.Read more: Most Influential 2021: The Developers Who Wrote Bitcoin’s Taproot UpgradeAn anonymous developer has been quietly working on lnproxy, and although the project is new and limited in scope, it’s been gaining a few fans among Bitcoiners.The tool uses a feature called “wrapped” invoices to hide the destination of a Lightning payment or conceal the identity of a sender’s public Lightning node. Essentially, wrapped invoices do for lnproxy, what route blinding and payer keys do for BOLT 12.Wrapped invoices are really just “hold” (or “hodl”) invoices – payment requests that require the recipient to perform some action before cashing the payment.Per the lnproxy website, “lnproxy takes a Bolt 11 invoice and generates a ‘wrapped’ invoice that can be settled if and only if the original invoice is settled [first].”CLN still considers BOLT 12 experimental, and not all Lightning implementations have adopted it.“The thing about the way Lightning spec implementation works is that you need two implementations for it to be considered fully ratified,” Sweeney explains.Based on responses in the BOLT 12 Telegram group, several teams like Lightning wallet firm ACINQ, open-source wallet project Lightning Development Kit (LDK), and open-source Lightning implementation project Lightning Network Daemon (LND) are all working on incorporating the specification, but none has fully adopted it.“It's essentially in beta on Core Lightning,” Sweeney says.Lnproxy also seems to be in some sort of beta stage, based on nascency alone, although nothing on its site explicitly mentions that. Nevertheless, it’s not as fully featured as BOLT 12.“The privacy aspect [of BOLT 12] is just one part of it. The other part of it is the ability to pay with a static invoice,” says Henrik Skogstrom, CEO and founder of LN Capital.An alternative to lnproxy in that regard may be something like LNURL which, although comparable to BOLT 12, requires a complex setup.LNURL is an independent project that’s developed a set of tools for enabling communication (over the web) between various Lightning applications.Much like BOLT 12’s offers, LNURL enables withdrawals and reusable QR codes. LNURL can also replace standard username/password login schemes with a unique wallet-generated Bitcoin key, something not currently available via BOLT 12. Conversely, LNURL lacks standard BOLT 12 enhancements like blinded paths and payer keys.But LNURL’s major drawback is that its users must run their own web server. This means setting up things like dedicated machines, software, domain names and web certificates – a process that requires time, money and expertise.As it stands, both lnproxy and LNURL are effective additions to the Lightning “toolbox.” But the general sentiment seems to indicate little need for either, once BOLT 12 is fully adopted.“The lnproxy server can hide your payment from the payer, but the server still knows who you paid and can definitely reveal it later. LNURL provides a nice way to request invoices but requires that you run a web service, which is not a simple thing to do,” Russell explains. “Lnproxy is a wonderful development and so is LNURL. But these are not substitutes for native Lightning privacy.”",2022/12/09
174,"On Wednesday, Apple Inc. made an announcement that might sound minor: It will now offer end-to-end encryption for most material its users backup on its iCloud storage service.That means only a user with an authorized device will be able to access the contents of their cloud storage, in much the same way only the holder of a private key can control a bitcoin wallet. The new feature will protect photos, notes and other files for users who choose to activate it. Email, calendar and contacts material aren’t included, however, because they need to interact with multiple services. In an announcement that also outlines impressive new high-security messaging features, Apple said encrypted iCloud storage will begin rolling out worldwide in early 2023.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.This change is, in fact, a huge deal.Apple emphasizes the benefits of the new system for defending against hackers. But the privacy implications are arguably more profound. Until now, most materials on iCloud could be accessed by Apple under duress, such as when a search warrant or other court order forced them.Apple has tried to stand up to those demands, for instance in its inconclusive 2015 court battle with the FBI. But the new encrypted storage system will render the legal debate moot: law enforcement and intelligence agencies will not be able to subpoena or otherwise compel Apple to hand over user data, because Apple will simply not have the technological ability to comply.That’s why governments and intelligence agencies have reportedly pressured Apple for years not to release the feature. Apple’s defiance of that pressure is admirable, and has potentially immense benefits for public perception of digital privacy.The most influential digital hardware and software maker on the planet, in short, is making a strong stand for the idea that real digital privacy should be allowed to exist. That Apple regards this as important enough that it is pushing back against the U.S. government puts the lie to one of the most shallow and cowardly arguments against privacy: the idea that “if you haven’t done anything wrong, you shouldn’t care about privacy.” Clearly, Tim Cook disagrees.The move towards end-to-end encryption should in turn help normalize online financial privacy, a major agenda item for the cryptocurrency industry. Crypto privacy has been under mounting attack in cases such as the sanctioning of Tornado Cash.The new Apple systems will benefit crypto more directly in two other ways. First, they will have some direct impact on the security of things like crypto keys and wallets. Whether through negligence or truly bad judgment, some crypto users have been known to store their security keys in iCloud backups. That makes them vulnerable to both hackers and, in one notorious instance, the FBI – but with Apple’s new encryption that risk will be massively reduced.The final notable upside for crypto is that Apple’s new system will introduce a huge new user base to security practices and interface features also widespread in crypto. It will be the first time many users are asked to manage their own personal encryption keys, without a centralized recovery process. It’s not dissimilar to how non-custodial crypto apps and protocols require users to keep track of private keys to “be their own bank.”Apple’s software chief Craig Federighi has called this a major responsibility because, much as with blockchain systems, Apple won’t be able to simply reset and send a new password when a user loses theirs. Though technical details are scarce, this is likely impossible to do without effectively giving Apple a backdoor to user files.See also: 4 Reasons Privacy Coins Haven't Taken Off | OpinionTo mitigate this downside, Apple will also introduce a process known as “social recovery” to a mass audience, according to the Washington Post. An encrypted iCloud user can name another person who will have to participate if they ever lose their encryption key. Social recovery or other “multi-signature” backup schemes are becoming more widespread in crypto as a solution to the risk of key loss.We haven’t gotten a look at the interface or workflow yet, but you can bet Apple has designed something elegant and intuitive. Hundreds of thousands of users are about to be introduced to private key management by the most respected name in computing. From there, crypto is just a hop and a skip away.",2022/12/09

176,"Grayscale Investments, manager of the world’s biggest publicly traded bitcoin fund, said a new decentralized finance (DeFi) fund has started trading on over-the-counter markets.The trading debut for the new fund, under the symbol “DEFG,” comes as the shares of Grayscale’s largest fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), are trading a record 47% discount to the value of the underlying cryptocurrency. Grayscale has said it’s operating business as usual, but speculation about the fund’s future has arisen among traders and on Twitter in recent weeks amid swirling questions about the finances of Grayscale’s parent company, Digital Currency Group, after a halt in crypto lending operations at another subsidiary, Genesis Global Capital. (CoinDesk is also a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.)Similar to Grayscale’s other multi-asset investment vehicles, the DeFi fund is designed to give investors exposure to price movements of a basket of digital assets through a single investment vehicle via the stock market instead of buying the cryptocurrencies directly. DEFG tracks the CoinDesk DeFi Index (DFX), which includes the likes of Aave (AAVE), Uniswap (UNI) and Compound (COMP).The components of the fund will be evaluated on a quarterly basis, according to the press release.This is Grayscale’s 15th digital currency investment product to trade on OTC markets, according to the press release.",2022/12/09
177,"Genesis’ extended withdrawal freeze – the lender has told its creditors it will take weeks rather than days to find a solution – continues to weigh on crypto markets, Bernstein said in a research report Thursday.Parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) owes Genesis about $1.7 billion. Bernstein sees three potential approaches for DCG: It could raise capital, sell non-strategic assets and save digital currency asset manager Grayscale or dissolve the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).The “nuclear option,” and the least preferred choice for DCG, would be a dissolution of GBTC, the report said. DCG could apply for Reg M relief and instead of bitcoin (BTC) being sold in the open market upon dissolution, it could be exchanged for GBTC shares. That would leave holders of GBTC with bitcoin instead, causing the least market impact. It's unclear, however, if GBTC holders want to own the bitcoin itself as many bought the fund to avoid the hassles of cryptocurrency custody, the report added.Raising capital may prove difficult as valuations have dropped significantly in the private market since DCG’s last fundraising in November 2021, the note said. And with $2 billion of loans, the company’s balance sheet position is much worse. Therefore, a potential DCG deal structure would be a “comprehensive strategic financing” using a combination of debt to fund the loans, and fresh equity, the note added.Given the size of loans and illiquid assets, it is likely that the state of the balance sheet would weigh on the residual equity value, Bernstein said. This suggests that any deal would require a more strategic partner to be involved.“The feasible deal might be somewhere between a large minority partner or a buyout-like structure into DCG, led by more strategic partners, possibly financial institutions looking to buy entry into the industry,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.As Grayscale is the “crown jewel” and largest revenue generator in the group, the founders could decide to sell non-core assets including CoinDesk, Luno, Foundry or other venture assets, the note said, but it is not clear if this would bridge the balance sheet gap or happen quickly enough.The best option would be for DCG to work toward a comprehensive, strategic financing of the group, and any deal may involve founder Barry Silbert “giving up a large part of the pie,” the note added.Read more: Bernstein Says Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Is Protected From Fallout at Sibling Company Genesis Global",2022/12/09
178,"Crypto mining firm Hive Blockchain (HIVE) will receive less computing power than forecast from its mining rigs using Intel's (INTC) new chips.The 5,800 new machines, dubbed Hive Buzzminers, will have total computing power of more than 630 petahash/second (PH/s), the Vancouver firm said Friday. In October, it estimated a total of 1 exahash/second (EH/s).Hive did not give a reason for the discrepancy, and had not responded to CoinDesk's request for comment by the time of publication. It's possible it changed the specification of the machines to lower power consumption during a period of high electricity costs. It's also possible it ordered fewer machines than anticipated as the price of bitcoin fell more than 60% this year.Some of the machines have already been installed, with the rest expected by the end of January. The rigs' computing power of about 109 terahahes/second (TH/s) per machine is a little over that of Bitmain's Antminer S19 Pro, released in 2020. Hive didn't divulge the energy efficiency or cost of the rigs, key metrics for miners struggling to keep up with high power costs. The Intel chip is touted as environmentally friendly, indicating that efficiency will be its strong suit.Intel's second-generation Blocksale application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for bitcoin mining rigs was announced in April. It is expected to break the Bitmain and MicroBT duopoly in the bitcoin mining ASIC market. Miners can configure the chip into machines of their own design, such as Hive's. That is a marked difference from the Bitmain machines, which are notoriously closed-source. The flexibility, however, comes with the difficulties of deciding on designs and bringing them to production.Argo Blockchain (ARBK), another one of Intel's early clients, decided to redesign the machines, leading to delays in deployment. The London-based company, which is working with ePIC Blockchain on the rigs, said it wanted to reorient the machines more toward power efficiency, bringing them closer to close to Bitmain's Antminer S19 XP with 134 TH/s at 21.5 joules/terahash. Initially, the machines were designed for computing power, Argo said.Griid Infrastructure and Jack Dorsey's company, Block (formerly Square), have been named as other first customers.Read more: Hive to Buy Intel Mining Chip That Can Raise Hashrate by 95%",2022/12/09

The second-largest crypto in market value rose after Ethereum developers determined that the network’s next hard fork, called “Shanghai,” will have a target release time frame of March 2023. The March fork and a second one in the fall will give developers time to focus on technical issues and alleviate stress for individuals who have their ETH (and any accrued rewards) locked in the Beacon Chain staking smart contract.Crypto news has been anything but straightforward this year, though. Earlier in the day, CoinDesk analyst Omkar Godbole wrote that an ETH bear market was likely to intensify after dipping below pivotal support. ETH fell 17% last month, breaching an ascending trend line connecting June and October lows. Later Thursday, CoinDesk also reported that shares of the world’s largest bitcoin fund, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), hit a record-high discount rate of nearly 50% relative to the price of bitcoin.“The fact that Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust is now trading at nearly 50% discount is just awful for holders of GBTC. It really highlights the vast differences in structure quality between different investment vehicles,” Bradley Duke, co-CEO at ETC Group, said in a note to CoinDesk.Grayscale and CoinDesk are both subsidiaries of Digital Currency Group.Most other major cryptos were recently in the green with MATIC, the token of layer 2 platform Polygon, up about 3.3% and popular meme coin DOGE climbing almost 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, jumped more than 2%.Major equity indexes snapped a five-day losing streak with the tech heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 increasing 1.1% and 0.8%, respectively despite recent macroeconomic uncertainties. On Friday, investors will be eyeing the University of Michigan's widely watched consumer sentiment index, which is expected to tick up a few fractions of a percentage point in its preliminary December reading compared to the previous month.IG North America's Kinahan sees cryptos' recent sideways movement as a victory. ""If you get through the end of the year going sideways, I would look at that more as building momentum,"" he said. ""If you're long right now, you're saying to yourself, 'can we just stay in 1% to 3% of the levels we're at right now because that's building a base that will be longer-term confidence.'""Tokocrypto Token Holders See an UpswingBy Glenn ArdiMedia reports from Indonesia say that Binance is in the process of acquiring Tokocrypto, one of the country’s largest crypto exchanges – except this deal hasn’t yet been completed.It's far from official.

According to CoinGecko data, Tokocrypto’s exchange token, TKO, jumped 97% after the first story was published, and is up 50% over the last week.TKO’s trading volume has jumped from around $3 million pre-story to around $67 million as of Dec. 8.Binance acquiring Tokocrypto would make a lot of sense. Indonesia has 16.3 million crypto users registered with its national know-your-customer system, and a population of 280.7 million. As of August 2020, the country reportedly has more crypto investors than stock market traders.Meanwhile, Tokocrypto has had a rough crypto winter. In the past month, the exchange has laid off 20% of its employees and has begun separating out its business units, such as T-Hub (a crypto lounge community in Bali) and TokoMall (a non-fungible token marketplace), into separate entities and will likely spin them off to raise cash.A Binance acquisition would be the perfect opportunity for the struggling exchange.

181,"Chainlink, a provider of price feeds and other data for blockchains, had its first-ever staking pool draw in 24.27 million tokens worth some $170 million, with community allotment filling up in two days.The new staking effort is designed to help secure the quality of the project’s price feed for the cryptocurrency ether (ETH). Under the system, participants and node operators commit their holdings of Chainlink’s LINK tokens as a form of guarantee, in exchange for 4.75% annualized rewards.The Chainlink team tweeted at 1:51 p.m. ET on Thursday that the staking community pool’s limit of 22.5 million total LINK tokens was “100% filled.” While community allotment has been filled, node operators are still able to stake their LINK tokens because the overall staking pool is capped at 25 million LINK. This leaves node operators with roughly 730,000 remaining LINK tokens to stake.General access for the staking program opened earlier in the day, after an early-access period started Tuesday and had seen rapid uptake. At the current price, the staked tokens are worth about $170 million.Staking is a key part of the project’s “Chainlink Economics 2.0” plan, described on its web site as “a new era of sustainable growth, cryptoeconomic security and deeper value capture.”According to a Chainlink blog post, “Stakers will earn rewards for helping secure the Data Feed, specifically by participating in a decentralized altering system that flags if the Data Feed has not met certain performance requirements regarding uptime.”The overwhelming interest in the new staking effort shows that some cryptocurrency investors and users are still eager to sock money into digital-asset projects, even with the nascent markets mired in crypto winter and bellwether bitcoin (BTC) down 64% year to date.For its part, the LINK price is down 65% so far in 2022, including a 10% decline over the past week.There are roughly 508 million LINK in circulation, so the staked LINK represents about 4.8% of the circulating supply.According to the blog post, the next phase of staking is being planned for release in nine to 12 months, after which participants in the initial phase can unlock their staked tokens and rewards.",2022/12/08
182,"Friday’s Commitment of Traders report will show whether recent increased longs are an aberration or sign of increasing confidence.The most recent COT, which measures weekly trading trends among institutional investors, showed such organizations increasing their exposure to bitcoin last week, even as overall markets remained quiet.The current report, reflecting data for the week ending Nov. 29, came as BTC was trading 1.4% higher than the prior week. Following three successive weeks of reduced BTC exposure on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, institutional investors reversed course, adding 147 new long positions. They currently account for 33% of all long open interest on the CME, and are 80% long as a collective.The degree and direction to which these figures change, if at all, will be a key point in tomorrow’s release.Correlation to macroeconomic factorsAs digital asset prices once again appear highly correlated to macroeconomic factors, increased exposure tomorrow would signal that institutions are relatively confident about next week’s interest rate decision, and comfortable with current BTC entry points.Recent macroeconomic data has not surprised markets. Thursday’s 230,000 initial jobless claims aligned with forecasts. Continuing jobless claims of 1.67 million were higher than expectations for 1.6 million. The irony in the data is that higher-than-average continuing claims are likely viewed more favorably, as markets wade through a “bad news is good news” climate.Projections for a 50-basis point increase in the fed funds rate during next week’s meeting fell only slightly to 75%, from 78% following the data release.Long-term investors appear to be taking advantage of BTC now trading at an opportunistic discount.On-chain metrics reflect little conviction, whether bullish or bearish, specific to short-term price movement. At the moment, signs point to an asset with minimal momentum, trading at a compelling valuation.Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, remains below zero, implying that BTC is undervalued. The metric has declined slightly since Dec 6.Moreover, the three-month rolling, annualized basis for BTC remains below zero, reducing the incentive for traders to place market neutral carry trades.When the basis is positive, traders are inclined to simultaneously buy bitcoin in spot markets and sell BTC in futures markets, pocketing the difference in yields. The same holds true for ether (ETH), whose three-month basis has been below zero since Nov 12.Bitcoin’s chart highlights recent price inelasticity. Since Dec. 1, prices have moved a total of .001%.Ultimately, this market favors investors with long-time horizons and significant comfort in BTC’s valuation.Friday’s COT report will provide insight into the degree to which institutional comfort may be shifting.",2022/12/08
183,"U.S. Senators Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) introduced a bill Thursday that would, if passed, direct the Environmental Protection Agency to study the energy usage and environmental impact of crypto mining.Cautioning that crypto mining threatened U.S. energy goals and local power grids, the lawmakers said the Crypto-Asset Environmental Transparency Act would direct the EPA to produce a report examining the effect miners using more than 5 megawatts of power have on greenhouse gas emissions.In a statement, Markey said the mining firms were ""undermining decades of progress in our fight against climate change by putting profits over the promise of our clean energy future.""""Ensuring crypto mining companies report their greenhouse gas emissions is a necessary step toward holding them accountable and protecting communities across the country that rely on the grid to heat their homes, cook their food, and go about their daily lives,"" the statement read.Markey also warned that utility companies may have to raise prices for other consumers, an issue that's led some communities to try and impose restrictions on mining firms in the past.The bill itself refers to concerns about climate change and its growing ecological impacts, including droughts, wildfires and unusual weather events.""Crypto-asset mining operations ... are often designed to generally increase computing requirements over time, which can lead to increased energy consumption,"" the bill said. ""A crypto-asset network, Bitcoin, consumes more energy annually than countries such as Chile or Bangladesh consume.""Noise and water pollution are two other concerns mentioned in the bill. Furthermore, the bill would impose the same energy recommendations on mining facilities already imposed on data centers.The document recommends the EPA propose rules to cover the crypto mining industry to ensure it is bound by greenhouse gas emission reporting and other similar rules, and assess whether any mining facilities are operating without the requisite permits.Merkley pointed to mining facilities being powered by fossil fuels in a statement, saying this practice ""has an environmental impact on climate chaos equivalent to putting 30 million gas-burning cars on the road! And a lot of that fossil electricity is generated at power plants that have a disproportionate impact on disadvantaged and frontline communities, making bad environmental justice issues worse.""His statement also mentioned mining machines being discarded after they burn out and the ""strain on fragile electric grids.""A number of environmental groups have already expressed their support of the bill, according to a press release.",2022/12/08
184,"Shares of the world’s largest bitcoin fund, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), hit a record-high discount rate of nearly 50% relative to the price of bitcoin (BTC) on Thursday.GBTC is a way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin through a traditional investment vehicle. GBTC was trading at a discount rate of 47.3%, according to data from crypto index provider TradeBlock.“The fact that Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust is now trading at nearly 50% discount is just awful for holders of GBTC. It really highlights the vast differences in structure quality between different investment vehicles,” Bradley Duke, co-CEO at ETC Group, said in a note to CoinDesk.Bearish sentiment surrounding the trust deepened over the last few weeks as fears surfaced that crypto trading firm Genesis Global Trading, which is owned by Grayscale’s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), could file for bankruptcy. DCG is also CoinDesk's parent company.Following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, Genesis Global Trading announced on Nov. 16 that it would halt customer withdrawals from its lending unit, Genesis Global Capital. Amid speculation about a possible filing, Genesis said in a note to clients on Wednesday that a resolution of the lending unit’s withdrawal freeze is likely to be a matter of “weeks” rather than days.One line of speculation on Twitter was that a cascade of liquidity issues at DCG subsidiaries might ultimately lead to the liquidation of GBTC, which could lead to a massive amount of dumping of bitcoin on the open market.There were even some complaints that Grayscale hadn'r transparently proven its GBTC fund reserves.GBTC shares haven't traded at a premium to bitcoin since March 2021. Prior to that date, the trust benefited from strong institutional demand and traded at a double-digit premium to its net asset value.On Tuesday, hedge fund Fir Tree said it is suing Grayscale to obtain details about GBTC in order to investigate potential mismanagement and conflicts of interest. The firm said it wants Grayscale to resume redemptions and cut its 2% fees for the trust.",2022/12/08

Russia’s general prosecutor’s office has already requested his extradition to face criminal charges for fraud, according to the report. He had been on the wanted list since Nov. 12, and was apprehended Nov. 30. Earlier in the month, co-founder Zygmunt Zygmuntovich was also arrested in the UAE, and Russia is pursuing his extradition as well, according to RIA Novosti.Finiko was popular in Russia in 2020-2021, marketing itself as a crypto investment fund. The company, which had been conducting public events and openly advertising itself, operated as a multilevel marketing scheme, offering rewards for bringing in new users and targeting mostly women from 30 to 50 years old, according to the Russian investigative outlet The Bell. It could have gotten away with as much as $95 million of investors’ money, The Bell said.In summer 2021, Finiko froze bitcoin withdrawals on its website, allowing users to withdraw only the fund's native token, FNK, which immediately plunged in price by 97%. According to Crystal Blockchain, at the time of the crash Finiko’s crypto wallets contained 1.8 million USDC, 111.3 million USDT and 888 ETH, as well as 110 million FNK tokens.Sabirov's arrest leaves just one of Finiko's known leaders at large, Marat Sabirov, who is not related to Edvard. Kirill Doronin was arrested in Russia in July, despite obtaining Turkish citizenship under the name Onur Namik.Russian serial crypto entrepreneur Sergey Mendeleev told CoinDesk last year that in January 2021, Finiko has been cashing out massive amounts of crypto, sending Moscow's over-the-counter crypto market into a frenzy.",2022/12/08
186,"Presidio Trading, a quantitative hedge fund focused on trading digital assets, plans to separate its crypto tail risk strategy into a standalone fund, the company said.The decision follows the strategy’s strong performance this year, the firm said. In June, the strategy returned about 560% while the overall fund added 4%. Ether (ETH) fell 44% and bitcoin (BTC) dropped 37% in the same period.“Many current and prospective investors in our multi-strategy fund were interested in learning about our tail risk strategy and if we could provide them with access to the strategy through a standalone vehicle,” said Christoper Kvamme, founder and CEO of Presidio Trading.A tail risk is the chance of an investment loss due to the occurrence of a rare event. Tail risk investment strategies look to reduce overall portfolio risk by outperforming during an unexpected downturn, but do so at the cost of lower returns in a bull market.“It's not just other funds and investors who can benefit from protection against nonlinear drops in cryptocurrency markets. I think this new fund will be valuable to the entire crypto ecosystem; exchanges, payment processors, project endowments, and really anyone with significant exposure to crypto,” Kvamme said.The new fund will make some slight changes to the existing tail risk strategy. While the strategy can post positive returns when markets decline, its current design returns losses when digital assets are performing well. The strategy will be tweaked to provide broader protection, most likely by covering a cryptocurrency index, the firm said.The Dallas, Texas-based firm said it is planning to open the fund to accredited investors in the first quarter of 2023, with a limited capacity of $10 million to start.",2022/12/08
187,"It’s no secret that 2022 has been a difficult year for global markets.The U.S. stock market has fallen over 15% in value, bond markets have fallen over 20% and crypto markets have fallen over 50% from their peak in 2021.Early in 2022, central banks around the world began to raise interest rates in order to slow inflation and decrease the rate of economic expansion. The tightening of monetary and fiscal policies has dramatically decreased investors’ appetite for risk and speculative investment strategies. Many investors have opted to sell or exit speculative asset classes altogether. This macroeconomic pressure has affected traditional asset classes and has put tremendous pressure on emerging asset classes including cryptocurrency.The economic situation leading into 2022 allowed crypto to shine. Record low interest rates, an expanding money supply and a strong economy all set the stage for record growth, both in price and adoption, in the crypto economy.You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.Investor interest in crypto was evident as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) both reached all-time highs, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols grew to record size, the crypto market cap topped $3 trillion, the non-fungible token (NFT) market grew exponentially and venture capital firms invested in many crypto businesses.Centralized finance (CeFi) exchanges saw incredible growth as their services offered attractive yields to investors who were not able to find appealing yields in the traditional financial markets. New crypto projects garnered incredible attention and growth, including the Terra ecosystem, headlined by the algorithmic stable coin UST and sister cryptocurrency LUNA.Investor appetite for risk and speculative asset investments was driven by economic policy that many people believed would continue for years to come. Traders, institutional investors and speculators entered leveraged positions, borrowing money at low rates, which added to the frenzy witnessed in the crypto markets.Watch: DeFi vs CeFi: The Search for YieldAs central banks reversed course, began to decrease market liquidity and raise interest rates, these speculative asset classes started to slow. Because of the increase in interest rates, investors saw opportunities to hold lower-risk investments and earn an attractive yield. As the prices of risk assets began to decrease, the crypto market began to sell off. By the end of the second quarter of 2022, the crypto market cap had fallen over $1 trillion. This severe sell-off was accelerated as leveraged positions began to unwind.New and exciting projects like Terra, began to implode as traders exited the crypto markets. The UST stablecoin de-pegged from the U.S. dollar. Investors lost billions of dollars in the UST blow-up, and the overall market went under even more pressure.CeFi intuitions were overleveraged, having lent significant funds to hedge funds such as Three Arrows Capital, which lost a tremendous amount of capital in the sell-off that followed the Terra failure. Three Arrows Capital, along with many other leveraged hedge funds, defaulted on loans owed to many CeFi companies and these CeFi companies were forced to file for bankruptcy protection. User funds held on CeFi platforms were frozen and retail investors were not able to remove their funds. Companies such as Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, which promised attractive yields to users, failed and users lost their funds.Read more: The Fall of Terra: A Timeline of the Meteoric Rise and Crash of UST and LUNABy the end of the summer, crypto markets were showing signs of stabilizing. The leverage in the ecosystem had apparently been purged from the markets and investor confidence began to return to crypto. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) rose to a summer high level of $1,092 on Sept. 12. Confidence was returning to the markets, driven by FTX, a large exchange and custodian, which had stepped in to rescue large CeFi lender BlockFi from bankruptcy. The seemingly strong FTX, led by founder Sam Bankman-Fried, continued to invest in crypto companies, bailed out many distressed startups and was seen as the strongest company in crypto.Confidence in crypto markets continued into the late fall of 2022, until shocking revelations around FTX and sister company Alameda Research came to light in a November CoinDesk article. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao immediately and publicly expressed concerns around FTX's solvency and ability to sustain its self-issued token, FTT. Traders began to withdraw funds from FTX. The FTT price fell from roughly $26 to $1 in just a few days and FTX paused customer withdrawals.The previously healthy company was discovered to be insolvent, having commingled customer deposits and funds. FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in late November. The previous bailout of BlockFi was reversed and BlockFi was back into bankruptcy court. Crypto markets crashed. The CoinDesk Market Index plummeted to a low of $795 as investors continued their exodus from crypto markets.Read more: The Epic Collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX Exchange: A Crypto Markets TimelineIt is important to note that none of the failures we’ve seen this year have been caused by a failure of the underlying blockchain technology. In fact, technical development has continued in the space, and this year has been a monumental time in the history of many blockchains. Ethereum underwent a successful upgrade in 2022, transitioning from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain. The tokenomics of Ethereum have also changed significantly, which many people believe will benefit the future of the Ethereum ecosystem.The failures and bankruptcies seen in 2022 have led many people to call for further regulation in crypto. Fraud, theft, along with irresponsible lending and leveraged trading have created a difficult environment for investors, which many believe would not have been possible with proper government oversight and regulation.As we move into 2023, investors should be aware that the current macro environment, lack of regulation and confidence in crypto, and unclear regulatory frameworks will continue to put pressure on crypto. While these issues are significant and will not be easy to overcome, blockchain innovation and progress is continuing to grow and the use cases for the technology are continuing to be adopted. It is important for all investors to review their crypto portfolios, their investment thesis behind crypto allocations, and set a plan for proper crypto investment moving forward.",2022/12/08

190,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin and other cryptos sink some, but not enough to disturb the calm of the past 10 days.Insights: How will the fallout from FTX affect Sino Global's Liquid Value Fund?Bitcoin Dips, Albeit Not by MuchBy James RubinIn soccer World Cup terms, bitcoin's performance the past 10 days would be the equivalent of a 0-0 draw.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization isn't losing or gaining much ground. On Wednesday, BTC was recently trading at about $16,850. That was down more than 1% over the past 24 hours but didn't offer much variance from its perch since late November when bitcoin established support above $17,000.In an interview with CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" TV program, Joe Orsini, vice president of research at digital asset management platform Eaglebrook Advisors, attributed bitcoin's toughness to an at least temporary slowdown in bad news stemming from the collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX and other crypto fiascos this year.""When it comes to the unexpected, no news is good news,"" Orsini said. ""We've had a few things play out since the FTX news, of course, the BlockFi bankruptcy that was relatively priced in knowing they kind of relied on that FTX-Alameda bailout, as well as now you have concerns with some of the lenders. But it's been slow to play out, and there hasn't been that second wave of shock.""Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,230, off 2.8% from Tuesday, same time. Other major cryptos spent much of the day in the red, albeit not by much, as investors continued to gnaw on recent economic indicators suggesting the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy had not taken as big a bite out of inflation as was hoped. SUSHI, the token of the decentralized exchange SushiSwap was recently off more than 8%, while popular meme coin DOGE fell more than 3.5%.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, tumbled 1.59%.Cryptos roughly tracked U.S. equity markets, which were most down, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropping 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively, amid inflationary fears, although stocks performance improved over the steeper drops of the previous two days. Markets received an extra whiff of encouragement on Wednesday when China announced it was dropping its harshest Covid restrictions. China's measures to limit mortalities from the disease have been slowing the economic growth of the world's second largest economy by GDP.Eaglebrook Advisors' Orsini said that additional contagion could unsettle markets. ""The important thing to consider is if the news does come, and if there is real contagion, does it lead to forced selling or liquidations or stronger selling pressure?"" he asked, although he remained upbeat about a crypto rebound.""Price does have a knack for changing sentiment,"" he said. ""When things are on sale, people want them less. We believe in the long run that these event-driven declines have very little meaning to underlying technology. Bitcoin has specific characteristics that it a really attractive form of money, and potentially to take market share away from fiat. And with Etherium, the ability to automate transactions, and the quality of entrepreneurs entering the ecosystem is not changing.""Orsini added: ""Cycles happen, and so we've been in a bear market for about 13 months, and those (bear markets) were where the opportunities lie for long-term investors.""How will FTX Contagion Affect Sino Global Capital?By Sam ReynoldsConnections between Sino Global Capital’s Liquid Value Fund, its first fund for outside investment, and Sam Bankman-Fried as well as Alameda Research, might mean the venture capital fund is mentioned in FTX’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection proceedings, according to a Hong Kong lawyer who specializes in asset tracing.According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Sino Global’s Liquid Value counts Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda as general partners and co-owners of the fund.In a prior comment to The Block, Matthew Graham, Sino Global’s founder, who has been historically closely aligned with SBF and FTX, said that a “substantial” portion of the Liquid Value fund’s $200 million had been committed by FTX and other partners.According to a recent report by the Financial Times, which detailed all of Alameda’s investments, the Bankman-Fried-affiliated fund put $60 million into Sino Global’s Liquid Value Fund. An unknown amount was then contributed by SBF himself.These events will complicate FTX and Alameda’s process in their bankruptcy hearings, says Stephen Chan, a partner at Hong Kong-based law firm Ince.“If they are in a partnership, all partners share in the upside and the downside,” Chan said in an interview with CoinDesk. “The other partners may incur liability for the actions of SBF and Alameda.”A material amount of Alameda’s balance sheet was made up of FTX’s FTT token, as CoinDesk previously reported, which it used for collateral on investments. If Alameda funded part, or all, of its contribution to Sino Global’s Liquid Value fund via FTT, then this pool of assets – and whatever they were invested in – would be a part of what’s available to creditors.If it turns out that SBF and his cohorts were committing fraud and some of SBF’s partners were in knowing receipt of proceeds of fraud, Chan explained, there would be a slightly different route under Hong Kong common law (the fund is domiciled there, and FTX/Alameda had a significant presence in the territory).“If SBF is a general partner, then the partnership may have liability,” Chan said.In instances of fraud, liquidators working on the FTX-Alameda case may look to recipients of proceeds of fraud to see whether civil recovery is possible.But all of this might be challenging, to say the least. Sino Global is heavily invested in Solana and its respective infrastructure.CoinGecko data shows that Solana has suffered a 93% loss during the last year, and in the weeks following FTX’s collapse nearly $700 million in locked-in value has been wiped out from Solana decentralized finance protocols.The token of Orca, a Solana-based decentralized exchange that is one of Sino Global’s leading portfolio companies, reached a high of $20 in October 2021; it is now worth just over 40 cents. Its total value locked went from $1.4 billion at its height to $43.15 million today, according to DeFiLlama.FTX’s FTT token is currently trading at $1.51, up 14% during the last two weeks, but down 95% on the month. Recently, its contract deployer has dumped the entirety of the locked FTT tokens into circulation, effectively flooding the market with what is already a token of questionable value.8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(00:30 UTC) Australia Trade Balance (MoM/Oct)8:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(12:00 UTC) European Central Bank's President Christine Lagarde Speech9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Initial Jobless ClaimsIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Dips Under $17K; Sam Bankman-Fried Hires Attorney Mark Cohen: ReportFormer FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has hired high-profile defense attorney Mark Cohen, the same attorney who represented Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex-trafficking trial, according to Reuters.

BTC has held comfortably above $17,000 for much of the past nine days, despite ongoing investor jitters about contagion linked to the implosion of crypto exchange FTX and macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly signs since late last week that the U.S. Federal Reserve will have to maintain its hawkish course on interest rate hikes through 2023.SushiSwap (SUSHI): The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol is facing a significant deficit in its treasury that threatens its long-term operational viability, according to a governance proposal from project developers. After reviewing expenditures, the project's annual runway requirement was reduced from $9 million to $5 million, but the treasury still provides for only about 18 months of runway, developers said.Axie Infinity (AXS): The native token of the blockchain-based play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, has come out of oblivion this week with a double-digit price rally. Yet, leverage traders appear skeptical if AXS' turnaround from 17-month lows would be longlasting. That's because while open interest, or the dollar value locked in the number of active standard futures and perpetual futures contracts tied to AXS, has increased to a three-month high of $129.70 million, funding rates remain negative, according to data source Coinglass.By Glenn Williams Jr.Absent a black swan or negative contagion event specific to a centralized entity, digital assets still seem very much connected to macroeconomic developments.But, notably, yields for the federal funds rate, U.S. three-month and two-year Treasurys exceed the yield of 10-year Treasurys.This condition, called an inverted yield curve, has predated past economic recessions. If viewed in isolation, an inverted yield curve does not bode well for bitcoin, or copper prices for that matter.

Absent a black swan or negative contagion event specific to a centralized entity, digital assets still seem very much connected to macroeconomic developments.But, notably, yields for the federal funds rate, U.S. three-month and two-year Treasurys exceed the yield of 10-year Treasurys.This condition, called an inverted yield curve, has predated past economic recessions. If viewed in isolation, an inverted yield curve does not bode well for bitcoin, or copper prices for that matter. Increased short-term rates and slower economic growth lead to lower demand and prices for physical and digital assets.Copper’s individual chart is not nearly as gloomy, however.The metal's price has increased close to 3% over the last month on increasing momentum and steady volume. Its 10-day moving average is north of its 100-day moving average as well, which is a bullish sign.On point two, equities may be trading at an unjustified premium at the moment. A CoinDesk article on Tuesday highlighted how equities trading has been unaligned to fundamental data, decoupling from its normal relationship with the two-year Treasury bond yield.Given the decoupling and the price of copper itself, traders may be expecting a reversion to equities, and may place trades accordingly.Unfortunately, bitcoin traders currently don’t have much cause for optimism about short-term price appreciation.Prices have been noticeably range-bound for the last 30 days, and appear poised to continue that way.Sentiment has followed the same pattern, and the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which has occupied extreme fear and fear territory for months, aligns with September figures.For long-term accumulators of bitcoin, however, this is likely their season. The increased connection to macro factors has provided stable (if not sluggish) price activity for the asset, providing investors with additional opportunities for accumulation.",2022/12/07
193,"CORRECTION (Dec. 7, 2022, 18:52 UTC): Corrects headline to say that Lummis views ether as a security.The U.S. senator behind one of the more important pieces of bipartisan crypto legislation in the works said bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that can be considered a commodity because ether is now a security thanks to September's Ethereum Merge.“It’s starting to look more like bitcoin is the only thing that would qualify as a commodity,” said Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), a longtime bitcoin holder and advocate. She told CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin” program on Tuesday that ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could be deemed a security.“It’s a security because of the way [it] moved from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake,” Lummis said about the blockchain’s upgrade earlier this year. The “inability to [unstake tokens] right now makes it susceptible to being [considered] a security.”Read more: US Sen. Gillibrand Says a Last-Ditch Stablecoin Bill May Still Emerge This YearThat could change, of course, she added. It is possible ether will become “sufficiently decentralized that it could later be deemed a commodity.”A member of the Senate Banking Committee, Lummis, with Sen. Kirsten Gillbrand (D-N.Y.), is a sponsor of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, which was introduced in June. If passed the bill would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) the main power to set regulatory standards for crypto. Lummis told CDTV that among the goals of the bill is clearly defining what can be deemed a security or a commodity.Had the bill already been law, Lummis said, the collapse of crypto exchange FTX might've been avoided.“The type of rehypothecation that was going on with FTX and some of the other attributes of FTX which caused it to fail would have been prevented had the Lummis-Gillibrand bill been in effect,” Lummis said.Lummis said the fall of FTX has only underscored a “more emphatic enthusiasm” to reintroduce the Lummis-Gillibrand legislation in the new Congress next month, and to set clear regulatory standards that will help consumers who take part in the digital asset industry.Read more: Key US Senators Introduce Crypto Bill Outlining Sweeping Plan for Future Rules",2022/12/07
194,"It has now been more than a month since the CoinDesk report that unraveled Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange, what could be one of the largest and most egregious criminal frauds in human history. But we’re still getting a steady stream of horrifying revelations, like desiccated victims being excavated from a serial killer’s basement on live TV. On the brighter side, we also have some fresh insight into the severe consequences Bankman-Fried and his co-conspirators are likely to face.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.There has been huge anxiety, particularly among crypto types, about when and whether Bankman-Fried will be brought to justice. Despite clear signs of fraud, he does not seem to have been detained by law enforcement. He remains in the Bahamas, giving interviews intended to obfuscate his actions and distract from the continuing drumbeat of grisly financial discoveries. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is not alone in regarding this as “baffling.”The most paranoid observers (and the seemingly delusional Bankman-Fried himself) might suspect this to be light treatment, the fruit of his years of currying favor with U.S. leaders. But it’s more likely the delay is just part of the slow-grinding legal process, according to an in-depth new legal report from the excellent MacKenzie Sigalos at CNBC. The U.S. Department of Justice has requested an independent probe of the case, and former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti told CNBC that “it sure looks like there’s a chargeable fraud case here.”And Bankman-Fried’s potential punishment is no small potatoes. He could be sentenced to life in prison, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission trial lawyer Braden Perry told CNBC. That’s according to U.S. sentencing guidelines, and taking into account the number of victims and the size of the apparent fraud at FTX and its closely related trading shop Alameda Research. The CNBC report goes into gratifying detail about exactly what books are likely to be thrown at Bankman-Fried, and how hard.See also: What a Securities Lawyer Would Ask FTX's Bankman-Fried | OpinionThe bad news is that those sentencing guidelines are often “bent” to give softer penalties to white-collar criminals. That’s based on the implicit belief, still widespread in the U.S. court system, that things like financial fraud and embezzlement aren’t “real” crimes. Bankman-Fried’s youth, combined with his ongoing scheme to paint himself as an incompetent buffoon, could also elicit undeserved mercy from a court. It will take real and sustained public and political pressure to make sure that Bankman-Fried gets what’s coming to him.Coming to him it most certainly is – and investigators just keep pulling up bodies. Recent days have seen the emergence of at least two leaks that suggest the fraud was even more depraved than previously understood.Data shared with Bitcoin.com appears to show that Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison had a staggering $1.3 billion deficit on her personal FTX margin trading account as of May 2022. Accounting at both FTX and Alameda was clearly considered a detriment to organizational goals (that is, theft). But taken as read, this deficit would be in addition to the mind-bending losses Alameda proper was allowed to rack up on FTX.These deficits, it must be emphasized, point to fraud at FTX more than malfeasance by Caroline Ellison or Alameda (though there was probably plenty of that, too).It has become increasingly clear that part of Bankman-Fried’s strategy is to throw Ellison under the bus by blaming Alameda for losing funds. This was especially clear in an interview published Tuesday with Frank Chaparro at The Block. But the real crime here was not Alameda being terrible at trading – it was FTX’s failure to enforce fair liquidation rules for Alameda, Ellison and perhaps other allies. In effect, exempting them from margin controls enabled their use of FTX customer funds for speculative activities. Bankman-Fried’s backstabbing of Ellison (reportedly a former romantic partner) should be understood above all as an index of just how little character he has, despite his carefully crafted altruistic persona.And the hits just keep on coming: The Financial Times has received a leaked copy of the investment holdings of FTX Ventures, the exchange’s venture capital (VC) unit. One number is paramount here: The total of investment outflows, tallied by the FT, runs to more than $5.4 billion.Here’s the thing: It seems impossible that FTX could have afforded those investments, along with its other vast expenditures, simply from three years of exchange revenue and its own venture capital inflows of $1.8 billion. Maybe some of the FTX Ventures stakes used fake FTX money like FTT, so there’s more work to be done. But very simple arithmetic strongly suggests not only that FTX was dipping into customer funds, but that the people running FTX could not possibly have been ignorant of that fact.Another detail from those FTX Ventures documents may or may not be criminal, but it is unambiguously disgusting. Among the entities receiving money from FTX Ventures were funds that themselves initially invested in FTX, including Sequoia Capital and Skybridge Capital. Why were they investing in their investors? The Skybridge deal in particular had an air of weirdness even back when it was announced in September. The FTX Ventures funding was earmarked for the Anthony Scaramucci-run venture firm to purchase cryptocurrency.This likely meant buying and custodying crypto through FTX, which has been alleged as a condition of other deals by the exchange. So Skybridge (among others) first gave FTX money to attract more users. FTX then effectively sent those user funds back to Skybridge (and others). That left users with fictitious balances, while Skybridge funneled the cash back to FTX. The technical term for this is “shady as hell.”And now we venture into the real basement. What follows is a hypothetical so shocking, so gory, so foul that only the most steel-stomached financial gorehounds should dare entertain it.See also: Let's Talk About the Bankman-Fried New York Times' 'Puff Piece' | OpinionThe Skybridge announcement doesn’t specify what kind of crypto strategies the fund would pursue with the FTX Ventures money. The most horrifying, human-centipede scenario would be that Skybridge, and/or other funds that got tens of millions from FTX, used some of those rehypothecated FTX user funds to buy the exchange token FTT, which was created by FTX.As I’ve detailed, the role of FTT as collateral in various loans was key to the entire house of cards. Re-re-re-hypothecating user funds by getting outside funds to use them to buy or hold FTT would have opened up further leverage for creative accounting. It’s a possibility that’s beyond grim, and beyond Machiavellian.Maybe that’s all we should ask ourselves to stomach for now. Time to go enjoy some light entertainment, something to distract us from the depths of real-world human depravity. I would suggest a light romp like, say, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""",2022/12/07
195,"Crypto assets should be banned if they are too energy intensive, European Central Bank board member Fabio Panetta said in a Wednesday speech that added to the ECB's previous criticism of private digital currencies.Investors have been caught in the “textbook definition of a bubble,” lured by the promise of ever-rising prices, Panetta said in remarks that echo earlier criticism that the unregulated sector is like a “Ponzi scheme” and a “Wild West.”Though the collapse of crypto exchange FTX has revealed flaws in accounting and risk management, Panetta said crypto would likely “continue to attract investors looking to gamble” – a risky activity he wants to keep sealed off from traditional finance.""It is difficult to see a justification for the existence of unbacked crypto assets in the financial landscape,” he added, saying they are too volatile and inefficient to use for regular payments.The FTX debacle will likely send investors toward decentralized exchanges, he said – adding that those exchanges will be harder to regulate and are liable to amplify financial shocks.“Crypto assets deemed to have an excessive ecological footprint should also be banned,” he said, in a likely reference to platforms like Bitcoin that use an energy-intensive mechanism known as ""proof-of-work"" to validate transactions and secure their network.The ECB's skepticism about crypto is nothing new. Two staffers last week said bitcoin (BTC) is on the “road to irrelevance.” Panetta is considering whether the central bank itself should issue a digital currency, and earlier Wednesday, he set out some of the criteria for apps and wallets using the digital euro.Read more: Bitcoin's Last Stand: ECB Staffers Say the Crypto Is on 'Road to Irrelevance'",2022/12/07
196,"Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, released a new report on Wednesday from global financial audit, tax and advisory firm Mazars showing that Binance's customer bitcoin (BTC) reserves are overcollateralized.""At the time of assessment, Mazars observed Binance controlled in-scope assets in excess of 100% of their total platform liabilities,"" Mazars said in an announcement. The exact percentage was 101%.The collapse of centralized crypto exchange FTX because of liquidity issues has rivals rushing to improve the transparency of their financial reserves. The report from Mazars was meant to assure customers that their bitcoin is collateralized, exist on the blockchain and is in Binance’s control.However, the assessment is not an official audit, according to Francine McKenna, lecturer in financial accounting at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ""They did a comparison of balances per public key address from a list they got from management. They did not compare any balances in independent banks or custodians or depositories,"" said McKenna.""This is more worthless than even the Tether or USDC report,"" she added. In September, Friedman LLP, a New York-based accounting firm that provided auditing services for the stablecoin issuer Tether in 2017 was accused of “serial violations of the federal securities laws” and “improper professional conduct,” by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which fined the auditor $1 million. Tether hired BDO Italia to take over its regular attestation reports in August.Mazars took a snapshot of Binance’s total reserves and liabilities on Nov. 22 to perform a collateralization analysis.

200,"CONCORD, New Hampshire — Federal prosecutors say early bitcoin pioneer and Libertarian activist Ian Freeman and a group of his associates helped scammers and other criminals launder more than $10 million using bitcoin through a network of bitcoin vending machines and in-person and virtual cash-for-bitcoin trades from 2016 until their arrests in 2021.Freeman is standing trial in New Hampshire this week to face federal charges related to tax evasion and the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business.Freeman and a group of his associates – who have collectively been dubbed the “Crypto 6” – were arrested in a raid in March 2021.Four of the Crypto 6, including Freeman’s fellow radio host Aria DiMezzo, his former girlfriend Renee Spinella and her husband Andrew Spinella, and Nobody (formerly Richard Paul) have taken plea deals. Though DiMezzo is not set to be sentenced until later this month, the other three defendants escaped with relatively lenient sentences, avoiding jail time. Another, Colleen Fordham, had all charges against her dropped.But Freeman – the host of the ""Free Talk Live"" radio show and a one-time member of the Libertarian migration movement, the Free State Project – has maintained his innocence and has described the charges against him as politically motivated and the trial as a “sham.”Freeman’s trial comes approximately a year and a half after his residence was raided in the middle of the night by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).In March 2021, gun-wielding agents surrounded the Keene, New Hampshire, home, crashing through a first-floor window with an armored car. They seized property from the residence, including $180,000 in cash, coins and bars made of precious metals, and two physical Casascius bitcoins worth a combined 101 bitcoins. Agents also seized several bitcoin kiosks owned by Freeman from restaurants and other local businesses.During their opening statements on Tuesday, prosecutors told the New Hampshire jury that Freeman was the ringleader of the illegal crypto selling business.They said that Freeman began by installing several bitcoin kiosks (which have been described as distinct from bitcoin ATMs due to their local wallets) throughout the state of New Hampshire, and then eventually branched out into advertising for in-person and virtual cash-for-bitcoins trades on websites like localbitcoins.com.Freeman didn’t ask a lot of questions of his customers, prosecutors told the jury, but charged his customers a premium (usually between 10% and 15%) for their privacy.Assistant U.S. Attorney Georgiana MacDonald described Freeman’s “golden rule” of telling his customers that “what you do with your bitcoin is your business” and not to give him more information.MacDonald said that Freeman’s bank accounts were often shut down, which is why he enlisted the help of his friends and colleagues, whom he asked to help him by opening bank accounts – sometimes in their own names, but also by forming religious entities.Prosecutors say that DiMezzo (who described herself as a “transsexual Satanist anarchist” while running as the Republican candidate for Cheshire County sheriff in 2020) opened an account for the Reformed Satanic Church, and Nobody opened another for the so-called Church of the Invisible Hand.MacDonald described the churches (of which a multitude are involved in Freeman’s operation, including the Shire Free Church, the entity that owns ""Free Talk Radio"") as “little more than letterhead” for Freeman’s operation.Customers of Freeman’s virtual cash-for-bitcoins business (whom prosecutors say include scammers preying on the elderly with romance scams or “Nigerian prince” scams) were allegedly directed to send money to one of the bank accounts associated with the Crypto 6, using descriptions like “purchase of rare coins” or to avoid flagging the attention of the banks.When Freeman’s lawyer, Mark Sisti, addressed the jury during his opening statements on Tuesday, he told them that what they’d heard from MacDonald was “absolute nonsense” and accused the government of intentionally leaving out details that did not benefit their case against Freeman.“Just because it's the federal government, and just because it is an Assistant U.S. Attorney saying it, doesn’t make it true,” Sisti told the jury. “Just because it’s an FBI investigation doesn’t make it credible.”Sisti described Freeman as a gentle, non-violent man who helped victims of scams rather than perpetrating them, and had even helped with crypto-related investigations. The churches implicated in his operation were real institutions, Sisti argued, which had done things like set up an orphanage in Uganda and helped local businesses in New Hampshire set up bitcoin payment systems.Freeman, Sisti said, operated his business in the open and kept records of his transactions (including pictures of his customers’ drivers licenses) on his computer.“Why would you hold onto [licenses and pictures] if you’re scamming? You’d ditch that junk as quick as you could,” Sisti told the jury. “It makes no sense.”Sisti said Freeman often declined to do business with suspicious customers, including an undercover agent who claimed to be a heroin dealer. Sisti said the agent put $20,000 in one of Freeman’s bitcoin kiosks even after Freeman told him he wouldn’t do business with him in person as he’d requested.“[MacDonald] told you he said no before this clown went to a vending machine – without Freeman’s permission by the way – and dumped $20,000,” Sisti said. “What’s he supposed to do, put an armed guard in front of his vending machine?”Sisti also pushed back against MacDonald’s assertions that Freeman ignored “red flags” in his customers and looked the other way when dealing with scammers. He referenced the case of one potential witness, a 76-year-old woman who, over six days, transferred her entire life savings – $755,000 – to a romance scammer who then allegedly traded the cash for bitcoins via Freeman, who charged a 10% fee.What bank did the “little old lady” use, Sisti wondered aloud to the jury, that was “so highly regulated” yet missed the classic red flags of her pulling out enormous sums of money in less than a week?“Show me that bank president,” Sisti said. “Because that guy should be sitting next to me [instead of Freeman].”In addition to the unlicensed money transmitting business charges and two counts of money laundering (one that applies to his entire operation and one for allegedly selling bitcoin to an undercover FBI agent posing as a drug dealer), Freeman also faces four counts of tax evasion.“Ian Freeman just doesn’t like to pay taxes,” MacDonald said.Freeman would probably agree with her statement. Though he’s only being charged for attempting to evade taxes from 2016 to 2019, Freeman told New York Magazine last year that he hasn’t paid federal income tax since 2004.He’s not alone. Libertarians, as a general rule, oppose federal taxes, and the phrase “taxation is theft” has become something of a political meme for many.One trial attendee, who introduced himself pseudonymously as “Bear” (“You know, like the right to bear arms?” he explained), told CoinDesk outside the Concord courthouse that he does not pay federal income taxes and, based on the wording of the U.S. Constitution, does not believe anyone besides government employees are subject to taxes.The question of how to get around taxes is a common one in libertarian circles, and bitcoin – at least in its salad days, before the development of sophisticated blockchain analytics and high-profile arrests of crypto criminals – was touted as a potential solution.Read more: How Tax Protesters Set Off the Bitcoin RevolutionMany major figures in crypto, from ShapeShift founder Erik Voorhees to Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, were inspired by the libertarian use-case for cryptocurrency – but times are changing.As the industry has matured and grown it has attracted the attention of both mainstream investors and regulators, and has subsequently undergone a makeover. “New” crypto is (at least in appearance) regulated and polished, and many industry leaders like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong work hand in glove with the U.S. government.Bitcoin-as-currency is increasingly uncommon, as is intentionally picking fights with regulators, making Freeman and those like him feel like relics of bitcoin’s crypto-anarchist past.Though they have been largely sidelined by the current iteration of the industry, crypto libertarians like Freeman are still active, especially in libertarian strongholds such as Keene, where ""Free Talk Radio"" is headquartered.Many came out to Concord to show support for Freeman on the first day of his trial. Observers in bitcoin T-shirts peppered the courtroom benches, and an overflow room had to be set up for attendees after lunch.“I’ve never seen the courtroom like that,” one security officer told CoinDesk, referencing the number of attendees.Protesters also gathered in front of the courthouse. One man, wearing a custom-made bitcoin mascot costume, told CoinDesk he’d paid a quarter of a bitcoin to have a seamstress make it for the inevitable trial when the Crypto 6 were arrested in 2021. He said he and his husband had made the 29-hour drive from Denver, Colorado, to attend the trial.Freeman’s trial, which began Tuesday, is slated to last approximately three weeks, with both sides listing dozens of potential witnesses.Renee Spinella, Freeman’s former girlfriend and alleged accomplice, is expected to testify against him.Though prosecutors dropped 17 of the initial 25 felony charges against Freeman ahead of the trial, the eight remaining counts carry a weighty 70-year maximum penalty if Freeman is found guilty.",2022/12/07
