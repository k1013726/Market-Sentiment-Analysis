0,"Last week, there was a small uproar in the Web 3 world when a new protocol, DeSo, announced an update to its user login flow. Previously, the decentralized media service had asked users to enter their “seed phrase” into the project’s web interface, defying all generally accepted best security practices and drawing criticism across the industry.“Chrome extensions like MetaMask are more secure, but most mainstream users will never install them. Instead of yelling at our users about security best practices, we did something radical: We met them where they are today,” explained DeSo’s founder, Nader Al-Naji. The team found, however, that they had not actually met users where they were given that “10% of people lost their seed immediately.”Jill Gunter, a CoinDesk columnist, is a venture partner with Slow Ventures, where she invests in early-stage crypto and Web3 projects. She is also a co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system.To address this issue, DeSo now offers users the ability to automatically back up their seed phrases to Google Drive from within the application. If anything, this is even worse from a security perspective than their original login flow.When it comes to seed phrases, the generally accepted best practice is never to store them on any device that is connected to (or has been connected to) the internet. These 12-, 18- or 24-word phrases are what enable users to recover the assets stored in a given digital wallet should they lose or replace the device they used to access their funds. Seed phrases are so sensitive because they allow anybody who knows their magic words to gain access to the associated assets.Read More: DeSo Wants Your Seed Phrase. Let Them Come and Take ItMost crypto and Web 3 applications encourage users to write down their seed phrases and store them somewhere secure, such as a bunker or a physical safe deposit box. Do not tell anyone. Do not store the phrase in an online password manager, the wisdom goes, let alone in your Google Drive. And do not ever enter your seed phrase into a website form, lest you become the victim of a phishing attack.And yet, my experience of interacting with all kinds of crypto and Web 3 users suggests that few take this wisdom on board. It is easy to empathize with DeSo’s predicament.I have fielded many messages from friends who only lightly dabble in crypto asking me for help in remembering “what 12-word sentence” they might have used to back up the bitcoin wallet they set up in 2017. (As a note: unlike a password, users do not decide what their seed phrase should be; it is instead generated for them. Which is yet another point of friction and confusion for users to overcome.)I have seen seed phrases scribbled in notebooks left in backpacks under the counters at bars during crypto conferences. I have acted as customer support on crypto projects and had users message me with their private keys (despite my admonitions not to) asking for help. I have seen users post their private keys in Discord channels. I, myself, only a couple of weeks ago came across 24 words scribbled down on a Post-It note in the bottom of a purse I frequently used a few years ago. I doubt that I will ever know what wallet it is associated with.In light of these observations and experiences, it is tempting to shrug and say that maybe DeSo has it right. For the average user just dabbling in Web 3 for the first time, maybe it is the most sensible approach to store seed phrases somewhere like Google Drive. Better there than in a sock drawer, right?Problem is, even if today the stakes for the average user would be low in keeping their keys in Google Drive, down the line the consequences may become financially significant. It seems that every year, the media becomes fixated on some other poor sap who bought bitcoin in 2011, made hundreds of millions of dollars, but lost their seed phrase and can no longer access the funds (the guy who lost half a billion in a dump in Wales comes to mind).While DeSo users who store their seed phrases in Google Drive will not have to worry about losing track of the seed phrase, they will have to worry about their Google account becoming a target for hackers. If lots of early adopters of the protocol do become millionaires off of the assets they have stored within the DeSo system, then suddenly Google Drive will become an enormous honeypot for all of them. This is dangerous for users – and presumably a situation that DeSo would like to avoid.For the industry, there is an even bigger problem with DeSo’s approach. It is teaching users to do things that are dangerous without adequately explaining to them what the risks are. DeSo is neither educating users nor mitigating the risks they are asking users to take on. DeSo is merely cutting corners and creating problematic habits that users will take with them when they go to use other Web 3 applications.The user experience of accessing and engaging with crypto remains an unsolved problem. Web 3 and crypto almost definitionally ask users to take on more responsibility when engaging with the internet. The responsibilities and challenges arise well beyond the problem of seed phrase storage. Many hardcore crypto proponents advocate for users to run their own nodes for the protocols they interact with. Users regularly have to navigate block explorers to view transaction details, wrap and unwrap assets into different token standards, and, of course, deal with expensive, opaque and unpredictable fees.Much of crypto reverses what Web 2 has trained users to expect and feel comfortable with. With the trusted, free, seamless applications of Web 2, users can port across devices that open and unfold with a mere glance or a buzz on a wristwatch, often without so much as entering a password. That stands in stark contrast to Web 3 and its device-siloed, security-intensive experience that asks users to navigate inscrutable flows, often with little education or instruction embedded in the product.And therein lies a key part of the user experience solution: education. We should not think so little of users that we have to cut corners for them, as DeSo does. After all, a core principle of crypto lies in the empowerment of the individual. Teach users about their options and the associated risks (including, indeed, the options of storing a seed phrase in Google Drive), and let them choose.When I think about the user experience of Web 3 today, I am often brought back to my earliest experiences using a computer and the internet. I recall, as a 5- or 6-year-old, looking on as my uncle set up a Gateway computer for my parents in our family room and hooked us up, for the first time, to dial-up internet. He was using all kinds of jargon that would become native to us all over the next 10 years, but to my parents was clearly foreign and uncomfortable.The “operating system,” the “modem,” the “IP address.” I can still remember the aura of skepticism and exhaustion my parents seemed to share once my uncle had left that afternoon. As if they were thinking: “There’s no way we are ever going to figure out how to use this.”Read more: DeSo Launches $50M Fund for Decentralized Social EcosystemBut we all figured it out! The average computer user may not be able to give you the precise, technically accurate explanation of the role an operating system plays on their computer, or why a modem is needed or how an IP address is derived. But billions of us have figured out how to upgrade an operating system, plug in a modem and connect to Wi-Fi networks. Some of this has come down to innovation in user experience, but much of it has simply resulted from user education combined, importantly, with strong incentives for users to get up to speed. Once I caught a glimpse of what that old desktop computer connected to the internet could offer me, I made it my business to understand what I needed to be able to use it. Neopets and America Online were enough to motivate me to figure it out in all of its complexity.The same is, and will continue to be, true of crypto and Web 3. With a strong enough value proposition, concerns about users balking and churning at the prospect of downloading a Chrome plugin or having to securely store a 12-word phrase will diminish for product builders. That is not to say that we should not still work to improve these experiences. It is only to say that we should not assume that we have to go to the extreme measures of cutting corners to onboard users. We ought to give them more credit than that. And if cutting corners is what it takes to users to pick up your product, then perhaps you should re-examine whether your product is actually providing sufficient value.",2022/01/19
1,"Crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments wants to become the sponsor and manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the company said in a blog post this week.Valkyrie, one of Grayscale’s rivals, previously launched a bitcoin trust and a bitcoin-related exchange-traded-fund (ETF) in 2021. As part of their plan to sponsor GBTC, the world’s largest bitcoin fund, the Tennessee-based company also announced the launch of a new fund, the Valkyrie Opportunistic Fund, LP that seeks to take advantage of GBTC’s discount to the value of its underlying bitcoin, the company said.Valkyrie’s plan would be a tall order, considering that GBTC alone has over $10 billion in assets and Valkyrie only handles roughly $180 million in total assets.“We understand that Grayscale has played an important role in the development and growth of the bitcoin ecosystem with the launch of GBTC, and we respect the team and the work that they have done,” Valkyrie said. “However, in light of recent events involving Grayscale and its family of affiliated companies, it is time for a change.”Grayscale and CoinDesk are both owned by the Digital Currency Group.In its proposal, Valkyrie said it wants to facilitate GBTC redemptions at net asset value (NAV) for investors through a Regulation M filing. It also proposes to lower the fees to 75 basis points as opposed to the current 200 basis points, and to offer redemptions in both bitcoin and cash.Earlier this month, GBTC shares hit a record-high discount rate of over 50% relative to the price of bitcoin (BTC). GBTC’s recent struggles were triggered by the Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) reiteration of its reasons for denying Grayscale Investment’s application to convert GBTC into a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale called the initial denial “arbitrary, capricious and discriminatory.”Grayscale did not immediately return a request for comment.",2022/12/30
2,"The mining industry started 2022 off strong with what seemed like ample capital to expand, but high energy prices, increasing competition for Bitcoin blocks and a bear market hit miners, knocking out those with high leverage.The sector was shaken by bankruptcies and loan defaults, and next year will likely bring even more pain, as miners struggle to bolster their balance sheets and operations. But it will also present an opportunity for those in a position to buy assets, as well as for those that can improve their margins with new innovations.CoinDesk spoke to some of the top executives and analysts in bitcoin mining to review past year and predict trends for 2023. Here’s what they said.Industry participants say that lots of money was spent over the last year to boost hashrate, a measure of computing power on the Bitcoin network, but that in many cases, those investments didn’t pay off, as companies loaded up on debt to finance the growth only to see the economics of crypto mining break down.""Many miners acted too deterministically,"" projecting bitcoin (BTC) would hit $100,000 and not even considering that the price would drop below $20,000, said Juri Bulovic, head of mining at crypto mining and staking firm Foundry, which is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group.With falling bitcoin prices, many companies had trouble meeting their debt obligations.Read more: Bitcoin Miners’ FTX Contagion Exposure May Amplify Industry Pain""There aren’t many ways to financially materialize those plans. One either sells bitcoin, borrows debts or issues equity. When selling mined bitcoin was barely enough to cover OpEx (operating expenses), many opted for debt financing as the equity market turned cold,"" said Wolfie Zhao, head of research at TheMinerMag, the data and research arm of mining consultancy BlocksBridge.Read more: Crypto Miners Face Margin Calls, Defaults as Debt Comes Due in Bear MarketOn the flip slide, lenders were too optimistic.""Many had not been able to properly assess the risks associated with such mining rigs-backed loans given that this is the first cycle in which such loans were given out,"" Bulovic noted.Some miners saw their debt-to-equity ratio, a measure that shows a company’s financial leverage, more than triple in the third quarter, according to TheMinerMag data.Unsurprisingly, miners that had high debt-to-equity ratios, like Core Scientific (CORZ), Greenidge Generation (GREE) and Stronghold Digital Mining have had to either file for bankruptcy or restructure their debt obligations.Many miners also failed to hedge their risks against a falling bitcoin price.“Bitcoin miners have much to learn from traditional commodity-producing industries like oil and gas. Instead of using financial instruments to increase their long oil exposure, oil producers hedge their exposure by selling oil futures. Hopefully, this bear market will inspire miners to decrease their bitcoin price risk through more sophisticated risk management,” Jaran Mellerud, an analyst at Luxor Technologies, a provider of bitcoin-mining services, said. Luxor opened a derivatives desk to sell hedging products to miners in October, although the idea of hedging with derivatives had already started to sow its seeds within the miners as the broader market crumbled.""I really think investors want two things – they want transparency and they want predictability – and that's what hedging brings to a miner,"" said Chris Bae, founder and CEO of digital-asset trading firm Enhanced Digital Group. Bae’s firm provides hedging products to miners that are trying to implement risk-management strategies. Other companies such as crypto-focused financial-services firm Galaxy Digital and Singapore-based digital-asset management platform Metalpha are also providing hedging services to miners.TheMinerMag’s Zhao pointed out that it wasn’t only overleverage that has brought some miners to their knees, but also lack of treasury management.""If Core had been selling half of its mined bitcoin every month and holding the rest since January 2021, it likely won't be so troubled as it is now while still having a few K [thousands] of BTC on its balance sheet to capture the long-term upside,"" he said, referring to Core Scientific, a miner that filed for bankruptcy in December.Instead, the world’s largest miner by hashrate waited ""until May when the market pain started to really kick in"" to start selling its accumulated digital assets, Zhao said.Miners that had a high proportion of debt relative to their bitcoin production have found themselves under water.“Five of the six companies with the largest net debts per BTC mined have had some level of restructure since the second half of this year, with the exception of Marathon Digital Holdings,” Zhao said.The analyst thinks that Marathon has bucked the trend in part because the mining firm raised $750 million last year in unsecured convertible notes with a 1% coupon rate. Core Scientific, by contrast, raised $500 million in secured convertible notes with a 10% rate.Marathon is also working to reduce its debt obligations, the firm told CoinDesk.Still, Jaime Leverton, CEO of Canadian miner Hut 8 (HUT), predicts the worst is yet to come in terms of capitulation and bankruptcies, particularly in the first half of 2023, and she’s not sure that relief will come in the second half.Luxor’s Vera said he expects many companies to be taken private, saying companies can gain efficiencies by hosting and running machines.But Fiorenzo Manganiello, founder of Cowa, a mining and venture-funding firm, said buyers may be better off just purchasing bitcoin rather than dealing with hassles of owning and operating machines.For the rest of the pack, the year looks like a year of survival and recovery.“Unless we see a full-scale bull market, which I doubt we will, miners will use 2023 to strengthen their balance sheets and improve their operating efficiencies. The year’s biggest trends will be cost minimization and debt reduction,” Mellerud said.Read more: Bitcoin Miners’ FTX Contagion Exposure May Amplify Industry PainIn 2023, miners will not only have to find the best energy deals, but get creative about how they can lower their costs or bring in revenue by tweaking their power consumption and supply, industry experts say.As margins continue to compress, miners will have to look at how they can participate in “demand response programs,” meaning selling power back to the grid in times of high demand, as well as recapturing heat from mining rigs and using stranded energy, Bulovic said. “Miners who have a real grasp on the processes, policies, regulations and technical know-how of these adjacent industries will gain an edge over the other miners,” he said.Read more: Bitcoin Miners Powered Off as Winter Storm Battered North AmericaCrypto mining is becoming a bigger part of the energy industry, and by the end of 2023, more companies will need to be vertically integrated, with their own power source in order “to maintain long-term stable operation, as the halving is just getting closer,” according to Daniel Jogg, CEO of Enerhash, a Hungary-based company that runs blockchain data centers. Halving is when the number of bitcoin mined per block drops by 50%.Another lesson related to the importance of managing power costs is on hosting, the business model in which firms bring in revenue for owning and operating the infrastructure. “High energy prices and low bitcoin prices have been particularly hard on this model,” Zach Bradford, CEO of crypto miner CleanSpark (CLSK) said.Compute North, the first big firm in the industry to go bankrupt, was primarily a hosting firm. Core Scientific was also losing money in its hosting business – about $10 million in the third quarter.Read more: ​​Core Scientific Again Raises Bitcoin Mining Hosting RatesMining firms like Digihost Technology (DGHI), Greenidge Generation and Argo Blockchain (ARBK) that relied on natural gas or the electricity grid for their power, saw their costs skyrocket in the third quarter, according to the data from TheMinerMag.The trend of cost per bitcoin produced over the year “looks very similar to the U.S average household energy price increase this year. The average of all the major mining companies' cost of production per BTC mined has gone up by 7% in Q3 compared to Q1,” Zhao said.As miners try to become more efficient and bring down power costs, they might end up taking a counterintuitive path – underclocking mining machines. That’s the practice of “reducing energy consumption and total hashrate to improve energy efficiency,” which is “one of the best and most readily available technologies” to improve efficiencies and control costs, Ben Gagnon, chief mining officer at Canadian miner Bitfarms (BITF), said.Nascent technologies like immersion and hydro cooling are also becoming more popular, but it is uncertain whether miners will deploy them at scale in the future because of cost concerns.Immersion cooling entails submerging mining machines in a tank of fluid, whereas hydro cooling entails a new generation of mining rig, which are heavily promoted by Bitmain, the world’s largest mining machine equipment manufacturer. Hydro machines have tubes placed close to the chips. Fluids go through these tubes, taking heat out of the machine. These rigs require a special infrastructure to run, and often to treat the water such that it doesn’t degrade the tubes over time.Read more: Amid Market Rout, Crypto Miners Are Still Building“Even though the current mining economics has disincentivized miners from experimenting with these new technologies, we do expect to still see progress being made in 2023 to advance the technology and lower costs,” Foundry’s Bulovic said.Aydin Kilic, president and chief operating officer at Canadian crypto miner Hive Blockchain (HIVE), touted the Hive Buzzminers, a new mining rig built using Intel’s (INTC) highly anticipated Blocksale chip. These mining machines will be the first ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miner deployed by any of the major public crypto mining companies and designed in-house, he said.The past year started with a noticeable centralization of the bitcoin mining hashrate in the U.S. In January, the U.S. accounted for about 38% of computing power on the Bitcoin blockchain, and Canada almost 7%, according to the Centre for Alternative Finance at the University of Cambridge. Next year, that trend might be broken. Luxor’s Mellerud and Chief Operating Officer Ethan Vera both expect miners to migrate to South America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia because those regions have cheaper electricity.Hut 8’s Leverton said that this decentralization is her “hope,” given that bitcoin is supposed to be a distributed network, not aggregated in one particular jurisdiction, although she noted that political instability could be an obstacle in some countries.Read more: Bitcoin Miners’ High Hopes for Latin America Dented by Paraguay Many places are concerned about bitcoin mining’s energy use and its impact on local communities, and in 2022, they started setting limits.In the past year, New York state enacted a two-year moratorium on new bitcoin mining operations, lawmakers in the U.S. are targeting the industry’s energy use, utilities in three Canadian provinces have stopped approving new bitcoin mining connections to the grid, and a bill is under consideration in Kazakhstan that will cap the energy available to miners.Industry experts said they don’t expect any regulation on the federal level in the U.S. or Canada in the coming year, but local or state governments might continue to place restrictions on the industry.Gagnon of Bitfarms sees this small-scale regulation as an important testing ground for any federal laws to come in the years ahead.Vera, however, cautioned that the moratorium set by New York state “sets a challenging precedent” for the rest of the U.S. for expansion of new mining farms. New site developments across states controlled by Democrats are likely to be targeted by regulation, he said.Mellerud said that in Europe, the European Union regulators will be “more aggressive toward bitcoin miners in 2023.”As the continent “struggles with its energy crisis, energy-intensive industries like bitcoin miners become natural scapegoats that regulators could target to score some cheap political point,” he said.Read more: Europe’s Last Bitcoin Mining Refuge Is No Longer Viable",2022/12/30
3,"Investment giant BlackRock (BLK) has committed $17 million to bankrupt bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ) as part of a new $75 million loan from the miner's secured convertible note holders, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that was filed on Thursday.BlackRock, which is Core Scientific's largest shareholder according to FactSet data, already held $37.9 million in secured convertible notes as of Wednesday. The latest $17 million is part of the new $75 million convertibles notes, which are part of Core's prearranged bankruptcy process, the filing says. In a prearranged bankruptcy, the debtor reaches some sort of agreement with its creditors before officially filing for bankruptcy.Core Scientific, the largest miner by computing power, filed for Chapter 11 on Dec. 21. The move comes as miners in general have been squeezed by high energy costs and low bitcoin (BTC) prices. Core noted that it expects support from some of its convertible noteholders in the form of two debtor-in-possession (DIP) facilities, totaling up to $75 million.According to the restructuring plan, the secured debt convertible noteholders will get equity. The current equity and unsecured holders will get warrants so that as the company grows, they will get more shares, its chief mining officer, Russell Cann, told CoinDesk.Read more: Inside Core Scientific’s Prearranged BankruptcyOut of the total $75 million, the lenders have already committed $57 million, including BlackRock's new loan, to the miner. The DIP facility has a maturity date of June 21, 2023 with terms to extend to Sept. 21, according to the new filing.Shares of Core Scientific traded at 8 cents on Friday afternoon.Core first warned of the risk of bankruptcy in late October and said it wouldn't be paying some of its loan installments, sending its shares plummeting about 80% on Nasdaq. In November, it reiterated that it may run out of money by the end of this year. Compute North, another major firm in the mining business, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September. Crypto miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK) narrowly avoided bankruptcy after getting a $100 million bailout from Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital this week.BlackRock, Vanguard and Fidelity are among few of the TradFi giants that invested in bitcoin miners during the bull run as shares of publicly traded miners offered a faster way to get exposure to the sector, without having to buy bitcoin directly in the face of uncertain regulations.Read more: Crypto Miners Face Margin Calls, Defaults as Debt Comes Due in Bear Market",2022/12/30
4,"For many people, myself included, who were drawn to cryptocurrencies by the prospect of fixing or replacing an exclusionary, extractive, outdated global financial system, the failure in crypto markets this past year has delivered an extremely cold bath.Now, to be clear, most of the massive financial hit to investors was not due to a failure of technology.For the Bitcoin blockchain, for example, none of the drama of the past year matters. Every 10 minutes, day in, day out, it adds a block of transactions to its ever-growing ledger. It’s a reminder that the global, decentralized networks of computers running Bitcoin, Ethereum and other permissionless blockchain’s protocols continue to forge systems for intermediary-free value exchange with which no one person or entity can interfere, regardless of the ups and downs of markets. The presence and persistence of these vast autonomous machines continue to leave me awestruck.You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.But “crypto” is more than protocols, smart contracts and cryptography. It’s also the community of humans who have gathered around this amalgam of technologies. Without this community, the technology can’t enter real-world adoption and foster change for good. And unfortunately, the failures in 2022 were due to their actions. While a few people in particular are rightly lumped with the bulk of the blame, there is mass collective responsibility here. The theft, deception and staggering breach of trust happened on our watch.If we are to take lessons from the wealth destruction of 2022, the conclusion cannot be that this is all the fault of Sam Bankman-Fried and his ilk. SBF deserves the prison time he seems sure to receive with his extradition to the U.S., but the real question is how do we create a system – not merely a technological system but one of laws and standards – that makes it much harder for people like him to do what they did.There is much work to do to build that system in 2023 and beyond. But it starts with the lessons of 2022. There are many. Here are the five that I think are the most important:With all the headlines generated by the collapse of FTX in November, it’s easy to forget that far bigger losses hit cryptocurrency markets in the first months of the year – not because of a crypto-endemic scandal but because the Federal Reserve was hiking interest rates. That put an end to the surfeit of dollars pouring into speculative assets around the world, including cryptocurrencies. The macro environment matters.The domino effect, seen when the failure of one crypto institution quickly spreads to another, is hardly without precedent. It was there in the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 1998 Long-Term Capital Management collapse, the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis and many other such moments in financial history. They all had the same characteristics: an overly bullish belief in the upward momentum of financial assets fueled an excessive buildup of loans to speculators. When those beliefs proved unfounded, the rush to the exits exposed an interdependent network of creditors and debtors as they dragged each other down in unison. Crypto speculation was never going to be immune from this, regardless of the decentralized nature of the underlying protocols.Most of the high-profile collapses in 2022 – FTX, Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital, Genesis – involved custody-holding CeFi (centralized finance) companies that put customer funds at risk. That has galvanized supporters of DeFi (decentralized finance), who rightly note that the most robust decentralized market-making and exchange systems survived, precisely because they lack a trusted intermediary capable of such abuse. (Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also CoinDesk's parent company.)Yet as of October, Chainalysis estimated that DeFi investors had lost a record $3 billion year to date because of smart contract breaches, “rug pulls” by founders, and because the underlying tokenomics of some protocols were deeply flawed. (The destructive collapse in the Terra ecosystem was exemplary of the latter instance.) DeFi is a wild, volatile, confusing, unpredictable place. To achieve widespread participation, it needs a more comprehensive audit model in which trustworthy independent analysts or bounty-hunting developers assess projects’ code security, founder practices and tokenomics.In 2020 and 2021, when social media-driven meme coins were turning kids into instant millionaires, when DeFi projects were paying yields unavailable anywhere else in the world and when institutional and retail investment sent crypto’s market capitalization up 15-fold to almost reach $3 trillion, we should all have been asking tougher questions. The most important one should have been: what’s underpinning all this?If we peel back the layers of interlocking protocols and the justifications for the returns they were promising, we’re left with little more than speculation for speculation’s sake. Most of that was built on momentum trading, on “numbers-go-up” expectations. It’s time to get back to basics and seek out real-world utility. Token returns need to point back to actual value cases, whether its cross-border payments, decentralized energy, new marketing models offered by non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or one of many other promising use cases.Sure, this one’s self-interested, but 2022 proved it to be undeniably true that this industry needs a robust “Fourth Estate” to hold accountable the people and entities working within it. Permissionless blockchains should be viewed as public goods – much as the air we breathe, the water we drink or the highways we drive on are public goods. They must be protected as such, which means there must be transparency (balanced with a respect for individual privacy). And while we are all enormously proud of the catalytic role CoinDesk played in exposing the FTX house of cards, it raises the question of why this wasn’t caught earlier. Answer: There aren’t enough crypto-savvy, professionally managed, independence-protected journalists covering this market. (That’s why we got those naive softball articles from the New York Times and others that glossed over SBF’s fraudulent behavior and got my colleague David Morris fired up.)Still, here’s a hill I will die on: The requisite transparency isn't something that can be achieved solely through the work of “citizen journalists” on Twitter or elsewhere. Those who claim the FTX debacle was brought to the fore by crowd-sourcing the sleuthing work of ordinary people on social media ignore the fact that the meltdown was triggered by an investigative article by Ian Allison, a trained journalist working within the structure of a professionally run newsroom, with editors and management who have carved out a position of independence from their proprietor to earn the trust of their readers. (CoinDesk is a subsidiary of DCG but operates independently and abides by a core code of ethics.) Before Ian’s piece, where was all that Twitter wisdom-of-the-crowd discovery?If this industry is to thrive it can’t again be blindsided by revelations of wrongdoing as extreme as those uncovered in 2022. That requires vigilance to transparency and recognition that journalists who dig into issues at relevant institutions are doing a service to the longer-term interests of this industry rather than undermining it.",2022/12/30

6,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Three days before the close of 2022, bitcoin inched proudly upward. Solana continued to tailspin before erasing losses late in the day, while other cryptos were mixed.Insights: Mark Connors, head of research for digital asset manager 3iQ, sees a crypto rebound by the third quarter of 2023 and financial services firms and others playing a more proactive role in the development of regulation.Bitcoin Remains Defiant at the Close of a Dreadful YearBy James RubinOn the third to last day of a historically, massively, tragically bad year, bitcoin held its head proudly if barely above water.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just above $16,630, up a few fractions of a percentage point over the past 24 hours. BTC has now been balancing roughly between $16,400 and $17,000 for 13 days amid investor sluggishness typical for a year's closing days. Crypto markets would also rather forget acquaintances – auld and new – to 2022 even as they gird for more rough times ahead in 2023.""Bitcoin continues to happily tread water and watch the storm pass as it fluctuates in a range of around $16,000-$17,000,"" wrote Craig Erlam, senior markets editor for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, in an email. ""That's broadly been the case over the last couple of weeks and it doesn't look like changing in the coming days, barring any unexpected headlines.""Erlam added: ""The question for many now is whether it has bottomed and how long it will take confidence to return, enabling a strong recovery. I'm not convinced by either in the near term and think there are plenty more twists and turns to come early next year.""Ether was recently changing hands slightly below $1,200 but up 0.8% from Wednesday, same time. Other major cryptos were mixed with ETC, the token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain project, rising about 4% and popular meme coin SHIB up nearly 3%, but SOL's sad saga continuing, with the token of the embattled Solana blockchain, plummeting more than 12% at one point. SOL erased those losses after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik tweeted his support for the platform, but has dropped almost 20% over the past week from over $12 to nearly $9.70, and is off more than 90% since Jan. 1. SOL's decline has largely stemmed from Solana's ties to the collapses of the Terra ecosystem and crypto exchange FTX.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently jumped 0.21%.Equity indexes closed 2022's penultimate trading day on a high with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 climbing 2.6% and 1.7%, respectively.

In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program on Thursday, Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at crypto sleuthing firm TRM Labs, said that cracking down on crypto hacks will require hardening cyber defenses.

""Look at some of the darlings that people were really excited about 18 months ago in stocks, they’ve lost 80-90% of their value as well.”Fund Manager 3iQ Has 3 Bold Predictions for 2023By James RubinA year ago, before the crumbling of the Terra ecosystem, the implosion of Three Arrows Capital and crypto lending platform Celsius and disgrace of exchange giant FTX, who could have foreseen that the digital asset industry would be limping home in 2022. A year ago, bitcoin was still percolating over $47,000 and seemed likely to remain unruffled by the economic headwinds already buffeting the world.What's in store in 2023?In an interview with CoinDesk, Mark Connors, head of research for Canadian crypto asset manager, said he expects a price rebound in 2023 and TradFi companies and others to play a more active role not only in finding uses for blockchain technology but in the development of regulation. ""Leadership will come from the corporate side, not the regulatory side,"" Connors said.CoinDesk: What's your first prediction for 2023?Connors: Leadership will come from the corporate side, not the regulatory side. We're looking for regulatory clarity so that investment firms can own coins and invest in existing Layer 1s. Whether whether it be bitcoin, Ethereum or Layer 1s, we believe the incentive structures of companies will make them take a leadership role and act and not wait for legislation to both continue to create their own industry blockchains as well as leverage the existing Ethereum EVM, and to a lesser degree, the bitcoin blockchain as they transfer both B2B and B2C functionality to blockchains. That was the most silent, underreported action in 2022. TradFi is going to lead the charge, not native crypto and not regulatory agencies. That's going to be the curveball.CoinDesk: What else do you foresee for the year ahead?Connors: 2023 will be a barbell for digital assets. It will be the core Layer 1s, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and it will be the use of NFTs by TradFi companies, which is a corollary to my first point. In 2022, the ecosystem was you had your alt level ones like Solana, Algorand and the like providing the bulk of the non-Bitcoin, Etherium, stablecoin market cap. Seventy percent of market cap in digital assets of the last 12 months. So that 30% of market cap is going to shift from alt level ones and level twos and other projects to be more NFT related. The NFT technology from a security and verification standpoint has greater integrity, and a higher trust and security factor. Given it can be nested with the Etherium ecosystem and can be bridged, it will have functionality and security. I think you'll see the most growth in NFTs.CoinDesk: What's going to happen to crypto prices? Do you see a rebound, and if so, when?Connors: We are so dollar based. Dollar strength destroys risk assets. The Fed has two mandates, price stability and full employment. But they have taken on a third mandate. They have a trilemma, which is wonderful because no economic system can run on two poles. My third prediction is that before the third quarter, the Fed will stop quantitative tightening. They will stop because the Treasury market would have experienced a failure like September 2019. Money markets will crack, the Fed will print and crypto will reverse as sharply as it did in March 2020. We're still young as a market.

7,"Although the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, bitcoin (BTC), saw a roughly 64% decline in value year-to-date, CoinDesk research shows that bitcoin and ether returns in 2022 per unit of risk were about the same as equities and significantly better than bonds.“We want to underscore this is not too different from what you would see in traditional markets, especially stock markets,” said Andrew Baehr, CoinDesk Indices managing director, on First Mover CoinDeskTV.“Look at some of the darlings that people were really excited about 18 months ago in stocks, they’ve lost 80-90% of their value as well.”Bitcoin and ether appeared to be affected by the same forces that made stock investing a challenge over the past year, including high inflation and the looming threat of recession. According to CoinDesk data, stocks were nearly twice as risky in 2022 as 2021.When looking at what caused this, Baehr said in a research report, that liquidity has to be the number one candidate. “When you look back at the negative events in the cryptocurrency industry it’s not too hard to draw an arrow to quickly deteriorating liquidity conditions as a partial cause,” said Baehr.",2022/12/29
8,"Blockchain project Stacks has published a whitepaper showing how a new digital asset called “Stacks bitcoin” (sBTC) can be used to make Bitcoin fully programmable.Unlike Ethereum or Solana where developers can conjure up all manner of algorithmic machinations – think six-figure gorilla avatars – Bitcoin’s simpler scripting language limits what Bitcoin developers can create on the platform.Stacks, an existing smart contract platform, wants to break through those limitations by introducing a new digital asset derived from bitcoin – sBTC (pegged at 1:1 with bitcoin) – that can be used to create smart contracts on Stacks, but can also be readily converted back to bitcoin (BTC).“Bitcoin is, by design, relatively slow and does not natively provide the fully-expressive smartcontracts needed to build sophisticated applications,” the whitepaper states. “Faster and more sophisticated applications must therefore be built outside of the base layer. Bitcoin layers enable this.”Read more: Smart Contract Platforms: Past, Present and FutureThe term “layers” is Stacks’ lingo for any system outside of Bitcoin’s base layer, such as a sidechain, which is a secondary blockchain that interacts with a primary blockchain. In the whitepaper, Stacks acts as a Bitcoin sidechain, powered by both sBTC and STX – Stacks’ native token.The project claims in its white paper that its Bitcoin sidechain can unlock “hundreds of billions of dollars” in DeFi on Bitcoin.The concept is still in the implementation phase and will be formalized under Stacks Improvement Proposal (SIP) 21, according to Stacks co-founder, Muneeb Ali.“The vote went through and implementation has started,” Ali confirmed during an interview with CoinDesk.”This is going to be the next major release. My best guess is maybe eight to nine months from now.”The current Stacks protocol uses a consensus mechanism (how computers agree on the state of a network) called “proof of transfer,” where anyone can be a miner or “stacker.”Miners earn STX rewards for mining Stacks blocks, but must first post bitcoin to earn mining privileges. That bitcoin is subsequently distributed as a reward to stackers who maintain a copy of the Stacks ledger; stackers must also lock up STX for a certain length of time to receive stacking privileges.In the proposed sBTC peg system, users send regular bitcoin to a wallet controlled by stackers (a process referred to as “pegging in”). This action mints an equivalent number of sBTC that can be used in smart contracts on Stacks.To get their bitcoin back (“pegging out”), users return sBTC to the wallet. Stackers then sign these peg out requests and release the equivalent amount of bitcoin back to the users. This also prompts the Stacks protocol to burn the corresponding sBTC.“It's a fully trustless system. It's a protocol,” says Ali. “There is a dynamic set of signers who have economic incentives to be signers and they sign the peg transactions.”Bitcoin sidechains aren’t new. Blockstream, a Bitcoin infrastructure firm, published a whitepaper on sidechains as early as 2014, and currently has a fully functional sidechain federation called Liquid.Earlier this month, Layer 2 Labs raised a $3 million seed round from angel investors to develop “drivechains,” another flavor of Bitcoin sidechains.Read more: Bitcoin Development Company Layer 2 Labs Raises $3M to Bring Drivechains to NetworkIn addition, Bitcoin developer Ruben Somsen has been working on “spacechains,” which he describes as “one-way pegged sidechains for Bitcoin.”So what new innovation does sBTC bring to the sidechains conversation? Ali claims the sBTC model is unique in that anyone can be a miner or stacker. He sees the use of STX to incentivize stackers to sign peg out requests as a distinct advantage, although alternative projects tend to avoid the use of altcoins such as STX like the plague.“It's a trade off,” Ali explains. “The trade off you're making with Liquid is that users need to trust Blockstream and friends – the federation. On Stacks, because there is the extra [STX] token, there is no company in the middle. So you can pick one; you can't have both.”",2022/12/29
9,"Cracking down on crypto hacks will require hardening cyber defenses, Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at crypto sleuthing firm TRM Labs, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Thursday.Redbord, a former prosecutor for the Department of Justice, said that finding strategies to identify and trace illicit activity will mean developing better “blockchain intelligence tools” that can identify new mixers before bad actors can get to them.“Bad guys are getting better, and their tactics are becoming more sophisticated,” Redbord said. “But the reality is the tools, regulation and the investigators and law enforcement are also becoming more sophisticated.”Read more: This Was the Worst Year for Crypto Hacks. Here’s How 2023 Can Be Better / OpinionAccording to TRM Labs, more than $3.6 billion in funds have been drained in crypto this year. About 80%, or roughly $3 billion, targeted decentralized finance (DeFi).That's because many DeFi platforms are new and haven't developed robust cybersecurity tools yet and because the platforms have a lot of liquidity, he said.During the same segment on ""First Mover,"" Erin Plante, vice president of investigations at Chainalysis, another crypto sleuthing firm, said that many attacks are occurring on bridges that are used to transfer assets between different platforms.Chainalysis found that “sophistication in money laundering” is becoming harder to decipher as bad actors look to cash out on centralized exchanges that are likely to be unaware that the funds are stolen because the bad actors have hidden the funds' source through the use of multiple mixers.Crypto mixers, which operate like black boxes, give users the ability to send and receive bitcoin (BTC) anonymously.“There’s really a need to continue to evolve the intelligence and the tools to be able to identify the new mixers that are popping up in those places,” Plante said.Read more: Are Crypto Mixers Legal? / Opinion",2022/12/29
10,"Even as cryptocurrency and other digital assets resident on blockchain have increasingly permeated the public consciousness, the question of regulatory authority has largely gone unanswered. Often, seismic events in the financial industry, like the collapse of FTX, lead to clarity.Here, unfortunately, instead of leading to any kind of consensus, the early signs indicate that the demise of FTX and its repercussions on other crypto companies have only reinforced the disagreements between the different stakeholders on how, or even whether, to regulate crypto.Aitan Goelman is a partner with Zuckerman Spaeder, LLP and the former Director of Enforcement at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This article is part of Crypto 2023.By now, most people are familiar with the saga of FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder, majority owner, and, until recently, wunderkind CEO of the now-defunct crypto exchange. Before his abrupt fall from grace, “SBF,” as Bankman-Fried has become known, had the ear of public officials, regulators and celebrities, and a public image as the kinder, gentler, face of crypto.After a November 2022 article in Coindesk reported that the bulk of the holdings of Alameda Research, SBF’s trading firm, were in FTX’s token, a run on the bank was triggered. That led to SBF’s resignation and forced FTX and related entities into bankruptcy, with FTX’s customers and investors out billions of dollars. SBF was subsequently indicted in the Southern District of New York (S.D.N.Y.) for a variety of crimes, including wire fraud, conspiracy and money-laundering, stemming from his alleged use of assets belonging to FTX’s customers to plug a shortfall in Alameda and his alleged lies to investors.Read more: 2023 Will Be the Death of Bitcoin Energy FUD | OpinionThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed enforcement actions against SBF as well, alleging that his actions violated the securities laws and the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), respectively.Until FTX’s demise, it and SBF had been seen as the white knights of the crypto world, repeatedly riding to the rescue of other troubled companies in the sector. This made some contagion from FTX’s collapse inevitable, although to this point, the damage appears largely confined to other crypto companies, customers and investors, rather than to the traditional financial system.It is worth noting that, while SBF is now incarcerated and faces a potentially lengthy prison term and unfavorable comparisons to Bernie Madoff, he had previously been a champion of increased regulation of the crypto markets, including by lending his support to proposed federal legislation which would have undoubtedly prohibited much of his conduct, including the use of customer funds to prop up Alameda.There has never been a dedicated regulator of crypto, at least in the U.S. Various federal agencies, including the Department of Treasury, the SEC and the CFTC, each have different pieces of regulatory responsibility. Certain state agencies have carved out roles for themselves as well, with the New York Department of Financial Services, for example, issuing its own “BitLicenses.”In this patchwork of different regulatory authority, the legal basis for the CFTC’s jurisdiction is clearest. The Commission has repeatedly held that crypto can be a commodity under § 1(a)(9) of the CEA, which falls under its regulatory umbrella, and this interpretation has been endorsed by federal courts as well. As a result, the CFTC has asserted its regulatory authority over crypto derivatives, and its anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement authority over transactions in spot crypto.There has been considerably less consistency in the SEC’s approach to crypto. In the last administration, the SEC seemed relatively uninterested in crypto. Its only notable effort was to belatedly take action against the spate of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), which were fairly clearly unregistered securities offerings, but eschewing any attempt to more broadly regulate crypto.The SEC has been far more aggressive under Chair Gensler, who has repeatedly suggested that the vast majority of tokens are securities. Gensler’s Enforcement Division has launched a host of investigations into different tokens and has adopted an expensive interpretation of “investment contracts” under SEC v. Howey, 328 U.S. 293 (1946).See also: The Next Wave of Institutional Digital Asset Adoption | OpinionDespite this, the SEC’s ability to show that these tokens are actually securities under current law is far from certain. The agency did manage to persuade a New Hampshire district court that the cryptocurrency LBRY was a security. However, it is facing a stiff challenge in SEC v. Ripple, 20 CIV 10832 (S.D.N.Y. 2020), where the defense, led by former SEC Chair Mary Jo White and former Enforcement Director Andrew Ceresney, are arguing that Ripple’s token is not a security by using public statements (and, now, internal SEC communications) made by another former top SEC official, William Hinman, about why Ether did not qualify as an “investment contract” under Howey.This has resulted in an unusually public turf battle between the CFTC and SEC, and even led CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham to issue a statement condemning the SEC’s decision to bring charges in SEC v. Wahi. Quoting Federalist No. 49, Commissioner Pham called the SEC action “a striking example of ‘regulation by enforcement,’” and encouraged the CFTC to use “all means available” to enforce the CEA in the crypto space.In this regard, the SBF charges can be seen as a victory for CFTC. Although the SEC charged SBF with securities fraud, it is related to lies he told to FTX investors, something that is inarguably in the SEC’s wheelhouse. The SEC did not allege that the underlying crypto itself – FTT – was a security, while both the CFTC and the S.D.N.Y. alleged that crypto is a commodity.All three agencies subsequently filed consent charges against SBF’s accomplices and confidantes Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, both of whom are cooperating with the government against SBF.Notably, the SEC did charge Ellison and Wang with manipulating FTT, which the agency described as a “crypto asset security.” The CFTC didn’t address the legal status of FTT in particular, but cited bitcoin, ether and tether as examples of “digital asset commodities.”This pattern of charges could indicate the early outlines of an agreed-upon division between the agencies for tokens that are considered “securities” and those that are not, with the SEC claiming jurisdiction over the former and the CFTC over the latter.However, the fact that the SEC defined FTT as a “security” in its charges against Ellison and Yang, but not in its case against SBF, demonstrates that the agency is bolder in pressing its expansive definition of “crypto asset securities” when it knows it won’t have to fight that issue in front of a judge.Prior to FTX’s implosion, there seemed to be an emerging consensus (or something close to it) that Congress should establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto. This included the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which in October 2022 recommended that Congress pass legislation to provide federal regulators with rule-making authority over the spot market for “crypto assets that are not securities.”The FSOC did not say which regulator should be given such authority, but it appears that it had the CFTC in mind. Further, securities were excluded from the recommended regulatory authority, a move that clearly seemed designed to reassure the SEC that there would be no encroachment on its territory.There are two major pieces of draft crypto legislation circulating on the Hill, and both explicitly provide the CFTC with regulatory authority over large parts of the spot crypto markets.The Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (“DCCPA”), introduced in August by Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and John Boozman (R-AR), extends the CFTC’s regulatory authority to spot crypto. While the bill defines certain cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, as commodities, it offers no detailed guidance on what crypto assets would be classified as “securities,” which the bill exempts from CFTC jurisdiction.To pass, this bill will have to overcome SBF’s earlier public endorsement – a boon at the time, but now may taint the legislation by association.The Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA), sponsored by Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), goes even further toward endorsing the CFTC as the primary crypto regulator. It gives the agency oversight over digital assets that are not securities and lays out fairly restrictive standards for determining that a crypto asset is a security.The senators noted in a joint press release that “understanding that most digital assets are much more similar to commodities than securities, the bill gives the CFTC clear authority over applicable digital asset spot markets” – leaving little doubt as to their intent and openly differing with Chair Gensler’s public statements.Beyond these differences, the two bills have many provisions in common. Both would allow the CFTC to self-fund by imposing user fees on crypto companies, an ability which mimics an authority the SEC has long had and which could be a game changer for the perpetually cash-strapped agency.The last time Congress significantly expanded the CFTC’s responsibilities – when the Dodd-Frank bill brought swaps under the agency’s ambit after the financial crisis of 2008-09 – the CFTC’s budget did not keep pace with its enlarged remit.The ability to impose user fees would help ensure that the CFTC, whose budget (about $320 million) is still a rounding error compared to that of the SEC (approximately $2 billion), can effectively carry out its enhanced mission.Another feature shared by both pieces of draft legislation is the establishment of a new self-regulatory organization (SRO) exclusively for the crypto markets. This is something former CFTC Chair Tim Massad has said should be done regardless of what happens in Congress, and he has suggested that it be overseen jointly by the SEC and CFTC.The collapse of FTX and its knock-on effects in the broader crypto industry has led to renewed calls for urgent action by Congress. But it hasn’t led to unanimity, or even consensus, about the need for legislation, much less how to regulate the industry.Instead, it has largely reinforced the positions already held by the various stakeholders. SEC Chair Gensler has used the FTX saga to reiterate his position that the SEC already has regulatory authority over most coins, and it simply needs more money to do the job.In contrast, CFTC Chair Benham, in congressional testimony soon after FTX declared bankruptcy, noted that the CFTC-regulated American subsidiary of FTX (FTX US Derivatives – once known as LedgerX) was still solvent, demonstrating the effectiveness of CFTC supervision.Crypto enthusiasts reacted to the implosion of FTX by arguing that there are fraudsters in every industry. Some also noted that centralized exchanges like FTX are in many ways the antithesis of the ethos of crypto, which was intended to be a decentralized form of finance independent of the need to trust in institutions or other market participants.Unsurprisingly, the FTX saga hasn’t dented the faith of true crypto zealots, who continue to believe with almost religious ferocity that Web3 and blockchain represent one of the most consequential developments in human history – more important than the development of the internet, approximately equal to the discovery of fire, and perhaps slightly behind the invention of the wheel.More surprisingly, some hardcore crypto skeptics are pointing to the very limited contagion from the FTX collapse as evidence that crypto should not be regulated. They argue that if crypto is brought into the mainstream financial system, it would have the imprimatur of government approval and this would encourage more retail investors to speculate in crypto. As a result, the entire economy would be exposed to the volatility, money laundering, fraud and manipulation that are ubiquitous in (and, to some crypto haters, an inextricable part of) crypto.This regulatory debate illustrates the adage that “where you stand depends on where you sit.” Chairman Gensler, who was an aggressive proponent of the CFTC’s remit when he chaired that agency during the Obama Administration, now believes that virtually all crypto qualifies as a “security.” And then you have the chair and enforcement director of the SEC during the same administration, who are representing Ripple in its battle against the SEC and are among those arguing for a more limited interpretation of a “security.”Meanwhile, crypto companies continue to avoid U.S. jurisdiction. They do so primarily by moving offshore (the headquarters of FTX, like many crypto firms, was in the Bahamas) and by “geo-blocking” Americans, a technique that prohibits those the computer identifies as being located in the U.S. from accessing their platforms – but this is, of course, a far from hermetic seal against anyone with a VPN.The absence of legislation and regulation doesn’t mean the law surrounding crypto is stagnant – it continues to develop through litigation and the interpretation of various enforcement actions. But true clarity won’t come through the slow churn of the legal system, it will come through legislative action. Ironically, FTX’s collapse has, in some ways, complicated the path to Congressional action.In addition to the now-poisonous association with SBF, both draft bills are under renewed criticism for granting primary regulatory jurisdiction to the CFTC instead of the SEC.But suggestions that the CFTC is the crypto industry’s “regulator of choice” and more susceptible to capture by the industry simply don’t hold up against the facts. In 2022, more than 20% of the agency’s enforcement actions were related to crypto. Further, the CFTC sought – and, more often than not, successfully obtained – increasingly significant sanctions.Under its current funding structure, the agency undoubtedly does not have the resources to be fully effective. However, if any legislation retains a grant to the CFTC of authority to levy user fees on crypto actors, the agency’s efforts in the crypto sector will be even more robust.",2022/12/29

12,"Since crypto exchange FTX collapsed into bankruptcy and its Ponzi-like shell game with investor money was revealed, many commentators have doubled down on their criticism of cryptocurrencies as a type of Ponzi scheme.For those who need a review, Ponzi schemes start with an initial investment from an early round of investors, and the money is then used (and spent) for the purposes of the general partners or issuers of the investment product. When the time comes that the original investors want to withdraw their funds, their investments are returned through funds invested by subsequent rounds of investors, giving the illusion of solvency and returns.Similarly, FTX kept making funds available to earlier investors on its exchange using the deposits of subsequent investors – those earlier investments had been swept away to Alameda Research, an affiliated hedge fund.You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.The FTX revelations have led a chorus of voices – including actor Ben McKenzie and Nobel Laureate economist Paul Krugman – to allege that cryptocurrencies in general are a Ponzi scheme.Let’s be clear: Though bad actors are using cryptocurrencies as a medium with which to conduct Ponzi-like schemes, crypto itself isn't a Ponzi scheme.For one thing, tokens like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) do hold value, even in down markets and don't depend on inflows of new money to pay off investors. Rather, holders of these tokens can exchange them for other items of value, or fiat currency, any time they can find a counterparty willing to take their crypto.There is no central entity giving these tokens the illusion of value, but instead, the investing public’s willingness to pay $17,000 or $21,000 or $68,000 for one bitcoin determines the ultimate market value of the token.The most popular cryptocurrencies are able to deliver value in and of themselves without the manipulations of a Ponzi scheme operator.And as a reminder to financial advisors, cryptocurrencies do have fundamentals and real-world use cases.Here are a handful of functions that cryptocurrencies provide:As 2022 comes to a close, cryptocurrencies can be used as a medium of exchange at hundreds of retailers, including AMC Theatres, Virgin Galactic and Cheap Air. Many of these retailers use BitPay, a service that for a small fee converts crypto into the currency of a vendor’s choice within the flow of a transaction.Holders of bitcoin can also convert their coins into fiat cash at bitcoin ATMs or via a debit card prepaid with their tokens.And while many people argue that the volatility of bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies makes them unfit as a medium of exchange, stablecoins that don't fluctuate in value are on the rise.The reputation of stablecoins was tested this year with the collapse of some “algorithmic” stablecoins like Terra/UST. However, they still have the potential to overtake paper currency by accommodating fast, safe and precise digital payments. Central banks are taking this challenge seriously by working to develop digital currencies of their own.Using tokens for cross-border remittances continues to be one of the more popular uses for cryptocurrencies.While many critics have lambasted the volatility and uncertainty of cryptocurrencies compared with fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, many other international currencies suffer from high volatility and inflationary pressures far beyond those felt by the dollar.Tokens like bitcoin are still able to move across borders faster and cheaper than fiat currency.Blockchain technology and digital tokens are being applied to problems far beyond those involving investors, advisors, exchanges and digital broker-dealers.The technology is being applied to issues in real estate, agriculture, healthcare, gaming and supply-chain management, among others.Tokens, distributed through initial coin offerings, are programmable assets that use smart contracts to automatically execute transactions if certain conditions are met without the need of an intermediary. Many industries, not just financial, can benefit from smart contracts that eliminate the need for intermediaries.In 2022, Ethereum, the blockchain represented by ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, underwent a transformation from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain, offering holders of ether the opportunity to generate yield by “staking” transactions on the blockchain. As a result, it has become much easier for many crypto investors to take some income out of their holdings without selling a position.But so-called “yield-farming” opportunities have existed for several years in decentralized finance (DeFi). While some of these opportunities are rife with risk and potential fraud, others offer investors the chance to receive more income more efficiently than they would via low-risk stocks and bonds – even in the current higher interest rate regime.Many investors are going to bet that blockchain will continue to proliferate and that the demand for cryptocurrencies will increase again, driving prices upward from their 2022 swoon. While these may often be pie-in-the-sky hopes for easy money, some credible analysts also expect that the value of major tokens like bitcoin and ether will eventually begin to rise, perhaps growing beyond the peaks reached over a year ago.While advisors generally promote long-term investing over get-rich-quick speculation, for younger clients with high incomes or very high net worth, a little speculation on the potential growth of digital assets shouldn't seriously detract from their ability to reach long-term financial goals.",2022/12/29

Selling pressure on the tokens came because of their close links to disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces charges of fraud and misappropriation of client funds.Thursday's decline put SOL on track for nine straight days of losses, the longest run of declines since Sept. 17, 2021, based on Messari data.Since 2020, Bankman-Fried has been a major proponent of the Solana network, launching the decentralized exchange Serum on the then-upstart network and investing heavily in the platform's projects.Apart from prices, the value locked on Solana-based applications has declined 98% since November last year, DefiLlama data shows. Steep falls in Solana’s metrics came after the implosion of Terra network in May and a market-wide drop in July and after Bankman-Fried's FTX problems first came to light early last month.Alternative currencies outside of the top 20 tokens by market capitalization saw slight changes as well, except for toncoin (TON), which fell 5% over the past 24 hours, and luna classic (LUNC), which dropped 7%.Meanwhile, premarket futures for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 both inched 0.5% higher, pointing to possible gains when the U.S. markets open on Thursday.UPDATE (Dec. 29, 10:03 UTC): Adds SOL's streak of declines in fourth paragraph.",2022/12/29
14,"Several tokens held by Sam Bankman-Fried’s embattled trading business Alameda Research were sold late on Wednesday to the tune of millions of dollars, as the firm's founders face criminal charges related to the collapse of Alameda and FTX, the crypto exchange Bankman-Fried ran.On-chain data cited by crypto research firm Arkham Intelligence suggested $1.7 million worth of tokens from Alameda-linked wallets was sold in the open market over a span of several hours on Wednesday. That sparked concerns on Crypto Twitter that the sales would trigger a steep fall in the prices of those tokens.Bankman-Fried denied being the source of the sales in a tweet on Friday afternoon, saying ""I'm not and couldn't be moving any of those funds; I don't have access to them anymore.""On-chain data showed Ethereum-based tokens such as USD coin (USDC), dai (DAI), curve (CRV), ether (ETH), convex (CVX) and others were consolidated from several wallets to just two wallets and later sold for tether (USDT) stablecoin.The value of the transactions ranged from a fraction of an ether to over 15 ether, the on-chain data shows. The holdings were then converted into bitcoin (BTC) using swapping services like FixedFloat and ChangeNow, on-chain sleuth ZachXBT noted in a tweet.According to Arkham Intelligence data, Alameda still holds over $112 million worth of various cryptocurrencies, down from $140 million held in mid-November, as CoinDesk previously reported.FTX filed for bankruptcy in November after revelations that Alameda, a hedge fund that Bankman-Fried also owned, was largely backed by FTT tokens, digital assets that FTX created out of thin air.UPDATE (Dec. 30, 19:49 UTC): Updated with tweet from Sam Bankman-Fried.",2022/12/29
15,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin, ether and most other major cryptocurrencies spent Wednesday in the red.Insights: In this last week of 2022, First Mover Asia is revisiting a few of CoinDesk's most noteworthy columns. In his latest Crypto Long and Short newsletter, CoinDesk research analyst George Kaloudis considered five of the most annoying events and trends in 2022. Unsurprisingly, topping his list, Kaloudis wrote of his anger at FTX.Another Gloomy Day for BitcoinBy James RubinBitcoin added another dollop of gloom to an already gloomy year on Wednesday.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently down a percentage point over the past 24 hours to about $16,500. BTC has been clinging closer to $17,000 since mid-December amid market concerns about the latest macroeconomic uncertainties and the increased likelihood of Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates.In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Brent Xu, founder and CEO of cross-chain DeFi (decentralized-finance) hub Umee, said that markets seem to be destined to continue their declines well into 2023. ""Markets are going to bottom out around Q2 to Q3,"" Xu said. ""We're going to see another six to 12 months of negative sentiment, possibly 18 months.""Still, he added that he expects ""better developments"" in the long term.Ether was recently changing hands at just under $1,200 for a second consecutive day, off more than 2% from the day before. Other major cryptos were largely in the red amid tepid trading that is typical for most assets as a year closes. SOL, the token of the Solana blockchain, and APT, the native cryptocurrency of the Aptos blockchain system were down more than 11% and 10%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently fell 1.86%.U.S. equity indexes slipped slightly as investors chewed over the implications of China reopening its borders after months of Covid-related lockdowns. The tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a hefty technology component, declined 1.4% and 1.2%, respectively. Stocks usually trade sideways at this time of the year, although a massive sell-off of Tesla's (TSLA) stock this month and Southwest Airlines' (LUV) mass cancellations may alter this traditional course.For at least one day, a couple of faintly positive stories replaced the latest developments in crypto exchange FTX's crisis among industry headlines. Bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK) avoided filing for bankruptcy protection after agreeing to sell its Dickens Country, Texas mining facility to Galaxy Digital for $65 million and securing a $35 million loan from the crypto-focused financial-services firm.Earlier in the day (Hong Kong time), CoinDesk also reported that MicroStrategy (MSTR), the business software vendor that was co-founded by crypto proponent Michael Saylor, has added to its bitcoin stockpile, purchasing about 2,395 bitcoins for $42.8 million between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21 through its MacroStrategy subsidiaryUmee's Xu said that the recent uptick in macroeconomic conditions and crypto price stability has been troublesome for options trading. ""If you're an options trader, not a lot of volatility,"" Xu said. ""Whenever there's any price movements, they're not going to be sustained long enough form some notable trend.""It's just not the best time for investing in crypto assets,"" he added.5 Crypto Things That Riled Me Up in 2022By George KaloudisEnclosed are just five of the crypto-related things that got under my skin in 2022.

The FTX/Alameda/SBF fraudThis is probably the umpteen-millionth time you have read some version of a crypto person being mad about this, but I’m still mad at FTX (for the fraud), the reckless risk-takers (for the flexing) and many Twitter-ers (for the hero worship). I think the fraud speaks for itself. The embezzlement (or whatever it was) at FTX hurt real people.

Crypto hedge fund founders flexingMy brain is raising at least two pitchforks for the folks at crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). It’s one thing to be a little annoyed with highly leveraged hedge funds (like 3AC) doing risky things in general; it’s another to be annoyed at the associated flexing (i.e., “showing off”) that took place on social media and elsewhere as highly leveraged hedge funds raked in the cash the last few years.But it was revealed during liquidation proceedings that 3AC co-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu paid for a $50 million superyacht with company funds all while flexing that “100K ETH is dust.” Calling 100,000 ether “dust” was calling $400 million “not a lot of money.” 3AC collapsed.

16,"Debate has accelerated in recent days over the future prospects of Solana, a layer 1 smart-contract blockchain that in some respects competes with Ethereum. The chain grew rapidly and saw immense hype during the 2020-2021 bull market, particularly from venture capitalists. But the recent departure of major projects to other chains and a massive drop in total value on the Solana chain have raised questions about its future prospects.Lingering technological challenges are a common worry cited by doubters. Competition from Ethereum layer 2s represent a growing threat to Solana’s core premise of faster and lower-cost transactions. But the biggest cloud shading Solana’s sunshine is the fall of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the FTX exchange and hedge fund Alameda Research.David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.Bankman-Fried was perhaps the single most prominent backer of Solana, and skeptics could reasonably argue that the price appreciation of the SOL token and related assets from 2020-2021 was driven at least in part by Bankman-Fried’s market interventions and advocacy.The consequences of growing Solana skepticism have been dire, based purely on numbers. From a peak price of $258.78 on Nov. 6, 2021, Solana’s SOL token has declined to just over $10. That’s a drop of 96%, vastly sharper than the drawdown from peak for BTC (-74.5%) and ETH (-74.6%). It’s even a sharper drop, incredibly, than dogecoin (DOGE) has seen in the bear market – the meme coin is down a mere 76% from its October 2021 local high, though it's 87% down from its May 2021 all-time high.From its position as the fifth-most valuable crypto token in early November, Solana’s SOL token has dropped to 19th place, according to data from CoinGecko.See also: Solana DeFi Project Mercurial to Relaunch, Replace TokenThe total value of tokens staked in decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocols on Solana has declined even more dramatically, from nearly $10.2 billion on Nov. 9, 2021 to under $210 million at press time – a decline of nearly 98%. Solana is now only the 12th-largest DeFi chain by total value locked or TVL, trailing not only Ethereum layer 2s like Polygon and Optimism, but also far more obscure projects like Cronos and DefiChain.The single sharpest percentage drop in Solana’s metrics came in early November following the collapse of FTX, and mounting evidence of massive fraud by Sam Bankman-Fried. It now seems increasingly likely that some of Bankman-Fried’s extensive support for the chain was funded via FTX’s wholesale theft of customer funds.Former Alameda executives including CEO Caroline Ellison, moreover, have claimed in recent statements to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that Bankman-Fried encouraged market manipulation of FTX’s FTT token. Given that, it seems improbable that Bankman-Fried wasn't also manipulating the price of Solana-based projects he helped launch, controlled large stakes in and used in the accounting and loan fraud that formed the core of the FTX swindle.Those related projects, including the Serum decentralized exchange and the self-described DeFi brokerage Oxygen, are sometimes derisively referred to as “Samcoins.” They have seen catastrophic declines in their own token prices, and Serum was rendered “defunct” by the collapse of FTX, necessitating a community fork.Market manipulation via Alameda would have effectively been funded by the clandestine redirection of FTX customer funds from other assets, such as bitcoin and ether, toward the trading of SOL or other ecosystem tokens. Alameda’s market-making and trading activities as a whole appear in retrospect to have been wildly unprofitable. Some critics have argued that their SOL activity would have amounted to propping up the value of Solana, while artificially holding down the price of blue chips like ETH and BTC.This chaos has led to hints of something like a death spiral as developers and projects depart the struggling chain. Most dramatically, the DeGods and Y00ts NFT (non-fungible token) projects were confirmed to be leaving Solana for Ethereum and Polygon, respectively. In November, stablecoin issuer Tether swapped $1 billion of USDT from Solana to Ethereum.All this comes on top of worries that predated the collapse of FTX. Solana has experienced repeated chain halts since its inception, often caused by “botting” or other forms of spam overwhelming the network. This is inextricably linked to Solana’s core value proposition as a faster, cheaper layer 1 than Ethereum: For a blockchain, lower transaction costs and higher speed often come as a trade-off for security and stability.See also: Is Solana Leading Crypto Into Retail or Trailing Apple? | OpinionMoreover, that value proposition may itself be less compelling than it was when Solana launched in March 2020. The years since have seen significant growth in “layer 2” products on Ethereum that offer faster and less expensive transactions, but gain the benefit of Ethereum’s security, mostly through the use of “rollup” technology. Those new competitors include Optimism, a layer 2 that launched in December 2021 and now has more than twice as much value locked as Solana.These are serious headwinds, and commentators across the crypto industry have been debating the chain’s prospects in recent days. In a best-case scenario, Solana’s remaining builders face a long road back to ecosystem health and relevance. The big question is whether there are enough of them, with enough conviction, to go the distance.",2022/12/28
17,"MicroStrategy (MSTR), the business software vendor that was co-founded by crypto proponent Michael Saylor, has added to its bitcoin (BTC) stockpile, purchasing about 2,395 bitcoins for $42.8 million between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21 through its MacroStrategy subsidiary, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday.Last Thursday, the company sold about 704 bitcoins for $11.8 million on the premise that a loss on the transaction would offset previous capital gains.Then on Saturday, the company acquired an additional 810 bitcoins for $13.6 million, bringing its total holdings up to 132,500 bitcoins.

""This deal with Galaxy achieves all of these goals, and it lets us live to fight another day.""The transaction will help Argo bolster its balance sheet and avoid bankruptcy after it found itself in a precarious situation when a deal for $27 million in funding fell through in October. Earlier this month, the miner said that it was in advanced negotiations to sell some of its assets and carry out an equipment financing transaction to avoid filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.The deal with Galaxy was structured to boost Argo's balance sheet and capital structure, Chris Ferraro, president and chief investment officer at Galaxy, told CoinDesk. When the miner kicked off its process, ""we were in a position to solve the problem completely for Argo, while accelerating the expansion of our own mining capabilities,” he added.The crypto miner's shares more than doubled in early London Stock Exchange trading. On Tuesday, the company requested a 24-hour suspension of trading in its Nasdaq-listed stock, while the London market was closed for a U.K. bank holiday.Argo is among several miners that are struggling to stay afloat amid rising energy costs low bitcoin (BTC) prices.Earlier this month, Core Scientific (CORZ), one of the largest miners by computing power, filed for bankruptcy, and in September, Compute North, another major firm in the sector, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Last week, bitcoin miner Greenidge said that it reached a debt restructuring deal with its lender Nydig, although the prospects of a bankruptcy filing still loom.Helios, which was Argo's largest mining facility, has up to 180 megawatts worth of power capacity and will become Galaxy's flagship mining operation.

Less than a month after a CD story led to the implosion of crypto exchange giant FTX in November, Chief Insights Columnist David Z.

And sign up for First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.Frozen Markets, a Bitcoin DriftBy James RubinBitcoin drifted lower in Tuesday trading, albeit not by much as investors continued their historical, year-end hibernation. Crypto prices remain frozen near the levels they've held for much of the past two weeks.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently changing hands at $16,700, off 1.3% over the past 24 hours but near its most recent support just under $17,000. BTC's price has remained resilient over the past two months, despite the widening fallout from the implosion of crypto exchange FTX.In a CoinDesk TV First Mover interview, Martin Leinweber, digital asset product strategist at Market Vector Indexes, noted bitcoin's strength relative to other cryptos. ""If you look at the coins that demonstrate relative strength, which means coins that fell the least amount from the all-time high, you will notice names that nearly no one would have imagined, especially when you consider the ranking,"" Leinweber said. ""So bitcoin was not the most defensive coin, one might expect from a store of value.""Ether was recently trading just over $1,200, also down 1.3% from Monday, same time. Most other major cryptos were slightly in the red with LINK, the token of software platform Chainlink, and CRO, the native cryptocurrency of exchange Crypto.com, each sinking more than 2%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, fell 1.15%.Major equity indexes closed mixed after a good news, bad news day in which China announced it would allow international travelers to enter the country again but Russia said it would ban oil sales to countries that had placed a $60 per barrel price cap on it – the latest fallout from Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. How the moves will affect prices worldwide is uncertain. Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of global energy markets, was recently selling at $85 per barrel, an 11% gain over the past three weeks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 1.4%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up slightly.Meanwhile, FTX's sad, unsavory saga continued with documents filed in Caribbean court showing that former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars from Alameda Research to purchase his stake in trading app Robinhood Markets (HOOD).In an affidavit before his arrest, Bankman-Fried said he and FTX co-founder Gary Wang together borrowed over $546 million from Alameda via promissory notes in April and May. They used that money to capitalize Emergent Fidelity Technologies Ltd., the shell corporation that in May bought a 7.6% stake of Robinhood.The FTX crisis has renewed calls for stronger regulation some seven months after the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin lost its dollar peg. The consequent collapse of the Terra ecosystem during the spring jolted lawmakers who had been hesitating to create stricter guidelines targeting digital assets to ratchet up their efforts. As yet, little concrete has resulted, although many crypto insiders expect changes in the year ahead and beyond to protect investors.Market Vector Indexes' Leinweber said he would embrace stablecoin regulation. ""I welcome those regulations,"" he said. ""It will lead to more dollars in that space. There are some unregulated, poorer constructed ones. But they're also good stablecoins.""FTX’s Collapse Was a Crime, Not an AccidentBy David Z. Morris, CoinDesk Chief Insights ColumnistIn the weeks since Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency empire was revealed to be a house of lies, mainstream news organizations and commentators have often failed to give their readers a straightforward assessment of exactly what happened. August institutions including the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have uncovered many key facts about the scandal, but they have also repeatedly seemed to downplay the facts in ways that soft-pedaled Bankman-Fried’s intent and culpability.It is now clear that what happened at the FTX crypto exchange and the hedge fund Alameda Research involved a variety of conscious and intentional fraud intended to steal money from both users and investors. That’s why a recent New York Times interview was widely derided for seeming to frame FTX’s collapse as the result of mismanagement rather than malfeasance. A Wall Street Journal article bemoaned the loss of charitable donations from FTX, arguably propping up Bankman-Fried’s strategic philanthropic pose. Vox co-founder Matthew Yglesias, court chronicler of the neoliberal status quo, seemed to whitewash his own entanglements by crediting Bankman-Fried’s money with helping Democrats in the 2020 elections – sidestepping the likelihood that the money was effectively embezzled.Perhaps most perniciously, many outlets have described what happened to FTX as a “bank run” or a “run on deposits,” while Bankman-Fried has repeatedly insisted the company was simply overleveraged and disorganized. Both of these attempts to frame the fallout obfuscate the core issue: the misuse of customer funds.Banks can be hit by “bank runs” because they are explicitly in the business of lending customer funds out to generate returns. They can experience a short-term cash crunch if everyone withdraws at the same time, without there being any long-term problem.But FTX and other crypto exchanges are not banks. They do not (or should not) do bank-style lending, so even a very acute surge of withdrawals should not create a liquidity strain. FTX had specifically promised customers it would never lend out or otherwise use the crypto they entrusted to the exchange.CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist David Z. Morris unpacks his latest opinion piece that argues Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of troubled crypto exchange FTX, is a fraud.See also: Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried's Crypto Empire Blur on Alameda's Balance SheetIn reality, the funds were sent to the intimately linked trading firm Alameda Research, where they were, it seems, simply gambled away. This is, in the simplest terms, theft at a nearly unprecedented scale. While the total losses have yet to be quantified, up to one million customers could be impacted, according to a bankruptcy document.Read the full story here11 p.m. HKT/SGT(3 p.m. UTC): U.S. Pending Home Sales (Nov.

21,"Midas Investments, an investment firm that focused on DeFi (decentralized-finance) yields, is shutting down its platform following its losses this year, according to a blog post from CEO and founder Iakov “Trevor” Levin on Tuesday.Levin wrote that this past spring, the Midas DeFi portfolio lost $50 million, or 20% of its $250 million in assets under management, and that after the collapse of crypto lender Celsius Network and exchange FTX, 60% of the assets on Midas' platform were withdrawn.“Based on this situation and current CeFi market conditions, we have reached the difficult decision to close the platform,” Levin wrote, referring to centralized finance.The company will now focus on a new project that “aligns with our vision for” centralized decentralized finance (CeDeFi), Levin said.Starting on Tuesday, Midas disabled deposits and swaps, as well as withdrawals, for some time while it makes calculations and balance adjustments. Its target is to deduct 55% from user balances held in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and stablecoins, with the adjustment being compensated for in MIDAS tokens that can be swapped in for tokens of its new project.“The goal of the new project is to create a win-win situation by connecting competing protocols with liquidity and offering a simplified yield to a range of DeFi and CeFi audiences,” Levin wrote.Levin is a contributor to CoinDesk.",2022/12/27
22,"The policy environment for crypto in 2022 began full steam ahead. The industry had grown significantly, institutional adoption was growing by leaps and bounds and policymakers had taken notice. Many of the players on the financial side of crypto, including the exchanges and those building financial products on blockchain, ramped up their involvement in the policy conversation in Washington, D.C.Policymakers that had been historically skeptical began to see the value of the technology and the growing impact it could have on traditional financial markets. Critics were being increasingly sidelined, given the perception of tremendous opportunities in the space, and friendly regulation appeared to be in the offing. With regulatory certainty being addressed, the industry could flourish. In May 2022, that positivity in the policy community came to a screeching halt.Chris Hayes is a senior government relations executive focused on financial regulation. He previously led global government relations for a layer 1 blockchain. This article is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.The collapse of Terra’s UST stablecoin (which, behind closed doors, some in Web3 talked about as being inevitable) as well as that of many centralized lending platforms in the crypto space sent the industry into a cold winter and provided a strong narrative to skeptics of not only the crypto industry but, worse, the usefulness of blockchain technology itself. The implosion of FTX in November has provided more fuel to this narrative, with significant consequences for policy making. An organization that presented itself as the poster child for responsible management and consumer protection turned out to be a house of cards, even worse than the Enron example.For all the losses to depositors, customers and damages to the industry’s reputation, the FTX implosion surprisingly has also resulted in an opportunity. There now appears to be some bipartisan consensus in the U.S. Congress that new digital assets legislation is needed to protect consumers. The 118th Congress that begins its work in January will likely pass some sort of regulatory framework for crypto and blockchain technology in 2023 or 2024. This framework will shape the way the industry operates for years to come. This is why it’s critical that the entire Web3 industry be involved in that conversation, and most critically, layer 1 blockchains and the builders on these platforms.I often hear from those new to Web3 or blockchain technology (including in my old TradFi world) that they “see the value of the blockchain technology, but that crypto is worthless.” Unfortunately, these comments are common by those who don’t realize that a blockchain needs native cryptocurrency to process transactions, incentivize validators and secure the network. Those less familiar with the technology, including many policymakers hostile to crypto, still haven’t heard of the job creation and economic growth potential of the companies building on top of blockchain infrastructure. Layer 1s, as the building blocks to the entire industry, must bring these founders and companies to the forefront to tell the story of the technology and its potential for real-world application. A technology-forward message is needed now, not a financial message.See also: The End of Crypto Twitter as We Know It? | OpinionAny new crypto legislation or Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulation must provide clarity for layer 1s and their native tokens while ensuring sufficient consumer protections. This means finally addressing the lack of clarity around the application of the Howey Test to these types of digital assets, including delineating whether they belong under Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or SEC jurisdiction. Should certain layer 1 native tokens ultimately be considered securities, any legislation or SEC rulemaking must provide safe harbor for those existing blockchain tokens in circulation and must arrange for an updated SEC registration regime that addresses the technological differences presented by digital assets. If the SEC will not begin a rulemaking process utilizing its existing authority, Congress must require the regulator to do so.Industry leading layer 1 blockchains must collaborate on policy engagement, delivering a uniform message that regulatory clarity is needed beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Only this will allow this important technology to continue to develop here in the United States, driving the technology companies of the future.",2022/12/27
23,"In 2021, Bitcoin and Ethereum accelerated further into the mainstream as the leading two blockchains on the planet, respectively. Both networks have deeply dedicated communities and developers working to protect and evolve the peer-to-peer technological innovations.Crypto advocates enjoy both systems for their unique characteristics and economic principles. Bitcoin has an extremely strict monetary policy aiming to be the most sound, decentralized money on the planet. Ethereum is an ever-evolving general purpose blockchain, which, one can debate, has sound money attributes but with a less-predictable token issuance schedule.Bill Ottman is the CEO and co-founder of Minds.com. This article is part of Crypto 2023.The majority of crypto users, investors and developers think multiple technologies can coexist. Some think bitcoin could be considered the hardest money known to humankind, while also acknowledging that Ethereum has creative capabilities in decentralized finance (DeFi) and notable smart contract composability.However, there’s a massive, exhausting debate between so-called “maximalists” on both sides who are hypercritical of the other network. Bitcoin maximalists dislike the term “crypto” itself because it conflates Bitcoin with scams and muddies the waters for new adopters. (Crypto derives from cryptography, the underlying security foundation that makes decentralized monetary networks possible.)The practice of calling anything other than Bitcoin a scam (or, less artfully, a s**tcoin) is sometimes labeled “toxic maximalism.” Online bitcoiners who defend the network against detractors and attack “imitators” are what MicroStrategy’s former CEO Michael Saylor called a “cybernetic immune system.” Historically, maximalism isn’t rare in tech – though it often results in embarrassment for any outspoken critics of, say, cars, planes, phones and the internet.Whatever the technological differences separate Bitcoin and Ethereum, it’s clear both networks also have a strong cultural and psychological divide. These different ecosystems and different aims have an impact on how the networks will progress.For instance, non-technical bitcoiners often say that “Bitcoin can’t be changed,” but let’s take a look at the specifics of both governance models and how exactly they are, in fact, different.Read more: End of the Monopoly: How Bitcoin Will Usher in a New Era of Governance in CryptoThis year, Ethereum transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake (consensus algorithms that determine how blocks of transactions are added to the chain). Last year, Bitcoin introduced Taproot, which reduced transaction fees, increased privacy and provided more wallet functionality. It is likely that the next major change will be BIP-119, which could provide additional benefits for the Lightning Network (Bitcoin’s scaling layer).Not long ago I had the opportunity to interview former Bitcoin Core developer Samuel Dobson to learn how the governance and development process actually works in Bitcoin. Typically, there aren’t nearly enough technical details discussed when communities criticize the other’s governance processes. It’s doubtful that most critics have ever even spoken to a core developer on either side.Apart from the handful of tools common to most blockchain governance processes (like Git merge requests and comments, live chat and mailing lists), Bitcoin and Ethereum do have their similarities.Both projects have relatively small groups of core developers (counted in the dozens). In the case of Bitcoin Core, only a few have commit access (aka maintainers, or those who can set updates to go live). Both projects utilize “rough consensus,” have long periods to scrutinize proposals (i.e., BIPs and EIPs, or Bitcoin or Ethereum Improvement Proposals) and make minor changes quite regularly. In Bitcoin these changes are called “standardness rules,” which are not consensus critical and can be changed relatively often.Both projects have also had rare bugs that have been dealt with in relatively centralized ways.For Bitcoin: On Aug. 15, 2010, a hacker created over 184 billion BTC due to a number overflow error. Bitcoin's total supply is meant to be capped at 21 million, so clearly this wasn’t acceptable. Ninety minutes later, Jeff Garzik spotted the issue. Satoshi can be found discussing a fix here and then implementing it. He said, “Once more than 50% of the node power is upgraded and the good chain overtakes the bad, the 0.3.10 nodes will make it hard for any bad transactions to get any confirmations.”For Ethereum: In 2016, shortly after The DAO launched and raised $150 million worth of ether (ETH) through a token sale, this first decentralized autonomous organization was hacked due to vulnerabilities in its code base. The Ethereum blockchain was eventually hard forked to restore the stolen funds. Not all parties agreed with this decision, resulting in the network splitting into two distinct blockchains, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.At the most basic level, Ethereum doesn't work like Bitcoin in that it doesn't have a single reference implementation. Each implementation has committers (e.g., Go-Ethereum, Nethermind, Besu, Erigon) but none of them is sufficient to change the entire protocol.Bitcoiners typically resist “consensus changes” that are changes that could create a fork and change the fundamental rules of the peer-to-peer (P2P) networking protocol. “Standardness rules,” however, are more flexible due to not being consensus critical. Bitcoin resists hard forks but accepts soft forks, which are not consensus changes, but are a strict subset of the previous rules. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin actually wrote about the issue.Ethereum has a specification (spec) that multiple clients are based off (the aforementioned Geth, OpenEthereum, Besu, Nethermind, Erigon), while Bitcoin Core is what all Bitcoin clients are based on (Bitcoin Core, Knots, Rust BTC, BTCD).Read more: 23 Blockchain Predictions for 2023At the social level, Ethereum has the Ethereum Foundation (EF), which was founded to help direct development of the network and was funded through the sale of ETH. Bitcoin Core is not a legal entity, it is software.In reality, both projects have numerous legal entities involved. While the Ethereum ecosystem is definitely more reliant on a smaller set of entities (EF, ConsenSys), there is no one entity that is the central coordinator. If EF or Consensys disappeared tomorrow, Ethereum development could continue as there are many independent teams developing core clients and other components of the ecosystem. Considering the number of players involved in the Merge, it’s a ridiculous criticism to say Vitalik is essential to its continued existence.Likewise, Satoshi Nakamoto actually disappeared. This left Bitcoin without a specific human to direct the network or target to take it down – a feature, not a bug. However, Bitcoin Core is still a loose organization, with owners of a Github account and reportedly a multisig wallet used for funding developer travel and accommodations at meetups. This wallet is intentionally kept on a need-to-know basis.Finally, generally speaking, Bitcoin favors soft forks and Ethereum favors hard forks.Too often the debate between Ethereum and Bitcoin about how to address protocol governance lacks perspectives from core developers. In reality, there’s a limited understanding of what’s actually happening on the ground for both networks.There have been a couple of useful interviews to come out of the “What Bitcoin Did” podcast hosted by Peter McCormack where a former Ethereum core team member, Lane Rettig, expressed concerns about the centralization of control in Ethereum (though he admittedly still supports the project). What was frustrating about the podcast was the lack of technical specifics from the Bitcoin Core perspective.In reaction to the interview, Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation said, “FWIW, most people in the Ethereum community I've spoken to disagree with a lot of Lane's criticism. It's a [three-hour] interview, so it's quite long to refute, but I wouldn't paint it as the consensus Ethereum view.”The ""Bankless"" podcast held a productive debate called “BTC vs ETH: Which is Better Money?” which covered some nuances of the process of both sides. But the conversation, like most conversations contrasting BTC and ETH, had more to do with economic policy than governance itself. The humans involved and tools used to govern matter greatly.The last podcast worth mentioning had Alex Gladstein debating Erik Voorhees on how the different blockchain technologies work and their varying levels of decentralization. The very concept of a “spectrum of decentralization” is positive – and shows how both Bitcoin and Ethereum have their own weaknesses and benefits. Voorhees argued both are overwhelmingly similar – though noted a clear difference in that Bitcoin’s economic policy sets it up as a long term sound money system.Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are fascinating networks whose differences help the world become more decentralized because they thrive in complementary areas. It’s also beneficial that certain people are interested solely in one or the other.Decentralization applies to both computing power and governance, and both are essential in determining the holistic level of decentralization.Samuel Dobson, the former Bitcoin core dev, expressed to me in our conversation that the difference is largely psychological with the participants. Bitcoin’s purpose is for maximum predictability and security, while Ethereum is more focused on constant innovation and composability.He said, “The Bitcoin community has a kind of in-built inertia. It's really hard to change things because it is really hard for a lot of people with diverse interests to agree on the changes. A lack of ‘leadership’ is a feature not a bug in this world.“Things moving slowly ensures that things are done safely with plenty of discussion, review and testing. We've seen first hand on certain forks of Bitcoin the impact of big changes being rushed through. In this way, the psychology of the Bitcoin community is a big part of its decentralization.Read more: Ethereum Developers Target March 2023 for Release of Staked Ether“Ethereum, on the other hand, places a lot more trust in Vitalik and the others to decide on the direction of the protocol. That's not to say they all follow blindly, of course – it is still an open-source project with review and discussion. But the endorsement of a relatively small group of individuals there allows much bigger changes to proceed much faster.“Their leadership is very centralized compared to Bitcoin's. I think that difference is more psychological than tangible: They're willing to sacrifice decentralization of development in favor of the ability to move quickly and ""experiment"" with lots of new changes.”In reaction, Ethereum’s Beiko noted Bitcoin has a few core devs with much more social capital and influence than the average contributor. Ethereum is similar in that regard – even if criticisms of Vitalik’s continued presense often feels like a strawman. By the numbers, Ethereum has many more people involved in its development.“In many ways, our development process is more decentralized,” Beiko said. No one person in Ethereum can “unilaterally force a change.”In the end, both network’s continued existence – despite the perceived threats they present to the established order – show what decentralization really means.",2022/12/27
24,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin held steady throughout the Christmas holiday weekend at about $16,900, while most other major cryptos were flat, although tinted more green than red.Insights: In this last week of 2022, First Mover Asia is revisiting a few of CoinDesk's best and most impactful stories from the past year. In a column last week, columnist David Z. Morris considered one of the upsides to the series of debacles that have deeply wounded the industry. Morris argues that investors' growing uncertainties about crypto's future will root out careless speculation and refocus attention on ""good deals and ideas.""A Quiet Holiday Weekend for Bitcoin, Other CryptosBy James RubinBitcoin held steady over the long Christmas weekend as investors largely ignored crypto and the macroeconomic uncertainties that have plagued the world in 2022.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $16,900, just about where it stood 24 hours earlier and where it finished Friday as markets wound down for the holiday. BTC is likely to continue in the same vein during the year's final days given business' historical, end-of-year slowdown.""Bitcoin looks like it might be finding a home between the $16,000 and $17,000 zone,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign-exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email.Ether was recently changing hands at slightly over $1,200, mirroring bitcoin's flat trading of the past three days. The second-largest crypto by market cap was up 0.5% from Sunday, same time. Other major cryptocurrencies were recently flat, although tinted more green than red. XRP, the token of open-source, public blockchain Ledger XRP, was among the biggest gainers, rising 5.4% to over 36 cents. ADA, the token of decentralized blockchain platform Cardano, and MATIC, the token of layer 2 platform Polygon, were both recently up more than 2%.U.S. equity markets were closed Monday in observance of the holiday weekend. They rose gently on Friday after the University of Michigan's latest consumer sentiment survey showed an uptick in optimism about the economy. Still, the S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, has dropped for three consecutive weeks.In crypto news, U.S. miners powered down over the weekend as a powerful winter storm swept across much of North America, sending temperatures to historic lows. The bitcoin mining hashrate, a measure of computing power on the blockchain, dropped about 100 exahash per second (EH/s), or 40%, to 156 EH/s, between Dec. 21 and Dec. 24, data from BTC.com shows. It returned to about 250 EH/s as of Sunday.Oanda's Moya was encouraged last week by the court approval of a $37.5 million bankruptcy loan for bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ). In the agreement, Core Scientific, one of the world's largest miners by computing power, reached a deal with some of its lenders to restructure its debt. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Wednesday.""The crypto miner shares are poised to rally which shows you that investors believe in the restructuring support agreement and are still willing to invest in some of the distressed parts of the crypto-verse,"" Moya wrote.There's Less Money in Crypto, and That's a Good ThingBy David Z. MorrisIf there’s one big thing that the mainstream coverage has missed about the various collapses in the crypto space over the past year, it’s this:The downfall of crypto had very little to do with crypto.David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist. This article is part of Crypto 2023.Cryptocurrency is the application of blockchain technology to build uncensorable, open-access and immutable global shared ledgers – usually monetary ledgers. But the headline crimes and failures of 2023 were almost uniformly attempts to use financial engineering to turn the future value of those systems into present-day U.S. dollars.Too often, the finance bros bet big, using the same kind of fragile, nested and interlocking leverage that led to the 2008 financial crisis. Other times they used outright fraud – and they did it off-chain, playing by no rules, with no transparency. They were mistaken for part of the cryptocurrency industry, but it would have been more accurate to think of them as hangers-on and freeloaders, redirecting genuine public interest in crypto to their various unsustainable games.As in much of contemporary finance, the finance bros were extractive rather than additive. They were not builders, but instead a swarm of hatchling vampire squid, little would-be Goldmans frantically shoving their underdeveloped blood-funnels into anything that smelled like money.The epic failures of these finance vampires, plus broader economic conditions, mean that 2023 in the crypto world will be a much different year than 2021 or 2022. Hedge fund gamblers and token-shilling hype men will be relegated to supporting roles, where they belong, as the shadowy super-coders who actually make crypto exist move back into the spotlight.See also: Money Crypto Versus Tech Crypto | OpinionBut 2023 will also be different from previous “BUIDL eras,” during which huge squads of nerds were often set free to pursue whatever seemed cool to them. There will certainly still be some of that, but smart leaders will be pushing their teams much more firmly toward clearer goals: Building accessible and reliable front ends, for use cases with real-world demand, then (hopefully) generating revenue from users. The broad public now has a vague idea of what crypto is (for better or worse). The task now is finding out how to sell it as a tool rather than a speculative investment.This will mean, among other things, less speculation on new tokens, particularly the tokens for new “layer 1” blockchains. In its place will be a relative increase in attention to services that leverage existing, trusted chains and ecosystems to build services with real demand that genuinely require the benefits of blockchains – cross-border fluidity, digital permanence, uncensorability and decentralized governance.Betting on the future (but not building it)This future, of course, assumes that the finance bros have been sufficiently embarrassed to feel some vague sense of humility and that their marks have wised up a bit. Personally, I don’t think that task is quite accomplished. Like unruly dogs beholden to their animal spirits, institutional traders and speculators may still need their noses rubbed into the mess they’ve made. So, let’s do that.Across many sectors of the economy, the 21st-century role of finance has become catastrophically perverted. Rather than risking capital to generate long-term profit by building productive industries, the capital game has become about timing bubbles and picking narratives that will trick naïve investors (retail or otherwise) into becoming bag carriers. Meanwhile you, the pumper, head off to the White Lotus with the cash.This isn’t a problem specific to crypto – especially not over the past three years. The litany of overbought, undercooked and sometimes just plain rotten companies rolls off the tongue: Clover Health (a 2020 Chamath special-purpose acquisition company  on the verge of delisting), Meta Platforms (rebranded around an app with no users), Nikola (an electric vehicle fraud that raised $3.2 billion), Tesla (once pumped, now dumped), Theranos ($700 million in venture capital, another fraud).The task now is finding out how to sell [crypto] as a tool, rather than a speculative investment.The villains of the 2022 crypto collapse were, with one exception, born and bred in this darkness. They saw little more in crypto than the prospect of good hunting. Su Zhu and Kyle Davies started Three Arrows Capital to trade foreign currencies before transitioning to crypto. Sam Bankman-Fried infamously came to crypto from technical trading at Jane Street. Steve Ehrlich of Voyager Digital formerly helped run E-Trade. Alex Mashinsky was steeped in Silicon Valley tech VC and its accompanying blather. The one exception is Terra creator Do Kwon, who did build a crypto network – but did it on the shifting sands of venture capital, leverage and concealed risk.Read the full story here1 p.m. HKT/SGT(5 a.m. UTC): Japan Housing Start (YoY/November)9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(1:30 p.m. UTC): U.S. Wholesale Inventories (November preliminary)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""On the Block"" on CoinDesk TV:Gin Chao: Still Bullish for CryptoIf you have been paying attention to crypto this year, then you’ll know that the industry has been on a roller-coaster ride, losing two-thirds of its value since hitting peaks in November 2021.

25,"Back during the DeFi Summer of 2020 – ages ago in Web3 time – the meme “degens” came about as a way to describe Web3 enthusiasts who were yield farming on systems with high annual percentage yield (APY) and high likelihood of failure. It’s a playful term that’s also revealing of the industry’s mercenary and self-interested side.In the first two years of the decade, driven by headlines, rising prices and FOMO, thousands of traders entered Web3 with the intention of making a quick buck. And despite a steep sell-off this year, crypto continued to go mainstream. There were Super Bowl ads. News of banks using decentralized finance (DeFi). And, yes, negative press about all the bankruptcies.Sadly, with the implosion of custodial systems like BlockFi and FTX a lot of people lost money. That is really bad for the people who were hurt and destructive for the space.Kevin Owocki is the chief executive and founder of SuperModular and co-founder of Gitcoin. This article is part of Crypto 2023.Since Satoshi solved the Byzantine Generals Problem in the Bitcoin white paper, there have been boom and bust cycles in crypto that, from an evolutionary perspective, are similar to natural systems. In times of abundance, thousands of new projects blossom. In times of scarcity, projects fail. The survivors will be the dominant species of the next boom (as visualized in this poster I made).Survival of the fittest is a simple yet powerful mechanism observable in the Web3 ecosystem – the fit best meet the preferences of markets. It might explain why degens, seemingly interested in short-term advancements rather than long-term success, hit a dead end. It turns out purely self-interested behaviors are maladaptive in Web3 (as they are many places in nature).Indeed, the industry that’s now known as Web3 has always had a side of it that is about more than greed and profit. Crypto is a tool for building collaborative organizations and sharing resources – the long-term trends that have always motivated participants.Recently, there’s been increasing awareness and focus on how blockchains, distributed systems with decentralized buy in, support public goods. Public goods are the stuff we all rely on (like open-source software or privacy research) but are hard to maintain and fund.See also: The Next Step in the Evolution of Web3: Regenerative Finance | Crypto 2023Another term for this is “regenerative economics,” the idea that money can be used to incentivise communities to solve systemic issues. Even when open-source projects fail, the exercise can benefit the rest – if everyone is moving along the same axis towards social betterment. Innovate, iterate, evolve, repeat.That’s why, even in the pits of crypto winter, 2023 is ripe to be the year of the regen.Degens came to Web3 seeking financial upside. Regens are those who are working or building in regenerative cryptoeconomics. They have a long-term view on how Web3 can be good for the world, but not just in the financial sense.Regens see how financial systems could be designed to act as channels for greater human flourishing in service of all of humanity’s needs. My friend Gregory Landua, co-founder of the Regen Network, argues people have eight essential needs that could be expressed as forms of capital. Beyond financial capital, there’s our social, material, living, intellectual, experiential, spiritual and cultural needs.See also: How DeFi 'Degens' Are Funding the Next Wave of Open Source Needs | OpinionWith programmable money, we can program our values into our money. Crypto has it within itself to create systems equally as extractive and fragile as the existing financial system. When a degen trades, he’s playing a zero-sum game – the tokens leave his wallet and enter the counterparty’s wallet and visa-versa. But Web3 can also build more positive sum protocols that expand resource capacity over time.There is a common thread linking many people in the regen ecosystem. They used to be degens! Lured by the promise of better economic circumstances for themselves and their family, they entered the ecosystem to make a profit.Over time, however, they grew enamored by the promises of collective action – often through the direct experience of contributing to or using a project. Their attitude and incentives shifted. That’s by design, built into the structure of crypto-economic systems. For instance, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) allow people with a shared mission to come together and pool resources – everyone involved is at least partially aligned in their values and commitments.See also: The One Word That Defines Ethereum's Goals | OpinionWhen you join such a community, you start learning to manage risk and ride the volatility. You think differently about capital allocation. But sometimes it takes more than that to get the bigger picture.Many regens are former degens who took this journey during the last cycle, in 2017. And that’s partially why I’m so optimistic about the future of regenerative systems. There are thousands and thousands of people who are newer to crypto, who came into Web3 in the last year or so, and they are likely on step two of the journey (i.e., down bad) now. They’ve made mistakes and learned from them, a base of knowledge that can serve for a more pragmatic approach to the next market cycle.The window of opportunity is here for newcomers to Web3 to move to step three – find community and discover crypto’s regenerative use cases. From there they will build the next cycle of projects, many that will be positive and impactful for the world.People sometimes say to me, “Hey Kevin, this talk of regenerative crypto-economics is great, but are there any examples of theory in action?”Regen is not just talk. It is happening! In fact, Alejandra Borda and I wrote an entire book detailing 100 different examples of projects where people are using crypto to regenerate the world.To namedrop a few: Proof of Humanity, Celo, Kolectivo and Gitcoin (the crypto-based crowdfunding protocol I built) are all doing worthy things.In this down cycle we have an opportunity to filter the noise from the signal and rediscover our purpose. Through decentralization and peer-to-peer technology we can build a more fair, just and less extractive financial system. We can bring more democratic, more organic financial tools to the masses.As individuals, we can find community, join a DAO and BUIDL on the projects that could serve as the foundation of the next era of Web3. It’s the year to build projects that are democratic, prosocial and net-positive for the world.To regain legitimacy, the Web3 ecosystem must find ways to rotate capital, attention and talent away from the projects that have the best Ponzi-nomics and towards the projects that are going to have the most durable positive impact. We want this not because we want crypto to look good for the world, but because we want crypto to be good for the world.Many of today's most mainstream crypto projects have positive externalities. For example, OpenSea, the largest non-fungible token (NFT) exchange, has allowed thousands of artists to monetize their work and generate new forms of income that are less extractive than their Web2 counterparts.Lens Protocol, a Web3 social media platform that’s generating increasing buzz in crypto amid changes at Twitter, are enabling people to own their own data and to take their social media presence from site to site. Web3 social media has the potential to disrupt tech giants. (Disclosure: I am a Lens Protocol angel investor.)Proof Of Humanity, a registry of 18,000 Sybil attack-resistant identities, is using UBI tokens to pay people a stipend. Gitcoin is a crowdfunding platform that has delivered $72 million worth of funding to public goods and recently released a suite of protocols that allows others to crowdfund for their communities. Kolektivo is a suite of protocols that allow local communities to launch, finance and govern their own regenerative economies.See also: Who Is Building Ethereum's Public Goods? | OpinonWeb3 carbon credit systems such as KlimaDAO and Toucan Protocol allow for better, faster and cheaper carbon credit trading.

26,"Crypto miners across the U.S. powered down over the weekend as a powerful storm swept across North America.The bitcoin mining hashrate, a measure of computing power on the blockchain, dropped about 100 exahash per second (EH/s), or 40%, to 156 EH/s, between Dec. 21 and Dec. 24, data from BTC.com shows. It returned to about 250 EH/s as of Sunday.The practice, known as curtailment, is touted as a way for miners to help electricity grids. The miners' steady demand ensures power producers are bringing in revenue to offset costs, but they can power off when demand from other sources is high, such as during winter storms.The U.S. and Canada have been hit by an Arctic storm that sent temperatures as low as -50°F (-45°C) in the western U.S. state of Montana, according to the BBC, and covered western New York state with as much as 43 inches of snow. At least 37 people died as result of the storm, CNN reported.Foundry USA, the biggest mining pool in the U.S., lost more than half of its hashrate on Dec. 23 – the biggest loss of any major pool – according to statistics from information platform Mining Pool Stats. Foundry is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group.Some of the U.S.’ biggest miners also curtailed operations. These included Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Core Scientific (CORZ), which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last Wednesday. In Texas, 99% of industrial-scale bitcoin mining load was turned off at 6 a.m. on Saturday, Lee Bratcher, founder and president of industry group Texas Blockchain Council, said in a LinkedIn post.Dennis Porter, who advocates for the industry through the nonprofit Satoshi Action Fund, said the miners’ curtailment is proof that they are supporting the electric grid.Denis Rusinovich, a Europe-based miner, tweeted that the big drop in computing power is “another confirmation that bitcoin's geographical diversification is vital.”",2022/12/26

I think the fraud speaks for itself. The embezzlement (or whatever it was) at FTX hurt real people. Rubbing salt in the wound: I got to ask FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried some questions, months before his exchange collapsed, on a CoinDesk TV program, but I failed to touch on anything hard-hitting. We talked about the Super Bowl mostly.Watch: New FTX Boss Condemns Management of the Crypto Exchange During Sam Bankman-Fried's TenureMy brain is raising at least two pitchforks for the folks at crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). It’s one thing to be a little annoyed with highly leveraged hedge funds (like 3AC) doing risky things in general; it’s another to be annoyed at the associated flexing (i.e., “showing off”) that took place on social media and elsewhere as highly leveraged hedge funds raked in the cash the last few years.But it was revealed during liquidation proceedings that 3AC co-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu paid for a $50 million superyacht with company funds all while flexing that “100K ETH is dust.” Calling 100,000 ether “dust” was calling $400 million “not a lot of money.” 3AC collapsed. Also, the superyacht was named: “Much Wow.”Yeah, I know.Much cringe.I think that Bitcoin maximalism, the idea that bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that matters, is fine. Many smart people that I like and respect disagree with me because of the toxic culture it nurtures, but our disagreement isn’t what annoyed me in 2022. What annoyed me is the absolutist language used by maximalism’s adherents. If you don’t understand that you still could be wrong about Bitcoin, then you’re just role-playing as a savior.Also Bitcoin doesn’t have to be “alive”, as former MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor put it on Twitter. Those who tweet that “Bitcoin is [some random adjective]” are just saying stuff for the sake of saying it. It doesn’t make any sense or mean anything at all. And who cares if ether is a security or not? My take is that Bitcoin maximalism would probably be better served if it lived by the adage: “Bitcoin is. And that is enough.”Two weeks ago I complained about Goldman Sachs (GS) co-opting “blockchain” as a buzzword and using it to sell the merits for private blockchain bond issuance. So I’m mad at GS (nothing new here) for selling snake oil.But I’m also mad at effectively centralized chains, such as Binance Smart Chain, for selling snake oil by acting as if they are broadly decentralized. And at the “Ethereum is ultra-sound money” crowd. And at Decentraland users who are angry at journalists for reporting user numbers. And at bitcoiners overstating the impact of Taro as a monumental development when nothing has been delivered to market yet.I’m not mad because I think any of these people are wrong. Yes, maybe one day Decentraland will have more than 810 daily active users and maybe one day Taro will bring stablecoins to the masses via Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. But for now, they aren’t. It’s fine to be excited, but I believe that if we want crypto to be taken seriously at all (which I do), then we’d be better served if we stopped overselling how healthy and vibrant the ecosystem is today.I tweeted earlier this year that this was the “year for privacy.” I don’t think I was correct thematically, but I do want to give more airtime to the importance of privacy as we close out the year.Privacy is a human right and it should be normalized. So it’s probably unsurprising that privacy deniers also irked me in 2022. We don’t have to look far to see the most recent infringement that had a crypto wrapping on it given U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s recently proposed Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, which is less focused on stopping money laundering than it is on infringing on privacy.The shortest version of why I think privacy is important goes like this: You don’t need privacy until the exact moment that you do. And if your retort is that it is only criminals who need privacy, do remember that you are not a criminal until the moment that you are.So to you, privacy deniers, fraudsters and the like, let’s leave all the stuff I don’t like in 2022.",2022/12/25

29,"Bitcoin mining equipment and hosting provider Blockware Solutions was accused by a customer in a lawsuit of breach of contract, negligence, deceptive trade practices and fraud.The case, filed in U.S. federal court in the Northern District of Illinois on Dec. 17, centers around an allegation that Blockware sold Faes & Co. 50 mining rigs for $525,000. But, Faes said in the lawsuit, “Blockware did not actually own or operate a facility to host the miners and was not capable of doing so reliably.” Also, the facilities owned by third parties that Blockware could tap didn’t have reliable power, resulting in subpar service, according to the suit.“As a result, Faes’ miners under Blockware’s management and control have experienced prolonged downtime and inoperability due to lack of power, resulting in significant loss of revenue,” Faes argued. Faes said it has suffered at least $250,000 of damages.London-based Faes said it ordered the machines to be delivered and hosted in Blockware’s own facilities in January, when bitcoin mining was highly profitable amid a bull market. The rigs only came online in April, Faes said. The machines were running with 70% uptime on average as of October, as opposed to the advertised 100%, Faes said.Operational issues, according to Faes, started as soon as the machines were online, which eventually become “nonoperational” in October. Prior to the machines going offline, Blockware was claiming 100% uptime on a 90-day status page, including for a facility in Pennsylvania, where Faes’ rigs were located, often not working, according to the lawsuit.“We disagree with all statements and claims” in the lawsuit, Blockware CEO Mason Japp told CoinDesk. “We are confident it will be tossed out from the court, we have honestly served this industry for over 5.5 years and this has been [the] first filed lawsuit against us.”Blockware is at least the second retail-facing mining company to be accused of operational problems this year. In July, both the CEO and the chief financial officer of Compass Mining resigned following a series of “setbacks and disappointments,” such as delays in machine deployment deploying machines and several thousand rigs being stranded in Russia following sanctions on its hosting partner in that country.Read more: After Countless Bungles, Compass Mining Tries to Change CourseMeanwhile, major industrial-scale miners such as Compute North and Core Scientific have found themselves in bankruptcy proceedings, squeezed between high energy prices and low bitcoin prices.",2022/12/23

The tendency to look for patterns where there are none is helpful in the wild: It’s better to see illusory predators than to miss the ones that are out to kill you. When it comes to thinking clearly, however, it has its drawbacks.Association fallacies are everywhere. From a red herring in a debate to the guilt-by-association that smears public figures, association fallacies skew your strongest-held opinions. At best, it’s why you dislike a rival quarterback. But more seriously it’s the nightmare fuel that allows otherwise reasonable people to resist social, political and technological progress.Pat Duffy is the co-founder of The Giving Block. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023.Crypto has been more victimized by association fallacies in recent history than any other technology – scandals including Mt. Gox, Bitconnect and now Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX taint a whole industry, whatever its part in the catastrophe. Take the instinct to see nefarious patterns where they don’t exist and combine it with default bias (preferring the devil you know to the devil you don’t) and you begin to see why the adoption curve for cryptocurrency is so fragile.Read more: David Z. Morris - There's Less Money in Crypto, and That's a Good ThingIn 2021, crypto was at an all-time high and it finally felt like people were starting to see crypto as a force for good. Now, one bad actor is on the verge of undoing more than a decade of Web3 progress. The actions of one have overshadowed the incredible impact that crypto has had on society, and the number of lives that it has saved since its inception.Crypto has saved people suffering from the fiat crisis in Lebanon, Venezuela and China – providing a way for the average person to buy food, water and medical supplies necessary to survive. Crypto is sparking crucial conversations around banking the unbanked and empowering women in places such as Afghanistan to control their own financial accounts without male guardians.In the charitable sector, crypto is one of the fastest-growing donation methods, with the most generous donors of any investment community. Blockchain-based decentralized IDs are saving refugees from losing their life savings or being separated from their families. Crypto is leading the way on privacy and transparency simultaneously, shielding human rights advocates from retribution by tyrannical regimes, while creating a fully transparent Bitcoin blockchain that has lived for more than a decade without a single record being altered.FTX was bad. But crypto is one of the greatest forces for good on the planet. If we allow the narrative to continue on this path, the association fallacy will snowball, systematically erasing any memory of more than a decade’s worth of positive crypto impact. So, what can we do about it?We can start by abandoning this strategy of sticking our heads in the sand and waiting for this to blow over. Talk to anyone in crypto right now and they’re in a holding pattern. Everyone’s worried about putting their foot in their mouth, so the only stories people see are negative stories about former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and FTX. This might be a good strategy for not putting our feet in our mouths, but it’s not doing anything about the feet that are kicking us while we’re down. If you’re not speaking up right now you’re a part of the problem.Continue showcasing all of the good that crypto is doing around the world. Typically, the holiday season is full of heartfelt stories about the impact of crypto. Crypto is still saving lives every single day, but those stories aren’t being told the same way they were prior to FTX’s collapse. If the crypto community can come together to tell these stories they are less likely to be forgotten.It’s one thing to discuss the positive impact that crypto has made on the world, it’s another to put your money where your mouth is and use your crypto for good. Though crypto philanthropy is such a small part of the crypto story, its impact has been felt globally. You don’t have to donate much, but every single donation shows the world that crypto can make real, tangible changes to this world.From our side, at The Giving Block we’re going well beyond that, starting “The Crypto is Good Project,” which will focus on compiling data, profiles and reports on the ways in which crypto is a force for good. If you’re in crypto, now is the time to take a little time and build a use case that matters.If the crypto community seizes this moment to shed light on the bright side of crypto, we’ll put FTX behind us and go back to changing the world. If we don’t, people will continue to look at us and see SBF. That’s our choice right now. I’m hoping more people make the right one.",2022/12/23
31,"Crypto price movement was relatively mild this week.Despite the soap opera surrounding Sam Bankman-Fried’s arrest, extradition and incredible shrinking $250 million bond, crypto assets appear to be ignoring the noise and trading on the basis of fundamentals, sentiment and basic supply and demand.This is welcome news for markets in that focus can now shift to factors that are more connected to valuations. One factor that stands out is the decline in trading volume, understandable given the time of year. Crypto traders can be forgiven for a break after an exhausting and painful year.The weekly chart for bitcoin (BTC) shows an approximate 50% decline in trading volume on Binance, along with a 17% decline in trading volume for ether.Bitcoin’s seven-day performance versus the U.S. dollar was middle of the pack (ninth) this week relative to the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.By contrast, BTC finished third in the prior week. Its absolute performance was stronger, however, gaining 1.4% versus a 0.9% decline last week.Ether’s 4.7% increase was a mirror opposite of last week’s 4.6% decline. ETH landed third on the performance list. BNB led the way with a 6.4% gain.There was a much narrower dispersion of performance this week, with winners and losers ranging from 6.4% to -3.1%, compared to 30.6% to -15.4% the week prior.Bitcoin and ether remain range-boundOur thoughts on bitcoin’s chart are relatively unchanged from our thoughts a week ago.Momentum is fairly stagnant, with BTC's Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading remaining in fairly neutral territory.Past trading activity shows significant price agreement between $16,500 and $17,000.

32,"It has been more than a decade since Satoshi introduced the world to the peer-to-peer electronic cash system called Bitcoin, and yet the regulatory landscape for crypto-assets remains a dark forest. After one of the most eventful years in crypto to date, what can we expect from the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (crypto’s primary U.S. market regulators) in 2023?The SEC nearly doubled the size of its crypto-asset enforcement team in early 2022 and will likely continue to regulate by enforcement in 2023.Michael Selig is counsel at Willkie Farr & Gallagher. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023.SEC Chair Gary Gensler believes that the “vast majority” of crypto assets are securities. He said “probably only a few” may not be securities. While he might “think CryptoKitties is not a security,” the SEC is also reportedly investigating non-fungible tokens.The SEC regards many crypto assets as a type of security called an “investment contract.” In SEC v. W.J. Howey & Co., the U.S. Supreme Court defined an investment contract as a contract, transaction or scheme whereby an investor invests money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.During his prior tenure as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Gensler oversaw the implementation of new swap market regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. As SEC chair his approach to regulating crypto assets resembles his CFTC approach to regulating swaps. The Gensler-era CFTC disregarded industry opposition and leveraged the existing futures regulatory framework to hurriedly adopt a swaps regulatory framework that did not work for much of the market.Read more: Adam Miller - 2023: The Year DAOs Follow the Law?In the case of crypto assets, Gensler has “asked the SEC staff to work directly with entrepreneurs to get their tokens registered and regulated, where appropriate, as securities.” However, it appears unlikely that rules specifically tailored to crypto assets will be proposed during 2023. Gensler’s view is that most crypto assets are securities and therefore most crypto-asset issuers and intermediaries are subject to the same laws and regulations as other securities issuers and intermediaries. Gensler may face pushback from the Republican-controlled House Financial Services Committee in 2023, but is not likely to reverse course.The regulatory narrative will continue to be shaped by the SEC’s enforcement actions. Since 2017 the SEC has brought dozens of actions for failing to register offers and sales of crypto assets as securities. These actions have mostly involved “utility tokens” sold in the days of initial coin offerings. The legal theory advanced by the defendants in many of these cases has been that the crypto assets were not part of an investment contract because the assets had consumptive use and therefore purchasers should not have reasonably expected profits. But lower courts have thus far rejected this argument, concluding that a crypto asset may be sold as part of an investment contract even if it has consumptive use.More recently, crypto projects have shifted their focus to decentralization and community ownership. It is common for projects to issue crypto assets as a means of distributing governance and control over a network, protocol or organization to a broad and dispersed community. The legal theory likely to be advanced by these projects under the Howey Test is that such crypto assets are not securities because there is no “other” upon which holders of the crypto asset rely to earn profits.As certain of the SEC’s more longstanding lawsuits against crypto-asset issuers conclude next year, the SEC may announce novel enforcement actions involving crypto assets associated with more decentralized crypto networks, protocols and organizations. The CFTC brought its first enforcement action against a decentralized autonomous organization this year and it may not be long before the SEC follows suit.Gensler has emphasized that crypto market intermediaries (“whether they call themselves centralized or decentralized”) must register with the SEC. This signals that the agency may prioritize actions against intermediaries in 2023. These actions could test the theory that a crypto asset initially offered or sold as part of an investment contract remains an investment contract even when it is traded in secondary markets. In this regard, SEC v. Wahi, where the SEC alleges a crypto-asset exchange (Coinbase) employee engaged in insider trading, is a case to watch.The CFTC has limited authority over crypto assets. It has exclusive jurisdiction over commodity derivatives, but only holds anti-manipulation and anti-fraud jurisdiction over commodity spot transactions. Its jurisdiction over crypto assets is based upon its position that bitcoin, ether, tether and other crypto assets are commodities.CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam has requested “clear authority to impose [the CFTC’s] traditional regulatory regime over the digital asset commodity market.” Earlier this year, bipartisan legislators in the U.S. Congress introduced competing bills that would each establish a crypto market intermediary registration regime overseen by the CFTC. These bills are likely to be reintroduced in 2023. After recent crypto market events, a comprehensive crypto bill that expands the CFTC’s jurisdiction may see broad support. However, neither bill would establish a bright line between SEC and CFTC jurisdiction over crypto assets. Gensler believes that most crypto assets are securities and Behnam has not challenged this view. In fact, he has advocated for “shared responsibility” between the agencies. Regardless of what happens on Capitol Hill in 2023, the CFTC is unlikely to win jurisdiction over all crypto assets.The CFTC has been active in regulating by enforcement. More than 20% of the agency’s enforcement actions in 2022 involved crypto assets, and it is not likely to let up in 2023. Although the agency does not comprehensively regulate crypto-asset spot markets, the CFTC has recently begun to seek crypto-asset trading bans against defendants. This signals that the agency regards itself as the cop on the beat for non-security crypto asset markets. The CFTC’s lawsuit against the Ooki DAO made headlines this year because it raised novel legal questions. One question: Are decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) “unincorporated associations” and can they be served with notice of the lawsuit through an online chatbot and forum? This is a case to continue to watch in 2023.* * *The crypto-asset regulatory landscape will likely remain a dark forest in 2023. SEC Chair Gensler believes the majority of crypto assets are securities but is not in favor of new crypto market rules or guidance. On the other hand, CFTC Chair Behnam seeks additional CFTC authority over crypto assets but the agency is currently limited in its ability to issue rules or guidance for these markets. While crypto projects continue to push the boundaries of decentralization and community governance, the SEC and CFTC will likely push the boundaries of their existing authorities through novel enforcement actions. With neither agency poised to issue new crypto rules, 2023 will be the year of regulation versus decentralization.",2022/12/23
33,"If Elon Musk’s controversial leadership of Twitter sends the platform into the slow death spiral many are predicting, what happens to Crypto Twitter?Insider Intelligence this week predicted Twitter will lose 30 million users over the next two years. That’s about 10% of the active user base, but given that many of those expected to remain are likely to be relatively inactive or are bots, the impact on real, human engagement could be significant. It could also breed a kind of reverse network effect, as the smaller community makes the site less attractive, leading to more departures in a negative feedback loop.It is also reasonable to assume that Crypto Twitter, the argumentative “CT” community of crypto enthusiasts, critics, meme propagators, NFT creators, coin-pumpers and related trolls, will also see exits.You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.More to the point: What will the community look like, in terms of its diversity of ideas, after those departures? Given the prominent (if highly imperfect) role that Twitter has played as a forum in which industry stakeholders discuss issues and hash out differences, it’s an extremely relevant matter for the future of crypto.Generally speaking, the kinds of people considering leaving Twitter – some folks are calling for a mass “Twixit” event – are probably different in their political and ideological persuasions from those adamant on staying.Twixit “leavers” likely skew toward a more liberal political bent. Many have expressed discomfort with a reported increase in anti-semitic and racist slurs as Musk has adjusted the moderation policies. Others are angered by the recent suspension of journalists’ accounts. Already half of Twitter’s advertisers reportedly abandoned the platform in the month after Musk took over out of concern about negative associations with their brand. Other corporate accounts are worried that the new CEO’s mass layoffs are leaving the site vulnerable to security breaches.Those “remainers” enthusiastic about the new Twitter and so committed to stay are likely to be more supportive of Musk’s stated mission as “a free speech absolutist” to end “shadowbanning” and remove supposed political bias from content moderation. Many describe themselves as “anti-woke,” expressing concern about culturally imposed constraints on speech that liberals consider offensive. They tend to align with Silicon Valley tech leaders in their ongoing battle with the mainstream press and believe that “citizen journalism” on Twitter provides a more reliable source of information than “biased” news organizations. Their ranks include a large number of libertarian-leaning people who staunchly defend property rights and are suspicious of government intervention and surveillance.That kind of division seems destined to play out in Crypto Twitter because the population of people interested in this technology draws from a similar spectrum of personalities as the general population. (Contrary to mainstream critics’ depictions of a monolithic community of lawless, money-worshiping “crypto bros,” the humans in this field encompass a diverse array of backgrounds and political leanings.)This matters because of the outsized role Twitter has played in crypto discourse. As a decentralized community with no central decision-makers, there needs to be public fora for stakeholders in the industry to hash out ideas and differences. For detailed changes to code, that debate often happens in developer chat rooms, but when it comes to arguments over big, contentious issues, Twitter has played a vital role.Twitter’s place in crypto was cemented during the Block Size War of 2016-2017, climaxing with the implementation of a “user-activated soft fork” in the Bitcoin code, which effectively prevented miners from implementing a proposal from certain businesses to increase the block capacity of the blockchain. On Twitter, supporters of the “small blocks” status quo aggressively propagated the hashtag “#UASF” to successfully stir support for it.If that was the high point, many, myself included, argue that the crypto experience on Twitter has deteriorated significantly since then.The clearest mark of that is the surge in token-shilling bots that fill up replies to tweets and effectively discourage engagement. Musk’s pre-acquisition criticisms of Twitter’s handling of bot accounts and the notion that his move to charge users for identifying check marks could discourage their proliferation offered some initial hope for potential change. But the token bots have kept coming. Meanwhile, at least from this observer’s perch, two other negative experiences of Crypto Twitter appear to have intensified: the toxicity of interactions and the discouragement of nuance and careful readings.Creating a more homogenous, increasingly fortified pool of ideologues, whether of the left or the right, could make things even more unbearable for anyone expressing a view that challenges  that majority. There’s a piling-on effect that happens when one side is disproportionately represented, as encouragement from like-minded users sparks a dopamine release feedback loop to drive abusive behavior. Eventually, when the dissenting minority is driven away, perhaps the toxicity will die down. But then what are you left with? Groupthink.None of this is in crypto’s interest. It’s axiomatic that permissionless, open-source environments thrive on a plurality of ideas from which the “wisdom of the crowd” can be drawn. Indeed, diversity of thought – which, interestingly, is an argument against “wokeness” – is the reason for the one relatively consistent mindset among crypto people of otherwise varying political persuasions: a resistance to centralized authority over the design of this technology.Now, I’m not especially worried that if Crypto Twitter shrinks to the point where it ceases to be a useful, open, multi-viewpoint forum, the crypto community will lose its capacity to properly debate and develop ideas. The era of Web3 may shift us out of centralized social media altogether and into wallet-based, on-chain networks of conversation that, while siloed for specific projects, create links of interoperable exchange across communities in which ideas can intersect, clash and synthesize into new concepts.As my colleague Daniel Kuhn opined, Musk is indirectly offering a clear argument for a decentralized Web3 internet. The contradictions and flip-flops seen in his erratic attempts to define and manage free speech on Twitter are not necessarily a problem unique to him; they are the direct outcome of centralized control, no matter who is in charge. Free speech cannot be “guaranteed” by a controlling private individual with his own natural, human whims and self interests.The real good news is that we’re already seeing the failings of Musk’s attempts to fix Twitter spurring interest in a new, crypto-friendly alternative: for instance, Nostr, the open-relay protocol that’s seeking to build a censorship-resistant social network, now with former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s financial support. Meanwhile, Mastodon is gaining support.It was fun while it lasted. But Crypto Twitter’s demise mightn’t be a bad thing.",2022/12/23
34,"Craig Wright has been given permission to appeal a Norwegian court ruling concerning his claim to be Satoshi Nakomoto, founder of Bitcoin, CoinDesk has been told.In October, Judge Helen Engebrigtsen of the Oslo District Court ruled that Magnus Granath (who goes by the Twitter handle Hodlonaut) had been entitled to post tweets in 2019 calling Wright a “fraud” and a “scammer” for saying he was the true founder of Bitcoin.Wright’s right to protest that ruling has now been upheld by the Norwegian Court of Appeal, lawyers involved in the case have told CoinDesk, offering yet another twist in an already tangled series of legal cases.“For Dr. Wright, this decision means that the Court of Appeals will hear his case and render its own independent decision,” Wright’s attorney, Halvor Manshaus, told CoinDesk in a statement.“The case involves other non-economic interest, aside from just the monetary claims, and may also raise important legal principles for the court to address,” Manshaus, a partner at Oslo practice Schjødt, added. The lawyer cited such issues as “defamation, protection of the personal sphere and harassment.”Granath’s lawyers, meanwhile, attempted to play down the significance of the decision in a jurisdiction where there is a presumption that any case can be heard twice.“There is nothing dramatic or unusual about the decision” by the appeals court, said Ørjan Salvesen Haukaas, a partner at DLA Piper, in an email.Manshaus told CoinDesk back in October of Wright’s intention to appeal, saying that “anonymous online bullying” could have a “chilling effect” on public discourse. Granath (Hodlonaut) hoped to use the Norwegian case to forestall an unfavorable ruling in the U.K., where defamation laws are stricter.In the U.K., Wright scored a partial legal victory on Wednesday when he was awarded 900,000 pounds (US$1.1 million) in costs in relation to a separate claim made by podcaster Peter McCormack. Wright was previously awarded only nominal damages by U.K. Judge Martin Chamberlain, who said Wright had “put forward deliberately false evidence.”In her judgment, Engebrigtsen said Granath had “sufficient factual grounds” for his tweets, after witnesses at the trial demonstrated discrepancies in the documents Wright used to prove his claims, such as typefaces that weren’t around in 2008.In tweets sent on Wednesday, Wright appeared to signal he was giving up on legal attempts to prove he invented Bitcoin.Read more: The Bullied Takes the Bully to Court",2022/12/23

Is it possible 2023 is the year energy FUD around Bitcoin finally dies?Kent Halliburton is the president and chief operating officer of Sazmining. This article is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023.So-called “green bitcoiners” made themselves heard over the past 12 months, and they’ve brought novel ideas to the fore. Troy Cross, professor of philosophy at Reed College in Oregon and fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, has broached several ideas on bitcoin (BTC) mining and energy with which bitcoiners are still wrestling.Together with Yale-NUS professor of philosophy Andrew Bailey, Cross has been arguing that bitcoiners have a sort of moral duty to uphold related to bitcoin and the environment. They say their ideas is a “way to invest in bitcoin without contributing, even slightly, to unsustainable bitcoin mining.” (Their white paper came out in late 2021, but gained traction in 2022.)Meanwhile, Cleantech investor Daniel Batten put together groundbreaking research into bitcoin mining, and may have found a way to put a significant dent in humanity's methane problem. Batten has explained through careful calculations how and why bitcoin mining is the only available technology that can mitigate humanity’s methane emissions at scale.Finally, in 2022 Jason Maier crowdfunded and wrote his book, “A Progressive’s Case for Bitcoin.” He makes the case that Bitcoin is, contrary to critics, a net positive for the environment. In 2022, several bitcoin-focused companies launched with a mandate of proving the viability that the Bitcoin blockchain could contribute to fighting climate change through competition and free markets. Synota, for instance, was founded this year and raised a $3 million seed round to pursue its mission.The company’s platform allows energy companies and their customers to trade energy and money more frequently and with less friction than traditional payment rails allow. It’s a use that may “promote global energy abundance by integrating Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and energy,” they write.Read more: The More Energy Bitcoin Uses, the BetterDid you hear of the company that converts landfill waste into BTC? Vespene launched this year, and uses methane emissions from landfill as fuel to power bitcoin miners, putting into practice what Batten theorized. In August, it closed a $4.3 million funding round to continue its pioneering project into carbon-negative mining.Finally, Jack Dorsey’s digital payments company, Block, and Alyse Killeen’s VC firm, Stillmark, recently invested in a company that builds out renewable bitcoin mining sites in parts of Africa that have excess power. Still at the seed stage, Gridless, in 2023, plans to launch a hydro mining site in Malawi and a solar-powered mining site in West Africa.Admittedly, critics of the Bitcoin network’s energy consumption and environmental impact have made a meaningful dent on adoption.

36,"As cults of personality and centralized platforms lose their sheen, we must return to the fundamentals that drove the crypto industry at its inception: decentralization, self-custody and economic empowerment for all. In a phrase: decentralized finance (DeFi).DeFi brings a lot of diversity to our economy, but one specific sector of DeFi that will continue to see prolonged, exponential growth in 2023 is the derivatives market, and even more specifically options trading. The reasons for crypto options' high probability of growth in the new year can be pinned to massive yet-unrealized potential for trading in both retail and institutional capacities. If we learn to read the markets, make smart use of the data at our disposal and overcome a few speed bumps along the way, options will certainly drive the next era of DeFi to higher highs than ever before.Greg Magadini is director of derivatives at Amberdata.

This shows how popular options are. And for good reason – options are, essentially, insurance policies that allow the ability for investors to tailor trades and risk tolerance, which is why they’ve remained a popular investment strategy during the bear market.Options give traders, well, options. Think about insuring your home – certainly every homeowner will carry fire insurance to help protect their investment. This behavior is what allows you to tailor or insure the risks that you don't want to take, and basically trade that risk away to someone else. With options you're able to express investment views that incorporate new elements; instead of just saying “price go up” or ”price go down,” you can say “price go up by this date,” or “in this timeframe” or “with this velocity.”And while the crypto options market continues to grow extremely fast, there is still plenty of room for growth. If we consider the market cap of bitcoin versus the outstanding notional open interest of crypto options, it's about 6%. Whereas in traditional finance, that number is 200%. Let’s call it an opportunity to see a 30 to 35 times increase just to match the same sort of relative levels as traditional finance.So, what’s holding the options market back from achieving this growth in the here and now?Read more: The Year Crypto Yields Blew Up | OpinionOn the surface, there are a lot of similarities between crypto options and traditional finance (TradFi) options. But the main difference is that we’re still learning how external events affect the crypto market, while in TradFi people know how to identify big mover events. TradFi investors have access to earning reports or substantial company news covered by the media. These events inform traders what the smartest trades will be, as long as they pay close attention. But crypto is the exact opposite.In crypto, we don't necessarily know what it looks like when an encryption algorithm breaks. When someone tweeted that Vitalik Buterin had died, ether (ETH) temporarily “crashed” on the “news” before swinging right back. With such fast-moving tech, there are numerous events and forks that are necessary and common, and yet people don't know how they will affect the market. Even the Ethereum Merge in September – a hugely anticipated event that had people expecting extreme volatility – came and went and the prices remained remarkably stable.See also: 2023: The Year Blockchain Becomes a Sustainability Solution | OpinionThe lesson? We don't know how to value the true potential of crypto yet, and we know even less about how it should move based on volatility events. But all is not lost. Not only do trading strategies like options provide us with ways to mitigate losses and customize risk levels, but the way our underlying blockchains are designed provides us with access to an enormous amount of consistently-generated, granular data such as spot data, which provides a true source of price and volatility. Analyzing this data will teach us to recognize trends and movement events. And the best part is the more use DeFi gets, the more data we have at our disposal and the more we learn. DeFi only gets stronger as it grows.DeFi options will continue to see exponential growth due to their dynamic nature, massive investment prospects and, soon, ease of access and use. There are currently many competing models, and certainly many questions still loom large, especially with regard to regulation. Yet, as things mature we can expect to see the barriers fall. More investors will see DeFi for the next evolution in our economy that it truly is. Options trading will help drive this adoption, because as an investment strategy it offers immense utility to institutions and retail traders alike.",2022/12/23

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has been released on bail after appearing in U.S. federal court in New York on Thursday. Bankman-Fried was told he can live with his parents on $250 million bail secured in part by their Palo Alto, California, house. His release also includes a long list of requirements for him to remain free while he faces charges. He's not allowed to make financial transactions of more than $1,000, can't open new lines of credit, can't leave the house except to exercise and must go through substance abuse and mental health treatment, according to the agreement.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is increasing its scrutiny of audits of cryptocurrency companies in an effort to warn investors who may feel assured by audits such as proof-of-reserve reports. “Investors should not place too much confidence in the mere fact a company says it’s got a proof-of-reserves from an audit firm,” said Paul Munter, the SEC’s acting chief accountant. Having such a report “is not enough information for an investor to assess whether the company has sufficient assets to cover its liabilities,” he added.Tron founder Justin Sun was a top client of crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments. A private financial document reviewed by CoinDesk shows that Sun, one of the richest figures in crypto, was responsible for the vast majority of a key Valkyrie division’s assets under management. He had more than $580 million of bitcoin stashed with the asset manager at one point in August. This amounted to over 90% of money at Valkyrie’s largest division, Valkyrie Digital Assets LLC.",2022/12/23
38,"Cryptocurrency exchange OKX published a second proof-of-reserves (PoR) report, adding features that allow users to verify that the second-largest platform by trading volume has sufficient assets to handle customer withdrawals.The report, released Thursday, shows that as of Tuesday, 12:00 UTC, OKX's wallets held 113,754 bitcoin (US$1.87 billion) against a user balance of 112,192 bitcoin (BTC). That's a bitcoin reserve ratio of 101%, a slight decline from 102% disclosed in the first report released on Nov. 22.The reserve ratio for leading stablecoin tether (USDT) held steady at 101%, while ether's (ETH) reserve ratio ticked higher to 103% from 102%. The exchange addresses tracked by analytics firm Nansen show BTC, ETH and USDT make up over 90% of holdings.Proof of reserves is an audit method adopted by cryptocurrency exchanges in the aftermath of FTX's collapse to prove that the custodian, in this case OKX, isn't lending out customer funds, as FTX did, and has the assets it claims to hold on behalf of its users. These reports have, nevertheless, been criticized for not providing information about liabilities and internal quality controls, a focal point in the crypto community. For instance, Binance's recent proof of reserves report from French audit firm Mazars was criticized for lack of details about the way exchange liquidates assets to cover margin loans.OKX said in a press release shared with CoinDesk that it would release proof of funds on the 22nd day of each month to win customer trust and allow users to audit its 23,000 addresses, which the exchange plans to continue using in the future.Users can now view and download the old and new reserve ratios and assess the exchange's health and the safety of their assets.“Publishing PoR results on a monthly basis strengthens our commitment to lead the industry when it comes to transparency and trust,” Chief Marketing Officer Haider Rafique said in the release. “At OKX, we believe that PoR should be verifiable via open source tools so that users can self-verify the balances and ownership of our reserve addresses.”",2022/12/23
39,"Over 100 bitcoin belonging to collapsed crypto exchange QuadrigaCX has left wallets tied to the exchange, with a majority flowing through a privacy tool. That probably isn’t good news.You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.QuadrigaCX is back in the news! For those of you who weren’t here back then: A Canadian crypto exchange collapsed in dramatic fashion in January 2019 after its founder apparently passed away in India due to complications from Crohn’s disease.It turned out the exchange owed thousands of customers around $200 million in crypto (at prices at the time). It later came out that the exchange’s founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten, had misappropriated customer funds for personal purposes. He also left behind little paperwork or records, making it difficult for investigators to actually verify what assets or liabilities Quadriga had... Sound familiar?That’s ancient history by current standards. Ernst and Young, a Big Four auditor, is acting as the company’s bankruptcy trustee and has spent much of the last 3+ years investigating Quadriga, trying to find the company’s assets and recover what funds it could. The Canada Revenue Agency is also digging into Quadriga, checking on taxes the exchange may not have filed when it was operating.Early on, in February 2019, EY revealed it had accidentally sent over 100 bitcoin (BTC) to what it described as Quadriga’s cold wallets, which it could not access.Last Friday, someone pulled all 104 BTC out. And promptly moved at least 70 or so of that to Wasabi Wallet, a privacy service. EY confirmed it wasn’t anyone on the auditor’s team, implying someone has either had access to these wallets for the last four years or someone found the keys after nearly four years. Either way, it’s yet another blow to the crypto exchange, which is still going through its bankruptcy proceedings.Crypto analytics firm Chainalysis said the movements are similar to bitcoin that left defunct trading service BTC-e’s wallets a few weeks ago.This is obviously not great news. EY and Miller Thomson, the law firm representing Quadriga creditors, did not return requests for comment earlier this week. In nearly identical statements, the two firms said they were investigating the “unauthorized transactions.”A number of questions will have to be answered. Why did EY believe the addresses in question were cold wallets, and what work have they done over the past four years to try and verify that they couldn’t find the keys?Furthermore, the case at this point appears to be held up largely by the Canada Revenue Agency, but EY hasn’t published any reports on the bankruptcy case since January 2021, and its last notice to creditors was in February 2021. Crypto prices have changed dramatically since then, so it’s unclear what exactly creditors will recover.Sam Bankman-Fried is now in the U.S., having been extradited Wednesday from the Bahamas, just over a week after police in the Bahamas arrested him.While he was in the air, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams announced that Bankman-Fried’s former associates – onetime Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX-co-founder Gary Wang – had pleaded guilty to various charges and were cooperating with prosecutors.

40,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin avoids losses in U.S. stocks as strong economic data makes investors reconsider expectations that the Federal Reserve will pivot anytime soon to a more dovish monetary policy.Insights: Central Bank of Indonesia white paper on the development of the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) envisions a world with a government-sanctioned payment layer.Bitcoin dodges stock sell-offBy Bradley KeounBitcoin (BTC) was flat over the past 24 hours, on a day where U.S. stocks sold off. Positive economic data rekindled fears that the Federal Reserve may need to keep tightening monetary policy longer than expected – a trend that has put downward pressure on risky asset prices all year. (Check out Glenn Williams Jr.'s analysis here.)The largest cryptocurrency by market volume was trading above $16,800, down just 0.01% over 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the second largest, was trading around $1,223, up 0.82%. The CoinDesk Market Index was up 0.5%Messari's Ryan Selkis, in a 168-page report on his 2023 predictions, wrote the market's direction is ""still all about macro and regulation.""""The resting market sentiment is that we will have a recession in 2023, with some debate over its potential magnitude. The market also seems to trust that central banks will continue to tighten until inflation is under control. Though contrarian, there are some investors who think it’s more likely that the Fed will pivot once the recession really gets going and accept multi-year high inflation in lieu of a depression or global reserve currency crisis.""Web3, DeFi at the center of Indonesian CBDCBy Glenn Ardi, CoinDesk IndonesiaThe Central Bank of Indonesia’s white paper about the development of the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) stands in contrast to China’s: It envisions a world where the government permits, and controls, Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) by providing a government-sanctioned payment layer instead of trying to eliminate it.Indonesia’s population has fully embraced crypto. Based on data from the Indonesian Commodity Futures Trading Authority (Bappebti), the number of registered crypto accounts hit 16.3 million as of September 2022, with a year-over-year growth rate of 81.6%.While the Central Bank of Indonesia sees some negative parts to crypto, such as the ability for it to operate as a ""shadow central bank,"" it knows it needs to work on keeping up, but also not getting in the way either, and with that it's developing a digital form of the Rupiah known as Project Garuda, Indonesia’s CBDC. At this point, crypto is too big in Indonesia to ban, so why not work with the industry and provide regulated payment layers, the prevailing logic goes.“[A] CBDC fills the gap left by existing money by acting as the core instrument for central banks to maintain monetary and financial system stability within digital ecosystem,” a whitepaper from the Bank on the CBDC reads.The bank envisions a market where crypto exists as part of a broader ecosystem, with on-ramps to and from CBDC.“Activities within the Web 3.0 ecosystem, including crypto asset transactions, also add to the complexity of controlling financial systems, both in the context of mitigating micro-financial and macro-financial risks,” the paper reads. “Central banks would need to find a future-proof solution to maintain public trust in them with regards to carrying out their mandate in the digital era.”The Indonesian CBDC, according to the white paper, will be the method of settlement for traditional and digital ecosystem including DeFi, the metaverse and Web3. Cryptocurrency is fine, the prevailing thought seems to go, provided that a digital form of the Rupiah is the dominant means of settlement.This stands in contrast to China’s approach. The country has largely banned most kinds of cryptocurrencies and prohibits crypto transactions almost entirely. The People’s Bank of China white paper on its CBDC mentions cryptocurrency as a concern but takes particular issue with stablecoins, saying they will bring “risks and challenges” to the global financial system.But for Indonesia, stablecoins aren’t a problem. The country already has a handful of rupiah-backed stablecoins such as the BIDR, IDRT or IDK. A big market for these stablecoins is Indonesia’s large diaspora of migrant workers as overseas remittances is a big source of income for the country.In theory, a CBDC could be swapped for a stablecoin, then sent abroad. This method would also have the benefit of allowing authorities to monitor for tax compliance.Still, all this is a long way from being finalized. “The current whitepaper is still high level and theoretical and plans to be implemented,” Asih Karnengsih, chairwoman of Indonesia Blockchain Association, told CoinDesk. “The implementation of the CBDC will take many stakeholders to be involved and the real challenge will be how to invite these stakeholders to join the CBDC system.”But there are security risksA CBDC means that the government would have a lot of information on transactions and users. And Indonesia doesn’t have the best record for IT security.In January 2022, the Central Bank of Indonesia suffered a ransomware attack that resulted in 74.82 GB of data being leaked. A few months later the country’s national electoral commission was hacked, and the personal information of 105 million Indonesian citizens was sold on the dark web. This comes two years after the same department was hacked, resulting in a leak of 2.3 million voter records.Considering the government’s poor track record of IT security, is it really a good idea to give them so much more information? A CBDC would have details about every transaction a person makes. What price would that fetch on the dark web?In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Sam Bankman-Fried in FBI Custody, Former Associates Plead Guilty: Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda Research, and FTX co-founder Gary Wang plead guilty to fraud charges in the FTX case, seeming to turn against their former boss Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces similar charges.

41,"Known cryptocurrency payments to ransomware hackers “totaled a mere $16 million, compared to nearly $74 million USD in 2021,” blockchain intelligence firm Crystal Blockchain says.This may be surprising given the fact that the number of ransomware attacks has increased since 2021, according to cybersecurity researchers. This year, the notorious Conti ransomware gang, known for terrorizing U.S. hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, ceased operations, but new groups are constantly emerging.Nick Smart, Crystal’s director of blockchain intelligence, told CoinDesk it may be too early to conclude that ransomware attacks are in permanent decline.“Since the Conti leaks, we were able to gather a lot more information on historical ransomware and extortion activity, which is to say we have a better idea of what it was like before. Due to the way ransoms generally work, it’s not possible to tell what happened now as many companies don’t disclose payment information publicly,” Smart said.Analysis of on-chain activity shows that crypto services with a high money laundering risk score – meaning they receive funds from scams and cybercrime more often than others – are seeing a drop in popularity, the report says.“We can see that overall, crypto funds are increasingly exchanged between lower-risk [virtual asset service providers] likely due to increased regulation, registration and client expectations,” the report reads.At the same time, crypto exchanges and services that manage to keep “dirty” crypto out, have been further tightening anti-money laundering policies, effectively scaring away criminal actors: “The volume of funds sent to low-risk exchanges from scams fell by 24% in 2022 compared to 2021,” the report said.Offline wallets, allowing users to directly control their funds, are becoming increasingly popular among crypto users in general, the report says: more funds are being sent to such addresses.Cross-chain bridges remain popular for illicit transactions. The Bitcoin-to-Ethereum bridge service Ren, for example, received almost a half of all crypto from sanctioned entities, the report said. The service, linked to now-failed exchange FTX, is popular among hackers.“Perhaps the biggest endorsement of this trend was the FTX thief, who almost drained the entire of the protocol’s liquidity crossing chains,” Smart says. That’s not something new: Cybercriminals have been actively using Ren even before. However, the recent enforcement actions benefited the protocol.“I think a lot of the attention on Ren grew after Tornado Cash was sanctioned [by the U.S. Treasury Department], which goes to show that criminals are always evolving tactics to try and beat blockchain intelligence companies and compliance teams,” Smart said.",2022/12/22

43,"In a world where giants of the conventional financial system including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal employ tens of thousands of employees, Bitcoin continues to be run by a tight ship of just a few dozen active developers.New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG), a Bitcoin-focused investment firm, published a report in September chronicling Bitcoin’s 14-year evolution from a software development perspective. The report, titled “Developers of Bitcoin,” found that there are only 40 to 60 active developers. The document sheds light on how Bitcoin has steadily grown from an obscure technological breakthrough, to worldwide domination, and examines the software developers who made it all happen.What’s most mind-boggling, perhaps, is how the world’s most dominant cryptocurrency, currently worth about $320 billion, has been chugging along with no major hiccups for almost 14 years, under the care of a passionate – but small – group scattered across the globe.“The purpose of the report was to help people understand Bitcoin’s development cycle: How it evolved from an idea circulated on a mailing group, to a pervasive technology today. And then, who are the people who continue to update the [Bitcoin] protocol,” explained Greg Cipolaro in a recent interview with CoinDesk. Cipolaro is NYDIG’s global head of research and co-author of the report.Read more: So You Want to Be a Bitcoin Developer?Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder, published his white paper on Oct. 31, 2008, and subsequently launched the Bitcoin network on Jan. 3, 2009. He was soon joined by five other contributors, notably Hal Finney, a developer and cypherpunk who became the first bitcoin transaction recipient (courtesy of Satoshi), and Laszlo Hanyec, a programmer who famously paid 10,000 BTC (almost $170 million today) for two pizzas.Read more: What Is Bitcoin Pizza Day?With Satoshi at the helm, a community formed, but by 2010 that community had outgrown its founder. Realizing this, Satoshi gave Gavin Andresen the keys to the kingdom. Andresen, who was then an active contributor to the project, became Bitcoin’s “lead developer” and moved the project to open source collaboration platform, GitHub, paving the way for true decentralization.“In a final email to developer Mike Hearn, Satoshi declared, ‘I’ve moved on to other things. It’s in good hands with Gavin and everyone,’” the report states.Nowadays, Bitcoin developers can be found worldwide. Roughly 84% of its GitHub commits – or suggested software changes – come from 20 different countries.“One of the interesting things I thought we uncovered in the report is the geographic location of the developers,” said Cipolaro. “It’s helpful for investors who may be concerned about who's contributing and updating this piece of software. We know who they are and most of them seem to be in North America, Western Europe, those types of geographies.”Another shift is the recent shelving of the lead developer/maintainer role in favor of a more egalitarian model that elects a group of maintainers instead. A “maintainer” is essentially a GitHub administrator with permission to approve software changes suggested by other developers.Earlier this year, Gloria Zhao became the first female Bitcoin maintainer in the community's history.According to the report, “code contributions have reached 200-400 commits monthly,” a steady, measured progression. And although Bitcoin’s core protocol averages 40 to 60 monthly active developers, 1,140 developers have contributed to the project since inception, with 5 to 20 new developers testing the waters every month (as others either scale back or leave).The broader ecosystem (developers working on Bitcoin related applications) follows a similar pattern, but, of course, with higher numbers. NYDIG estimates the number of monthly active developers in that wider community to be anywhere from 600 to 1,000, with the total number of contributors being over 13,000 since inception.When compared to competing networks, Bitcoin always seems to come out smaller, but exponentially more efficient. For example, previous estimates from venture firm, Electric Capital’s 2021 developer report, show Ethereum has over 4,000 monthly active developers in its broader ecosystem, compared to Bitcoin’s 600 to 1,000, yet Ethereum’s current market capitalization is less than half of Bitcoin’s.Similarly, traditional payment firms such as Visa and Mastercard, with market capitalizations comparable to Bitcoin’s, are run by tens of thousands of full-time employees. (Bitcoin developers are all volunteers, many of whom are part time.) These numbers seem to not only illustrate the “ultra lean” nature of the Bitcoin machine, but also, the purpose-driven orientation of its contributors.“Do you want the missionaries or the mercenaries? Do you want hired guns to come build things and then they leave when the money's gone, or do you want the missionaries who are here for a purpose?” said Cipolaro. “I think the people who are here for philosophical or ideological reasons tend to stay around longer and make more contributions than those who are just here for the money.”",2022/12/22
44,"Good news is bad news again: Just as traders in cryptocurrencies and traditional finance were looking forward to saying goodbye to 2022, a dose of better-than-expected economic data may have damped the mood for asset prices yet again.At the risk of sounding absurdly obvious, inflation remains an albatross around the neck of global economies. The gallows mentality of markets was that as economic data worsened with growing predictions of a U.S. recession in 2023, the Federal Reserve and other major central banks would ease off on their push to tighten monetary policy – perhaps the single biggest source of downward pressure on asset prices all year.So data released Thursday suggesting the economy might still be humming along has suddenly reversed the narrative. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks tumbled 2.8%, the biggest single-day drop in three months. Bitcoin (BTC) is down 1.1% over the past 24 hours, based on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.The challenge with inflation is that it impacts everyone, and that's a key reason the Fed is unlikely to let up. The decision to purchase a financial asset, whether bitcoin, equities or anything else, is usually discretionary. The decision to purchase food, energy and household goods is not.Declines in asset prices generally burden the owners of those assets. Increases in overall prices act as a flat tax on essentially everybody.The economic data released Thursday shows that this tax isn’t set to decrease just yet.Initial jobless claims: Initial jobless claims of 216,000 were lower than the expected 225,000. Continuing jobless claims were stronger than expected as well.While on the surface this appears to be good news, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized that the labor market needs to “soften.”In the Fed’s view, labor market demand is out of balance with supply. The stronger-than-expected report raises the possibility that the Fed will continue attempts to slow overall job growth to keep wage increases in check.David Tepper, a top-performing hedge fund manager, told CNBC on Thursday, “When the Fed says they’re going to do something, I tend to believe them.”Gross Domestic Product (GDP): The U.S. economy’s third-quarter growth was revised higher to 3.2% from the 2.9% estimate released on Nov. 30. This should also be filed under the “good news = bad news” category. The Federal Reserve would likely prefer to see a contraction of growth as a necessary evil to quell price increases. Much of the growth was driven by increases in consumer spending, which will put upward pressure on prices.GDP Price Index (GDP Price Deflator): The U.S. GDP price index rose 4.4% in the third quarter to a record high. A distinction between the consumer price index and the GDP Price Deflator is that the deflator is designed to capture changes in prices for all final goods and services. The CPI, by contrast, measures price changes for a “basket of goods.” The Deflator is often viewed as a more comprehensive look at price increases. Its move to a record high is likely the exact opposite of what the Federal Reserve wants to see.What does this mean for crypto prices?It’s challenging to find anything positive for crypto prices in these reports.Strong jobs data and economic growth lead to higher prices, increasing the Federal Reserve’s motivation to put a lid on all three. This in turn leads to a decline in asset prices, impacting both traditional and digital assets.Investors in traditional equities should expect to see a negative reaction to positive data as well.

45,"Australian computer scientist Craig Wright may be ratcheting down a multi-year effort to convince courts that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.Wright first caused an uproar in the Bitcoin community with a 2016 blog post in which he claimed – with questionable evidence – to be Bitcoin’s inventor. He’s since gone to court defending his claim, filing lawsuits containing accusations ranging from libel (where he sued Magnus Granath, also known as “Hodlonaut,” for calling him a fraud) to copyright infringement (where Wright successfully petitioned courts to have the Bitcoin white paper removed from bitcoin.org).After six years in the spotlight, Wright seemed to suggest via Twitter on Wednesday that he would finally put his Satoshi court crusade to rest.“I have been too angry for too long, as I cared for external validation. That ends,” he tweeted.“I no longer care what you think. I care for my wife, my mother, and my family,” Wright said. “The only validation I seek now is from my family. The rest is no longer important.”Wright’s tweet thread followed the latest in a series of blows to his Bitcoin inventor claim, which he has thus far struggled to back up with concrete proof in the eyes of courts and much of the public. Just before Wright’s tweets, a judge unequivocally stated that “[i]t is important to be clear that Dr. Wright has not established that he is Satoshi” in the final judgment in a defamation case between Wright and podcast personality Peter McCormack.Although Wright may indeed take a break from litigation, it doesn’t seem he’ll be backing away from his claim to be Satoshi anytime soon. “Creator of Bitcoin” is still proudly displayed on his Twitter profile and website.Per one of Wright’s tweets on Wednesday, “My vision is my goal, and I will never stop working to achieve it.”Read more: Craig Wright’s Satoshi Proofs ‘Not Credible’ and a ‘Farce,’ Hodlonaut Lawyers SayCORRECTION (Dec. 23, 2022 15:02 UTC): Corrected Granath's alias in second paragraph.",2022/12/22
46,"Tron founder Justin Sun is one of the richest figures in crypto, and a good chunk of his bitcoin (BTC) is stored in one place: U.S.-based Valkyrie Investments.The altcoin kingpin had more than $580 million of BTC stashed with the crypto asset manager at one point in August, according to a private financial document that CoinDesk reviewed. That amounted to over 90% of money at Valkyrie’s largest division, Valkyrie Digital Assets LLC, the document shows.In other words, Valkyrie Investments, a money manager that pitches crypto products to Wall Street investors, mostly relied on Justin Sun, a controversial Chinese crypto billionaire. (The current state of Valkyrie’s assets is unknown.) Sun has also said he’s one of Valkyrie’s biggest shareholders.It’s yet another example of centralization in crypto, an industry rife with whales carrying outsize clout, in spite of its decentralized ideals.Sun’s relationship with Valkyrie popped up in ways that benefited his empire. For example, Valkyrie built investment products for “Justin tokens” such as Tron’s TRX and BitTorrent BTT that other crypto asset managers say they avoid. It promoted Tron using the blockchain network’s developers’ own marketing materials. It even let Tron share its spotlight on Wall Street – literally – with someone wearing a T-shirt bearing the Tron logo joining Valkyrie’s bell-ringing at Nasdaq in September.The financial lives of individuals are almost always nobody’s business. Sun’s previously undisclosed, outsized percentage of Valkyrie’s assets under management (AUM) is an exception. The depth of the relationship is a matter of public interest because it raises questions about Valkyrie’s reliance on a single client for growth.Sun is a notable and polarizing figure in the crypto industry. He is the founder of the Tron blockchain, which has spawned repeated controversy. Tron issued, for example, an algorithmic stablecoin that researchers derided as a “clone” of the doomed UST/LUNA setup.Valkyrie Investments Chief Investment Officer Steve McClurg would not discuss the source of Valkyrie’s client funds, citing confidentiality. Sun didn’t respond to a request for comment.Sun’s money touched every section of the business, from separately managed accounts to trusts and even Valkyrie’s bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF). Having large assets under management (AUM) can help a fund manager promote itself to prospective clients and also potential financial backers. Bigger is generally better.For a few months this year, Valkyrie did have another whale, or major investor: It signed a $700 million partnership to manage treasury funds for crypto protocol NEM/Symbol in January. Weeks later, the company said its AUM had surpassed $1 billion, according to a February press release. But that deal fell apart in months and NEM/Symbol took back its tokens, according to people at the protocol.McClurg told CoinDesk that Valkyrie continues to partner with NEM/Symbol. That protocol does not appear on the private Valkyrie document that CoinDesk reviewed.Tokens from Sun's Tron blockchain anchored Valkyrie’s TRX trust, its largest trust at $37 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.Also, Sun in October 2021 called himself the largest investor in Valkyrie’s bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF).It’s not exactly clear why Sun, a knowledgeable crypto founder who recently told CoinDesk he self-custodies most of his tokens (and also has custody partnerships with Binance, Huobi and Fireblocks) would put so much bitcoin in a pricey SMA.SMAs are portfolio management products that Valkyrie sells to investors who want to directly own their crypto but leave the fuss of buying and selling to a money manager. It charged a 1.5% fee when it officially launched its SMA service in October.John Key, the former head of Valkyrie’s SMA product, said Sun’s SMA was an institutional-type product that differed from the retail offerings.Having one whale in an SMA doesn’t necessarily pose a threat to clients with money in other products. But it could become problematic for the asset manager’s fee revenue – and its ability to pay staff – if that client ever decided to leave.“If you had a hedge fund that had six pieces out of seven in the hands of one player, you couldn't swing the budget, if you know what I mean,” said Chris McHugh, an economics professor at Tufts University.Sun may have been Valkyrie’s private whale, but he’s a vocal backer of the Nashville, Tennessee-based firm. He joined its mid-2021 equity round and his Tron blockchain called Valkyrie a “strategic partner” when it launched Tron Trust three months later. As an equity investor in the business, his incentives appear to be heavily aligned with Valkyrie’s.On Valkyrie’s end, CEO and founder Leah Wald has taken a board position at crypto exchange Huobi, which Sun reportedly acquired. Sun is also a board member.Crypto trusts are private investment funds that give accredited investors a way to buy exposure to cryptocurrencies without holding any tokens. Firms such as Bitwise, Osprey, Valkyrie and Grayscale (CoinDesk’s corporate sibling) sell trusts covering a range of cryptocurrencies to the Wall Street crowd. But only Valkyrie sells a TRX trust. Valkyrie also created – but didn’t launch – a BitTorrent trust product.Sun viewed Valkyrie as the Tron ecosystem’s access route to U.S. investors, according to his public statements. In September 2021 he said Tron would work with Valkyrie to list its Tron trust on over-the-counter markets and ultimately help it create a Tron ETF. Both steps would mainstream the cryptocurrency in the U.S. Neither event has come to pass.For its part, Valkyrie discusses its Tron trust with a document chock full of platitudes, buzzwords and paragraphs lifted verbatim from Tron’s own website.“The TRON network completed full decentralization in Dec 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO,” the April 2022 document, which carries Valkyrie’s logo, declared as it parroted language seen on Tron.network in January. At least seven sections of the document appear to be taken directly from other sources without citing them.Though he wouldn’t discuss Valkyrie’s clients, CIO McClurg confirmed that Valkyrie has a partnership with Tron.“I’ve known Justin for many years. We had representatives on the Tron hackathon, we’ve got strategic partnerships with them” and other protocols, he said.The partnership has seen Valkyrie toy with creating trusts for one Sun-linked token that two other asset managers, who requested anonymity, said they would never touch: BitTorrent, software for sharing – or pirating – files. Tron bought BitTorrent for $120 million in 2018 and promptly launched a BTT token to incentivize users.Valkyrie signaled its intent to create a BTT trust with an August 2022 fact sheet and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing in October. McClurg said Valkyrie didn’t move forward with the fund because of the rocky crypto market.Valkyrie’s own finances have been battered by the crashing markets. In recent days it fired 30% of its staff in response to “a thorough review of asset growth.” It also lost its biggest investor in an earlier funding round.Still, McClurg said Valkyrie is soldiering on.“The company’s in a good position. Despite the crypto winter we're growing again,” he said.",2022/12/22
47,"Guggenheim Partners Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd, a top Wall Street financier who made waves in crypto markets for his ever-shifting calls on bitcoin's price, died Wednesday after a heart attack at the age of 63.The firm announced his death in a statement Thursday. He was a regular presence on the financial-news cable network CNBC. According to the statement, he had become the public speaker for Guggenheim, along with serving as a senior leader and a mentor.""Scott was a key innovator and thought leader who was instrumental in building Guggenheim Investments into the global business it is today,"" CEO Mark Walter said in the statement.Among investment executives in traditional finance, Minerd was notoriously willing to venture predictions on the bitcoin (BTC) price, some of them quite extreme, and typically with mixed success.In December 2020, for example, when bitcoin was trading around $20,000, he said that the cryptocurrency ""should be worth around $400,000."" The BTC price climbed to just above $40,000 in January 2021 and peaked around $69,000 late last year.In May, when bitcoin was around $29,000, he told CNBC it could fall to $8,000. It's now around $16,600.As recently as last week, he told Bloomberg Television that there was ""another shoe to drop"" from last month's collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX crypto exchange.""This is just like any number of periods where we had easy money and a lot of speculation,"" he told the channel. ""The weakest players fall first. Crypto was obviously something that is crazy.""",2022/12/22
48,"Bitcoin miners operating in northern Norway and Sweden, where they sought refuge from sky-high electricity prices earlier this year, are powering down for the winter as energy tariffs surge.Just a few months ago, European miners flocked to the continent’s northernmost regions, which have among the cheapest power prices in the world due to abundant hydroelectric power and low demand, as prices across the continent soared. Some even left for the Americas. Now they’re facing record-high prices – and it is only the start of winter, when demand rises for heating.December electricity prices in northern Norway have averaged 18 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) this year, about four times the average of the previous three years, data from the European power exchange Nordpool shows. In Sweden prices are more than three times as high.“It was a shocking alignment of events,” which squeezed the only available energy surplus in northern Norway and Sweden, pushing up tariffs, said Denis Rusinovich, co-founder of mining firms CMG Cryptocurrency Mining Group and Maverick Group.Late November was hit by a combination of low temperatures, which increased the demand for power; a distinct lack of wind that hampered power generation in the U.K., Norway, Sweden and Germany; and delays in scheduled nuclear plant maintenance in France, Sweden and Finland exacerbated by pressure on the supply of natural gas due to the conflict in Ukraine, Rusinovich said.The resulting jump in prices forced miners to turn off their machines to save on power costs. Some had shut down as early as mid-November, Rusinovich said.“We assess every day what the hourly prices are and if it's above or below breakeven, then we make a decision whether to switch on or off,” Kjetil Pettersen, CEO of Norway-based Kryptovault, told CoinDesk on Tuesday. “At this moment, our miners are shut off.” Kryptovault relocated to the north of the country earlier this year.Pettersen said he expects northern Norway power prices to come back down in the first quarter of 2023. Power prices across southern Europe, however, will stay high for 2023, he said.Miners will remain offline in Europe during the energy crisis as a means of self-preservation, Pettersen said. Whether they can survive without mining revenue depends on their reserve capital and ability to raise more funds, he said.Also pertinent: their level of debt.“If you need to reimburse capital, you cannot survive more than a couple of months because you need to repay the debt holders,” said Fiorenzo Manganiello, founder of UAE-based Cowa Energy, who also flagged Iceland as a viable option for mining.Unsustainable leverage has brought several miners in the U.S. to their knees. Large companies such as Core Scientific (CORZ) and Compute North have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Manganiello sees this as an opportunity to buy distressed assets.Mining sites are currently being sold at an 85%-90% discount, he said. During the bull market, miners were selling facilities, without mining machines, for $1.5 million per megawatt. Today, the figure is closer to $100,000 to $150,000 per MW, he said.Read more: Miners Take Off for The Great – and More Profitable – NorthCORRECTION (Dec. 22 16:35 UTC):  Removes reference to Cowa Energy being London-based.

49,"The Certified Financial Planner (CFP) Board dropped its “Notice to CFP Professionals Regarding Financial Advice about Cryptocurrency-related Assets” on Dec. 5.The board's notice is a 14-page report that outlines a series of risks associated with cryptocurrency investment. It lays out some standards that financial advisors can adhere to in their decision to provide, or not provide, advice on cryptocurrency investment.By the CFP Board’s definition, this advice includes “communications that, based on their content, context and presentation, would reasonably be viewed as a recommendation to take or refrain from taking a particular course of action.”You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.In short, the report elucidates the CFP Board’s “Code and Standards,” which neither prohibits advisors from giving advice on crypto nor inhibits them from not giving any advice on it. It emphasizes that financial advisors must adhere to Fiduciary Duty when giving advice on crypto by fully taking into account the goals, risk tolerances and personal/financial circumstances of the client. And it underscores the standards of competency necessary in giving crypto-related advice.The report does spell out, “The CFP Board’s Code and Standards does not require a CFP professional to offer Financial Advice to a Client on every Financial Asset that is available in the marketplace. A CFP professional does not violate the Code and Standards when the CFP professional does not provide Financial Advice about cryptocurrency-related assets.”However, the CFP Board’s precaution on advice giving should be interpreted to mean that crypto-uneducated financial advisors should not only avoid giving advice in support of cryptocurrency, but also giving advice in opposition to it.Financial advisors uneducated about crypto can no longer legitimately argue that cryptocurrencies are “Ponzi,” “beanie babies” or “tulips,” as all of those characterizations are not founded in facts or research. The statements might work over a beer with friends but not in financial planning with clients. In such settings, misrepresenting bitcoin is a form of advice – and there are far too many advisors currently in this camp.Read more: Worse Than Tulip Mania? Common Misconceptions About Crypto AssetsThe notice mentions, “A CFP professional must satisfy the Fiduciary Duty, which provides that a CFP professional must act as a fiduciary, and therefore, act in the client's best interests, at all times when providing Financial Advice to a Client.”This means that if you as a financial advisor feel it is irresponsible and not logical for your client to invest in crypto, then you should advise against it.That said, I have not seen a single advisor make a specific and compelling case against an allocation to bitcoin. Whereas mathematics favors adding bitcoin, FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) most often gets in the way.Bitcoin is not going to disappear because the FTX crypto exchange was allegedly a criminal enterprise. Bitcoin will remain around for generations to come because bitcoin is money, helps small business owners and helps solves ESG concerns.Not only that, information on how to more intelligently gain exposure to a variety of crypto assets is now available. The Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), created by CoinDesk Indices, provides reliable, comprehensive and standardized industry definitions and classifications for digital assets.Read more: Introducing CoinDesk Indices' Digital Asset Classification StandardIt is wholly and entirely up to each advisor to refrain from providing advice.But the report explains that “A CFP Professional Must Comply with the Duty of Competence When Providing Financial Advice About Cryptocurrency-Related Assets.”I don’t have an opinion on every esoteric investment strategy – and you don’t need to either. But it’s important that, as advisors, we be honest with clients when there is an area of investment that we are not fully educated on.Most advisors’ commentary on crypto should be, “I haven’t done the work to provide any analysis on it.” In my opinion, this applies to 90%+ of all advisors.That said, cryptocurrency has gone mainstream, so there is less and less room for excuses on why you haven’t spent time researching this growing asset class. CNBC even has bitcoin listed on its ticker tape – so clients of all ages are seeing it and hearing about it and they’re going to be asking you questions about it.I recommend that in 2023 you commit yourself to becoming more educated about cryptocurrency as a financial advisor. Fortunately, there are some great resources to do that.For books, I recommend reading ""The Bitcoin Standard,"" ""The Price of Tomorrow: Why Deflation Is the Key to an Abundant Future,"" ""The Bullish Case for Bitcoin"" and ""Inventing Bitcoin: The Technology Behind The First Truly Scarce and Decentralized Money Explained.""For podcasts, check out ""Bitcoin Fundamentals"" and ""Bitcoin Audible.""And finally, this blog post here is great: ""Gradually, Then Suddenly.""As an advisor, know there are peers out there that can and will help you learn. There will be and are advisors focused on gathering knowledge and helping clients navigate bitcoin.I’ve been fortunate to connect with other advisors and recently helped start the Bitcoin Financial Advisors Network. But be prepared. People at such events might ask hard questions and encourage you to dig deeper into preconceived notions.It’s time we as a financial industry hold ourselves to a higher standard when talking about bitcoin with clients, given that as a CFP you are allowed to discuss and recommend it.The key is getting educated because you are not protecting clients from bitcoin by not learning about it. Taking personal responsibility to educate yourself cannot be overstated in crypto. As they say, “Don’t Trust, Verify.”",2022/12/22
50,"The crypto market has recently held steady, with bitcoin locked in the narrow range of $16,000 to $18,000 amid lingering macroeconomic uncertainty and FTX contagion fears.The perplexing tranquility may soon fade because bitcoin's historical volatility hits levels last seen before the late 2020 bull run and investors with ample capital supply begin to accumulate coins.""The quiet price action of the past month is illustrated by [bitcoin's] low realized volatility. Not counting the moment leading up to the FTX fallout, which had slightly higher volatility than what we have now, this is the lowest level for realized volatility since the third quarter of 2020, just before the last bull run. Prior to that instance, volatility was this low at the bottom of the 2018 bear market,"" Blockware's weekly report said.""Calm waters do not last long in bitcoin, so be prepared for a sharp move here shortly,"" the report added.Realized volatility refers to the magnitude of daily price movements, irrespective of direction, over a specific period. It's a backward-looking metric, while the implied volatility is forward-looking, revealing options traders' expectations for price turbulence over the coming week/month.Bitcoin's annualized one-month realized volatility fell to a two-year low of 38% last week.""Investors should prepare for another swift move soon because smooth sailing does not endure in the crypto market for long,"" the Dec. 12 issue of Bitfinex's Alpha report said, referring to the ultra-low realized volatility.The report added that an uptick in implied volatility with an extended period of low realized volatility is followed by wild price fluctuations.At press time, short-term and long-term implied volatility metrics remain depressed in line with the realized volatility. The low implied volatility means the market is not forecasting a big move.The situation, however, could change after the holiday season, with traders snapping up options and pushing implied volatility higher relative to historical volatility.The renewed accumulation of BTC by whales, or investors with ample capital supply and the ability to move markets, is another reason to expect some action in the market.Large wallets have accumulated over 400,000 BTC ($6.73 billion) since the cryptocurrency fell below the June low of $18,000 on Nov. 9, Bitfinex report noted, quoting data from on-chain analytics platform Whalemap.The white line is bitcoin's daily close price (UTC), and the bubbles' size represents the number of coins accumulated by the whale wallets.""Over the past week, large or 'whale-styled' wallets have experienced an inflow of over 70,000 BTC. Around 120K BTC was accumulated at the $16,100 level, which offers potential support given the scale of buying,"" Bitfinex said.""At press time, bitcoin traded flat-to-positive near $16,900, according to CoinDesk data.",2022/12/22

""Over the past five years, all major price reversals in BTC have preceded those in major equity indices.""It shows bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, are looked upon by investors as more risky assets than stocks. As Brookings Institutions' Eswar Prasad noted last year, bitcoin has become a speculative investment.While corporate fundamentals and macroeconomic factors directly impact stocks, the crypto market is yet to develop strong links with the global economy. Digital assets, until now, have proved to be narrative-driven, with valuations almost entirely dependent on the pace of expansion in fiat currency supply, mainly the U.S. dollar and factors like inflation rate that influence the Federal Reserve policy.""The crypto market is one of the purest bets on global liquidity expansion and currency debasement. Not only is it influenced by macro factors, but when market conditions change, it’s often the first to react,"" Delphi's strategists noted.Bitcoin peaked at $69,000 on Nov. 11, 2021, or 55 days before the S&P 500 topped out at 4,818 on Jan. 4.

So why is there talk of banning it? asks Sam Reynolds.The heat is elsewhere as bitcoin hibernatesBy Brad KeounCryptocurrencies were barely budging in early Asia hours, even after a decent day of gains in U.S. stocks on Wednesday.The benchmark CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) of digital assets was down 0.3% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin was trading flat, just above $16,800.""Bitcoin isn't getting much of a boost from the positive risk-on environment that is running through Wall Street,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, wrote Wednesday in a note.The hot action was in the decentralized finance (DeFI) protocol Popsicle Finance's ICE token, which tripled over the past 24 hours after the controversial yet prolific blockchain developer Daniele Sestagalli said he was returning to the project after a hiatus.Crypto has yet to cause a fiat financial crisis. Why the talk of bans?By Sam ReynoldsWithout a doubt, the digital asset industry is in the depths of a market that looks a lot like 2008. One could even say that the elaborate DeFi protocols with questionable collateralization accelerated the market decline, in the same way that exotic derivative vehicles like collateralized debt obligations (CDO) made the 2008 crisis worse.But the damage is limited to crypto. There’s no evidence to suggest that some form of contagion has materialized that has spread over to the TradFi markets. Certainly, macroeconomic factors like interest rates and the strength of the dollar have impacted crypto, but so far this is a one-way street.The establishment sees it differently.In a recent speech, India's central bank Governor Shaktikanta Das forecasted that the next financial crisis would start with crypto and thus, it should be banned.""Our view is that it should be prohibited because if you try to regulate it and allow it to grow, please mark my words, the next financial crisis will come from private cryptocurrencies,"" CoinDesk reported Das as saying. ""They have no underlying value. They have huge inherent risks for our macro economic and financial stability. I [have] yet to hear any credible argument about what public good or what public purpose it serves.""Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the U.S. Senate Banking Committee chairman, made a similar argument during a recent appearance on the television news program ""Meet the Press"" but was able to (correctly) say that this would be difficult as it would simply force crypto to move entirely offshore.The financial crisis both are referring to is a loss of state control of money. This was also a theme in the white paper for China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC).While India has liberalized capital controls in recent years, they still exist. It maintains strict control over the nation’s money supply under the auspices of fighting inflation – which could be lethal for an emerging market with a large percentage of low earners.The U.S. doesn’t like crypto because it's a headache for its hegemonic ambitions. In a world that largely trades in dollars, U.S. control over the money supply means it can prosecute crimes when there is only a marginal connection to the country (see: Huawei, and BitMex).For lawmakers in both countries, it would be easier if crypto just ""went away."" Even after a year where there was a trifecta of calamity — Terra, Three Arrows Capital and FTX — bitcoin is still at $16,800, and the broader crypto market cap is just north of $800 billion.Crypto has weathered the storm that macroeconomic events and black swans brought upon it. Although it continues to be in the crosshairs of regulators, its problems have yet to cross the chasm into traditional finance (TradFi).

54,"The situation is “much closer to Hertz and Ford and Delta than FTX,” Core Scientific (CORZ) Chief Mining Officer Russell Cann told CoinDesk, explaining that he expects the company will emerge stronger from the reorganization process.Operating its own bitcoin (BTC) mining rigs and serving as a host for others, Core Scientific accounts for about 10% of the entire hashrate of the Bitcoin network, with computing power of nearly 25 exahash/second (EH/s). According to its Twitter, Core Scientific mines about 50 bitcoin per day for itself, and its most recent monthly update shows 1,295 bitcoin mined in October.Coming after months of turmoil for the crypto mining industry, which has been squeezed between low prices hurting revenue and higher energy costs lifting expenses, Wednesday’s Chapter 11 filing wasn’t a surprise. CORZ shares had already lost about 99% of their value over the past year, and the company had warned of a possible bankruptcy two months ago.Cann told CoinDesk that, operationally, it’s business as usual at the company, but the bankruptcy filing will now allow for “the restructure of the balance sheet.”Read more: Bitcoin Miner Core Scientific Files for Bankruptcy, Expects Support From Some Debt HoldersMost of Core Scientific’s customers that already have machines or contracts with the company’s hosting business won’t be affected by the bankruptcy, said Cann. The company, however, is considering selling two of its facilities, said Cann, but that was under consideration before the bankruptcy. The two sites are still under development and house none of their own machines, nor do they pertain to any existing hosting contracts, he said.Core Scientific has no plans to sell mining machines, unless in the normal course of business.As for Celsius Mining – Core Scientific’s largest hosting client and also going through a Chapter 11 restructuring with its parent, Celsius Network – Cann said the bankruptcy courts might get involved in their ongoing disagreement.Celsius Mining has claimed that Core Scientific violated the terms of bankruptcy by failing to host some of its machines and trying to pass through increased electricity costs. Core Scientific, meanwhile, has been routinely passing on increased energy charges to its hosting clients.The two sites that Core Scientific might be selling are in Muskogee, Oklahoma, and Barstow, Texas, that had been hoped to be operational in 2023, said Cann. “If anyone wants to turn on machines in 2023, their best shot is a site that Core has been working on for 18 to 24 months,” he said.Read more: A Huge Glut of Bitcoin Mining Rigs Is Sitting Unused in BoxesCore Scientific is in a prearranged bankruptcy, as opposed to a prepackaged or a free fall process, the chief mining officer said. That means that the company has agreement from a majority of debt holders, but not all. Bankruptcy courts can sometimes be used to force those that are holdouts to comply with the plan.One of the company’s largest unsecured creditors is investment bank B. Riley (RILY) – which earlier this week published a curious letter proposing a debt restructuring deal for Core Scientific. B. Riley is working closely with the miner, Cann said. The investment bank’s proposal required that all the equipment lenders had to agree to the plan, he added. “Since we're sitting here today, obviously, all the equipment lenders didn't agree,” Cann said.B. Riley shares are lower by 8.6% on Wednesday despite a rising stock market.According to the restructuring plan, the secured debt convertible noteholders will get equity. The current equity and unsecured holders will get warrants such that as the company grows they will get more shares, Cann explained.The plan also involves about $75 million in debtor-in-possession credit facilities. In its letter, B. Riley estimated that $72 million would give Core Scientific two years of runway.“One can argue there is no major impact on the industry – Bitcoin network continues to operate [...] and new blocks are created every 10 minutes,” said Juri Bulovic, head of mining at mining company Foundry. The bankruptcy, he said, is a good reminder of the volatility of the market.Foundry and CoinDesk share the same parent, Digital Currency Group.Foundry CEO Mike Colyer said he “has no doubt that Core's team will manage to navigate this difficult time and come out of it stronger.”At the same time, Colyer warned that “if you are caught taking on more risk at the wrong or unfortunate point in the bitcoin cycle, you may get wiped out – no matter how big or small you are, or how seasoned and experienced your team is.”“Taking leverage to hodl isn’t a great idea in bitcoin mining, which seems so obvious but also shows how easy one can be blinded during the bull market,” said Wolfie Zhao, head of research at TheMinerMag, the data and research arm of mining consultancy BlocksBridge.The bankruptcy filing might also send the share price of miners on a renewed downward trend. “This will be the first Chapter 11 of a publicly listed mining company, likely triggering a market wide sell off as investors derisk their portfolio by moving out of mining equities,” said Ethan Vera, chief operations officer at mining services firm Luxor.The situation “will make lenders, especially TradFi [traditional finance] ones, rethink how they evaluate the credit of mining companies from treasury strategy perspective when negotiating loan deals in the future,” Zhao said.",2022/12/21

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH): The largest cryptocurrency by market value looked remarkably stable Wednesday, trading around $16,780 and almost flat in the past 24 hours as traders wrestled with the uncertain market outlook for next year. ETH followed BTC’s trajectory, down 0.3% around $1,209. U.S. equities were a bit more buoyant: The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 1.5%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.4%.Waves (WAVES): The native token of decentralized blockchain dropped 5% to $1.51 on Wednesday and plunged by more than 40% over the past two weeks as Waves' founder Sasha Ivanov has asked crypto exchanges to deactivate futures markets tied to the WAVES token. The coin's slump has been attributed to the volatility of USDN, an algorithmic stablecoin that is designed to be pegged 1:1 with the U.S. dollar. The stablecoin is backed by the WAVES token and has de-pegged on multiple occasions this year.dYdX (DYDX): The token price dropped over 14% to $1.18 as many investors are “front-running a huge supply unlock that begins in February,” Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, wrote in a Wednesday note.By Glenn Williams Jr.Momentum for both BTC and ETH remains in neutral territory, using the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) as a proxy for momentum. BTC’s current RSI is approximately 49.06 – a very middling level. RSI is a technical indicator that ranges from 1 to 100. Readings over 70 imply that an asset is potentially overbought, while readings under 30 imply that an asset is possibly oversold.Searching BTC data back to 2015, and filtering for RSI levels between 49 and 50 shows 61 occurrences with an average gain of 2.2%, 30 days after the fact. For ETH, filtering for RSI levels between 47 and 49, showed 43 occurrences since 2017, with an average 30-day gain of 6.7%.Applying those performance figures to current prices, results in prices of $17,144 for bitcoin and $1,291 for ether.

56,"If there’s one big thing that the mainstream coverage has missed about the various collapses in the crypto space over the past year, it’s this:The downfall of crypto had very little to do with crypto.David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist. This article is part of Crypto 2023.Cryptocurrency is the application of blockchain technology to build uncensorable, open-access and immutable global shared ledgers – usually monetary ledgers. But the headline crimes and failures of 2023 were almost uniformly attempts to use financial engineering to turn the future value of those systems into present-day U.S. dollars.Too often, the finance bros bet big, using the same kind of fragile, nested and interlocking leverage that led to the 2008 financial crisis. Other times they used outright fraud – and they did it off-chain, playing by no rules, with no transparency. They were mistaken for part of the cryptocurrency industry, but it would have been more accurate to think of them as hangers-on and freeloaders, redirecting genuine public interest in crypto to their various unsustainable games.As in much of contemporary finance, the finance bros were extractive rather than additive. They were not builders, but instead a swarm of hatchling vampire squid, little would-be Goldmans frantically shoving their underdeveloped blood-funnels into anything that smelled like money.The epic failures of these finance vampires, plus broader economic conditions, mean that 2023 in the crypto world will be a much different year than 2021 or 2022. Hedge fund gamblers and token-shilling hype men will be relegated to supporting roles, where they belong, as the shadowy super-coders who actually make crypto exist move back into the spotlight.See also: Money Crypto Versus Tech Crypto | OpinionBut 2023 will also be different from previous “BUIDL eras,” during which huge squads of nerds were often set free to pursue whatever seemed cool to them. There will certainly still be some of that, but smart leaders will be pushing their teams much more firmly towards clearer goals: Building accessible and reliable front ends, for use cases with real-world demand, then (hopefully) generating revenue from users. The broad public now has a vague idea of what crypto is (for better or worse). The task now is finding out how to sell it as a tool rather than a speculative investment.This will mean, among other things, less speculation on new tokens, particularly the tokens for new “layer 1” blockchains. In its place will be a relative increase in attention to services that leverage existing, trusted chains and ecosystems to build services with real demand that genuinely require the benefits of blockchains – cross-border fluidity, digital permanence, uncensorability and decentralized governance.This future, of course, assumes that the finance bros have been sufficiently embarrassed to feel some vague sense of humility, and that their marks have wised up a bit. Personally, I don’t think that task is quite accomplished. Like unruly dogs beholden to their animal spirits, institutional traders and speculators may still need their noses rubbed into the mess they’ve made. So, let’s do that.Across many sectors of the economy, the 21st century role of finance has become catastrophically perverted. Rather than risking capital to generate long-term profit by building productive industries, the capital game has become about timing bubbles and picking narratives that will trick naïve investors (retail or otherwise) into becoming bag carriers. Meanwhile you, the pumper, head off to the White Lotus with the cash.This isn’t a problem specific to crypto – especially not over the past three years. The litany of overbought, undercooked and sometimes just plain rotten companies rolls off the tongue: Clover Health (a 2020 Chamath SPAC joint on the verge of delisting), Meta Platforms (rebranded around an app with no users), Nikola (an electric vehicle fraud that raised $3.2 billion), Tesla (once pumped, now dumped), Theranos ($700 million in venture capital, another fraud).The villains of the 2022 crypto collapse were, with one exception, born and bred in this darkness. They saw little more in crypto than the prospect of good hunting. Su Zhu and Kyle Davies started Three Arrows Capital to trade foreign currencies before transitioning to crypto. Sam Bankman-Fried infamously came to crypto from technical trading at Jane Street. Steve Ehrlich of Voyager Digital formerly helped run E-Trade. Alex Mashinsky was steeped in Silicon Valley tech VC and its accompanying blather. The one exception is Terra creator Do Kwon, who did build a crypto network – but did it on the shifting sands of venture capital, leverage and concealed risk.The carpetbaggers saw crypto as the next hot thing, but they clearly never understood it. Above all, they didn’t understand that good cryptos are public networks and generate returns through vastly different mechanisms than corporations. This was most clear with lending platforms including Celsius Network, Voyager and Terra’s Anchor protocol, which offered high and fairly fixed rates of return on assets that didn’t generate revenue, leading inexorably to illiquidity and collapse.A large element driving this mega-screwup was a decade of low interest rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve to drive investment. With historically safe and predictable financial options like Treasury bonds returning next to nothing, capital was pushed to the far ends of the risk curve – much of it ending up in crypto. Then, against this macroeconomic backdrop, fiscal policy was loosened to keep the economy afloat at beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excess cash found its way into bitcoin and other cryptos, which in turn found its way into emerging sub-sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). Thus “DeFi Summer” was primed.Some of blockchain’s johnny-come-latelies saw the early bubble in DeFi tokens, driven by the introduction of “yield farming,” and thought that was an enduring part of “crypto” writ large. The numbers and the jargon must have been intoxicating to them at first blush. In reality, of course, DeFi Summer was a one-time event that minted millionaires among knowledgeable insiders who navigated a minefield of smaller frauds and hacks. Durable DeFi platforms were in the end uniquely bad for the leverage gamblers, since on-chain returns are restrained by actual demand for loans – a restraint enforced by public code.This is why, while Terra and its Anchor protocol looked like DeFi, they were in fact a sham – the sky-high returns promised through deposits in Anchor were coming not from system use, but from venture capitalists and other very finite outside sources. Dragonfly’s Haseeb Qureshi goes as far as calling yield farming an expensive “customer acquisition strategy,” where rates were paid out by marketing budgets. This month provided a poetic bookend to contrast that with stable DeFi systems: While Terra blew up while offering yield as high as 20%, MakerDAO recently reactivated 1% yield as demand for its products grew. One of those systems still exists as a going concern, and the other does not.The use of VC funding to replace a functional business model is straight out of the Silicon Valley Venture Bubble playbook. Championed above all by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, the game is to subsidize user adoption then apply those “growth” figures to predict future *unsubsidized* use, attracting further investment, which is spent to subsidize more adoption.See also: FTX Showed the Problems of Centralized Finance. Note DeFi | OpinionEssentially, capital becomes a cudgel to eliminate enemies – including those with better-run businesses or superior technology – and build monopolies. While Thiel framed his game plan as a way to starve out the competition, the approach could also be considered a form of finance-driven deception.But reality is reasserting itself: Uber, founded 15 years ago, is still above all an elaborate mechanism for setting money on fire. Facebook (now Meta), the investment that made Thiel’s name, was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year. But early investors in Facebook or Uber certainly don’t care: They’ve already cashed in. This love ‘em and leave ‘em financial philandering becomes even more insidious when tokens are involved, because VCs can dump their bags on the public pretty much whenever they want.So from Silicon Valley to Wall Street, a long-term grift is being exposed. The continued rise in U.S. interest rates will peel away more strips of overcapitalized fat until, in many cases, there’s nothing left.To be clear, I’m not calling for a purge of either venture capital or hedge fund-style speculation. There are good-faith funders in the space who are genuinely interested in building big new businesses over the course of years, not just grabbing the money and running. The crypto industry has for years relied on small-time traders to provide liquidity and rigor, and they will always have a seat at the table.Unfortunately, the good funders and hard-nosed traders have been overshadowed by con artists we mistook for business people. Even more to the point, the 2020-2021 bull market distorted the natural order of things by making the finance bros the stars of the show instead of the supporting players they are meant to be. They built castles in the sky, funneling the life savings of naïve retail speculators into tokens from fundamentally flawed projects and collecting fat fees for the effort.This exemplifies the tragic curse of the financier as a species: If you only understand numbers but not where they come from, you don’t understand anything at all.And so, thoroughly spooked by crypto, institutions and hedge funds will take their ball and go home for much of 2023. Amateur day traders hoping to make life-changing money off the efforts of others will, hopefully, decide to do something more productive with their energies (and they’ll be better off for it). There will be less money to go around for developers: teams will have to go lean, and many projects (including more than a few good ones) will evaporate.See also: Andrew Keys – 10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023 | OpinionBut again, in the big picture, this is largely for the best. Crypto still has limited capacity to responsibly absorb capital: contra Peter Thiel, you can’t simply spend your way to adoption of something so novel and complex. Actual developers working on crypto projects are still in the low thousands.But for the next two years at least, smaller funders, more firmly rooted in the ideals and technology of crypto, will be in pole position on good deals and ideas. They’ll do what financiers are actually meant to do – not farm hype and magazine covers for themselves, but help the actual builders do their jobs.",2022/12/21
57,"Bitcoin and ether continue to trade flat, as volatility for the two assets wanes.Bitcoin (BTC) prices stabilized following the FTX fallout, now off a mere 2% from Nov. 11. The ether price (ETH) is down a more pronounced 6% from the same date.The most recent six months of trading activity for BTC has followed a familiar, if not exhausting pattern.Number 3 is where we are now.Predicting the length of time that crypto assets will remain range-bound is challenging, if not foolhardy. There are some cues to pay attention to, however.Momentum for both BTC and ETH remains in neutral territory, using the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) as a proxy for momentum. BTC’s current RSI is approximately 49.06 – a very middling level. RSI is a technical indicator that ranges from 1-100. Readings over 70 imply that an asset is potentially overbought, while readings under 30 imply that an asset is possibly oversold.Searching BTC data back to 2015, and filtering for RSI levels between 49 and 50 shows 61 occurrences with an average gain of 2.2%, 30 days after the fact.For ETH, filtering for RSI levels between 47 and 49, showed 43 occurrences since 2017, with an average 30-day gain of 6.7%.Applying those performance figures to current prices, results in prices of $17,144 for bitcoin and $1,291 for ether. This is far from earth-shattering, given where both have traded in the past.The results should not be viewed as predictive but can provide context as to where investors think prices may wind up.If using the historic data for guidance, it’s difficult to find a bullish scenario in the short term. Both price points fall within areas of significant price agreement, decreasing the likelihood of prices pushing higher without an external catalyst.Current data doesn’t offer much either. Both BTC and ETH are both showing declines in volatility because the Average True Range of their price movements has fallen 47% and 46% since November.Their respective Bollinger Bands lend additional credence, as BTC and ETH have stayed closely tethered to their 20-day moving averages, straying from the mean only briefly, before reverting back.As a counterpoint, there isn’t much of a bearish case to be made either.The appetite of asset managers has picked up, adding to their long positions in bitcoin for three consecutive weeks.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Commitment of Traders report is a weekly listing the open interest for futures and options.The most recent release shows that asset managers now account for 40% of long open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and are reportedly 83% long as a group.Derivatives markets show a decline in the ratio of bitcoin put options to call options. One interpretation is that investors see declining opportunities to be profitable by betting against crypto.Ultimately, it likely boils down to investor time horizon.If long-term biased, the current market structure likely provides you with a solid entry point. Shorter-term traders however may be turned off by the lack of price movement.",2022/12/21
58,"Bitcoin looked remarkably stable Wednesday, trading around $16,780 as traders wrestled with the uncertain market outlook for next year.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been moving sideways at the range between $16,700 and $16,900 in the past 24 hours.“Bitcoin isn't getting much of a boost from the positive risk-on environment that is running through Wall Street,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange Oanda, wrote in a Wednesday note.Ether (ETH) followed a similar trajectory, trading flat at $1,210. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was down 0.16%.U.S. equities were a bit more buoyant on Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was recently trading up 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.4%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.4%.Traders have been navigating the continuing nervousness on the potential market contagion from the FTX collapse over the past month and closely watching the U.S. Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance on possibly continuing to raise interest rates in 2023.“The probability of a recession is high,” crypto trader Thomas Kralow previously said in an emailed comment. “People lose their jobs, the Fed pivots too late and we will see the same situation that played out back in 2008. When the Fed pivoted there was a relief rally for S&P 500, but as the interest rates finally started going down the market crashed another 40%.”Kralow pointed out that the markets bottomed when the fed funds rate was basically at zero, adding: “This doesn’t bode well for bitcoin in 2023, and we could potentially see its price fall to $10,000 or even lower next year.”To Alex Tapscott, managing director of the digital asset group at Ninepoint Partners, the current market environment is similar to December 2018 when bitcoin (BTC) hit a then-all-time high in the winter of 2017, and 2018 began “a long period of contraction” in terms of the value among crypto assets.Tapscott told CoinDesk in an interview that the bitcoin drawdown from its all-time high in November 2021 is around 77%, compared to previous bear market lows of 84%, which could suggest further downside.“But we are kind of in that sweet spot where it's starting to look a lot like previous eras,” he said.“You could try and pick a bottom and set yourself up for what I think is going to be a really strong period of growth,"" he added. “But you might not get rewarded for being early because it might retest the same level a couple more times.”",2022/12/21
59,"Recent bankruptcy filings and Sam Bankman-Fried's criminal indictment make it clear that fraud precipitated FTX's collapse. For many policymakers, the loopholes enabling such criminal acts haven't yet become clear. These loopholes permitted flawed – or in FTX’s case, criminal – intermediaries to stand between consumers and their assets. If the U.S. Congress is serious about preventing future catastrophes like FTX, protecting consumers’ inherent right to self-custody clearly mitigates third-party vulnerabilities.Warren Davidson is the U.S. representative for Ohio's 8th congressional district.Just what and who needs legal protection? While Satoshi Nakamoto’s 2008 Bitcoin white paper effectively launched this era of fintech innovation, the legal and regulatory framework today continues to reinforce the structure of our traditional financial system and the legacy flaws that come with it. Fraud is one of these legacy flaws. Fraud committed under the guise of ""innovation"" is still fraud. FTX exemplified this.In short, Bankman-Fried found a way to convince customers and investors to allocate dollars to FTX's platform (or, rather, FTX's balance sheet) by promising to be a third-party intermediary to purchase digital assets on their behalf. Customers then maintained ""balances"" in their FTX accounts while Bankman-Fried put funds under the control of Alameda Research, the trading firm he founded in 2017. He established his own cryptocurrency, FTT, to use as collateral for any loans made from FTX to Alameda. He then leveraged his assets under Alameda's control at unprecedented levels.While this overview spares many details, this is the same criminal approach that has been seen before in traditional finance. FTX customers who transferred their digital assets off FTX's platform and onto their own self-hosted wallets – devices that allow digital assets to be stored off the internet – protected themselves from FTX's fraud. This approach provides the only sound protection against any third-party intermediary’s failure.Read more: Marta Belcher - Elizabeth Warren's New Financial Surveillance Bill Is a Disaster for Privacy and Civil LibertiesFTX leveraged the hype around distributed ledger technology but, ironically, FTX promoted the exact opposite framework that Satoshi proposed. Reading the first two sentences of the Bitcoin white paper highlights this irony: ""Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust-based model."" FTX simply exploited the inherent flaws in the permissioned, third-party financial system Satoshi observed and sought to remedy.Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) recently introduced a bill to build a concrete enclosure around these trust-based models while trapping consumers inside with no way out. Specifically, her bill requires the Treasury Secretary to promulgate a rule prohibiting financial institutions from transacting with self-hosted wallets. She mischaracterizes the FTX situation and claims she's been ""ringing the alarm bell in the Senate on the dangers of these digital asset loopholes.""Let's be clear – her open hostility towards financial freedom is a clear and present danger to consumers and will only reinforce the system fraudsters continue to exploit.That's why I introduced the Keep Your Coins Act last February. It was only a matter of time before someone in Washington, D.C., would try to compel the Treasury Department to interfere with consumers' inherent right to self-custody of their digital assets – to own and possess private property. In the wake of FTX's collapse, it should be evident that protecting self-custody is must-pass legislation.In his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, John J. Ray III, the current FTX CEO overseeing the bankruptcy process, discussed how all of FTX customers' digital assets were commingled. This model left customers with only a ""claim"" over their assets rather than actual possession.We have a technology that allows consumers to avoid third-party vulnerabilities. It's imperative to embrace this opportunity to protect consumers. FTX was not about crypto; it was about a criminal exploiting a traditional third-party relationship by failing to do what he said he was doing – establishing a property right to digital assets on behalf of customers who deposited funds with his company. Self-custody has proved the only foil to his scheme, and Congress should protect it rather than undermine it with Senator Warren’s disingenuous assault on financial freedom.",2022/12/21

61,"Bitcoiner and podcaster Peter McCormack should pay Craig Wright, the Australian scientist who claims to be Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, around 900,000 British pounds (US$1.1 million) in costs following their legal battle, U.K. High Court Judge Martin Chamberlain has ruled.Wright had argued that McCormack should pay the majority of costs for the legal proceedings, but accepted paying all McCormack's costs save for those ruled in Wright's favor.The costs ruled in Wright's favor relate to an earlier judgment from October last year, finding that McCormack could not prove that he was telling the truth when he labeled the Wright a fraud.The two men's legal battle emanated from a 2019 discussion – subsequently broadcast on YouTube – in which McCormack called Wright a liar and a fraud and said he ""is not Satoshi."" Wright claimed that such comments caused him financial damage after he was disinvited to speak at various events and conferences.The judge concluded in August that Wright had advanced false evidence in his claim, and therefore awarded him only nominal damages of one pound ($1.23). In his final judgment, Chamberlain refused Wright's permission to appeal this decision.The judge also did not grant Wright's request for an injunction to be made against McCormack repeating these claims.Craig Wright has been involved in a string of legal battles surrounding his claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, of whom nobody knows the true identity.

62,"Financial institutions are starting to realize they should have been embracing decentralized finance (DeFi) all along. By the end of 2023 the largest DeFi ecosystems will be the most demonstrably decentralized ones.Although decentralization is the bedrock on which all blockchain technologies are built, it is hardly a guarantee across crypto. The recent boom-bust market cycle was marked by the rise of two competing approaches among crypto finance ventures: censorship-resistance versus speed.Kevin Mehrabi is the CEO of Wealthchain. This article is part of Crypto 2023.In recent years, the few financial institutions brave enough to enter crypto have generally preferred centralized entities to invest in. These are firms that offered the veneer of transparency and were run by people with reputations to lose.In 2023, after the disastrous reckoning across the crypto industry, we will finally see their massive shift of institutional interest towards genuinely trustless protocols.The decentralization-first crowd begins their platforms on a smart-contract level – deploying permissionless applications onto a blockchain. Although protocols like Compound, Aave and Uniswap have development entities, they are protocols first and foremost. They eschew custodial wallets and off-chain collateral, ensuring that the flow of funds is observable on a public block record.See also: Adoption of DeFi, ZK Tech, NFTs and More Will Continue to Increase in 2023Decentralization advocates view centralized ventures as everything wrong with traditional finance. Of course, layering centralization across blockchains would lead to the same problems that inspired Satoshi Nakamoto to build Bitcoin. DeFi in its truest sense is the completion of this decentralization-first purist approach.Centralization-first industrialists have historically paid lip service to crypto’s main tenets of openness, verifiability and irreversibility all while saying central intermediaries would have to come into play at some point. They dismissed the decentralization-first approach as unsustainable idealism from tone-deaf techie folk. And, truth enough, FTX, Celsius Network, Nexo, BlockFi and Voyager Digital did scale rapidly. But greater speed and more feature capability comes with risks.The events of 2022 demonstrated that centralization-first approaches to crypto finance present the greater risk. Indeed, the unmonitored control of off-chain capital by FTX and Celsius enabled the misdeeds and bad trades that led to their catastrophic collapse. Meanwhile, the transparency and security of the decentralization-first set including Aave, Compound, Sushi and dYdX have left those DeFi platforms virtually unscathed. In fact, Uniswap recently surpassed Coinbase in trading volume for the first time to become the world’s second-largest exchange.Critics will point to historical DeFi hacks as evidence that DeFi is not as secure as decentralization-first purists would describe. However, those exploits are not indicative of the whole. Rather, many exploits this year were due to the rush of untested platforms released into the wild, and security auditors being overwhelmed by demand that outpaced their ability to maintain quality. When built, reviewed and governed properly, DeFi platforms can be as secure as the blockchains on which they were deployed.Likewise, the degree of decentralization among the underlying blockchains themselves will become a subject of increasing importance to DeFi in 2023. Poorly decentralized blockchain governance can and has led to contentious hard forks in which the blockchain community, network and most importantly every digital asset issued on that chain suffer a “split.”Without decentralized governance, dissent can only lead to division. The outcomes of these events are unpredictable: Each respective faction claims to be the authentic continuance of the previously united chain. One faction could rally the network and become dominant – but that dominance can change over time. The uncertainty itself is the problem.Asset-split risk is an underdiscussed problem for DeFi – with potentially calamitous repercussions. Ethereum saw a contentious chain split after its recent hard fork (the Merge), for which JPMorgan expressed concerns a rival proof-of-work-run Ethereum could cause market confusion and split the network. That didn’t happen this time, but that’s because nearly everyone building on Ethereum supported an upgrade to proof-of-stake – not every decision will be as black and white going forward.See also: Where Is the Ethereum Virtual Machine Headed in 2023? (Hint: Beyond Ethereum)Imagine if Tether’s USDT reserves suddenly had to collateralize assets for not just one set of tokens on Ethereum but two after a contentious chain split. For financial institutions evaluating the prospect of tokenizing trillions of dollars in capital and quadrillions of dollars in derivatives, even a low prospect for asset-splitting becomes untenable.So, how will financial institutions embrace DeFi while minimizing asset-split risk? The simple solution is through diversification to many different DeFi ecosystems. “The future is multi-chain,” after all. An additional safeguard is to engage with DeFi ecosystems on blockchains that are the least likely to suffer asset splits – that is, blockchains with the most decentralized forms of governance.How can blockchain protocol governance be decentralized? Blockchains such as Algorand enable validators to vote on upgrade proposals. Tezos, a network I have a stake in seeing succeed, put as many governance decisions on-chain. Thus far, Tezos has had 12 successful upgrades since its 2018 launch, with all contentions resolved on-chain.As financial institutions increasingly engage DeFi over the course of 2023, the scope of standards for decentralization will extend to governance at all levels. It would behoove DeFi platforms and the blockchain communities on which they are built to take heed.",2022/12/21
63,"We have recently been reminded that markets, as heavily as we rely on them, are far from ideal in practice. For one thing, settlement risk of major equities markets is increasingly capable of taking down the global economy. This is because of the growing number of traders occasionally using social media to in effect collude, such as with GameStop.For another, cryptocurrency marketplaces such as FTX have caused huge losses to users because of the lack of full custody coverage. These issues stem from the way current electronic markets were simply designed as copies of open outcry and paper-based markets – and, also, ironically, from the fact that all the major crypto markets were built in an unprecedentedly centralized manner.Even a commitment to full coverage is, of course, not enough to address custody risk – those running an exchange can easily abscond with its assets. And even if both settlement and custody risk are solved, information asymmetry remains a problem. Access to tremendously valuable information about trades and traders is available exclusively to those who operate all types of markets today. Somewhat akin to consumer data in Web2 versus Web3, this data has huge potential for a variety of clandestine market manipulations. There is currently no way to prove the negative, that such information is not being exploited to the detriment of traders and markets overall.David Chaum, a pioneer in cryptography and in privacy preserving and secure voting technologies, is the creator and founder of the xx network. In 1995 his company, DigiCash, created and deployed eCash, the first digital currency, which used Chaum's breakthrough blind-signature protocol. This essay is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.A market mechanism I’ll introduce below solves these problems. It has no custody risk or settlement risk, and trader information is available only to the respective traders themselves.The underlying type of market here is generally referred to as a “call market.” Such periodic auction markets are, for instance, used today in Nasdaq’s opening and closing periods. Traders place what should be sealed transaction requests during these trading periods. Only after the period ends are the requests, in effect, unsealed, a single price calculated from the requests and the trades that should clear at that price consummated.To keep trader information from the exchange operator in the solution here, the market clearing price is calculated by a so-called multiparty computation (MPC). This term was coined by me to describe what are now increasingly often-deployed cryptographic techniques. These allow multiple encrypted inputs to be converted to a cleartext output by an agreed algorithm. The “computation” is in effect performed by the cryptographic protocol itself such that no party can decrypt the encrypted inputs posted, but all parties can be certain that the cleartext output was computed correctly from exactly those inputs.Although most equities and traditional commodities today are not primarily represented on blockchains, a few are, such as by the Swiss exchange Sixth. In this system, however, to address settlement and custody risk all assets traded are held on blockchains. For instance, when the pair being traded is bitcoin against dollars, bitcoin is, of course, already on a blockchain and dollars would be on a dollar stablecoin blockchain. As part of the process of submitting a bid or ask, the asset is transferred to a wallet on the native blockchain of that asset. But such wallets are created to be under joint custody of the exchange and the trader – so-called “multisig” wallets. Their value can only be transferred out by cooperation of those two entities.Read more: 10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023Once the multiparty computation reveals the market clearing price as mentioned above, some of the multisig wallets will trade and the rest will be refunded. Bids above the clearing price, as well as asks below the clearing price, trade at the clearing price in a typical call market; non-traded bids and asks result in the assets in the associated multisig wallet being refunded to the trader who placed them there. Such refunds are easy to achieve: The exchange operator simply reveals its keys for all multisigs for which a zero-knowledge proof, provided by a given trader, shows that the particular price that was cryptographically committed to by that trader does not make the cutoff. (To ensure that the numbers of buyers and sellers that will trade are equal, different cutoffs can be provided for buy- and sell-side.) The keys issued by the exchange are useless to anyone except the trader in question, who then uses them to regain control of the asset they committed.A simple way to accomplish the swap of those assets remaining locked in the multisig wallets is based on fixed lots on one side of the asset pair: for instance, one bitcoin against a variable number of dollars. (Larger trades could be made more efficient by multiple parallel markets, each for fixed lots such as two, four, eight and 16 bitcoin, but using the same clearing price; however, I’ll ignore this elaboration in what follows.) An amount of value initially moved to the multisig wallets on the variable-amount side by traders functions as a minimum “commitment fee.” Once the clearing price is established by MPC, traders on the variable-amount side transfer additional value to their respective multisig wallets so as to fund the exact amount required by the swap.Finally, the MPC randomly pairs off all remaining counterparties, each pair comprising one trader on the bid side and one on the ask side. This then allows each pair to bilaterally complete an “atomic swap” protocol, in which settlement occurs directly as part of the trade. Such a swap is the only way the parties can unlock the value they placed in the multisig wallet. As I noted earlier, it results in the party on one side of the trade taking custody of what was the multisig wallet of their counterparty on the other side of the trade. What I’ve called “Liquifinity” is an atomic-swap technology that cryptographically secures against either party walking away before they give their counterparty the keys for the multisig to be transferred and thereby complete the swap. So parties that placed a bid for a price above the clearing price consummate a trade with randomly-selected counterparties that committed to an ask below the clearing price. No third party ever has custody, meaning no custody risk. And the trade is “atomic” – settlement coincident with the trade – meaning no settlement risk.See also: Crypto 2023: It's Sanctions Season | OpinionIf, however, those operating the exchange could learn who is associated with specific bids or asks, this information could allow them to manipulate the market, such as by learning the approximate positions and trading patterns of participants. To solve this, what I’ve called “mixing” is used for all communication between traders and the exchange. Mixing conceals who is sending or receiving which message. Moreover, trader identities should not be associated with wallet IDs of the underlying assets being traded. Unlinking, in this way, any persistent user identity from trades hides who is behind transactions, which can be a useful source of information to anyone aiming to manipulate a market.Collusion between an exchange and traders, or even potential extortion of traders by an exchange, however unthinkable in many settings, can be ensured against by a bond posted by the exchange. The bond need only be sufficient for the exposure of a single round of a call market, because such abuse would come to light before a next round. This makes the maximum backing of such exchanges extremely practical. It is in sharp contrast to what would be impractical bonding requirements for typical settlement or even for exchange arrangements with extended periods over which risks can accumulate.This is a fully generalizable way to realize a market for pairs of assets. It includes a solution to both custody and settlement risk. And it obviates manipulation through information asymmetry by ensuring that all details remain private to traders. It is immediately applicable to crypto markets, where the need is most urgent and acutely felt. Once deployed, it will demonstrate that traditional markets can benefit significantly from adopting such best practices from crypto.",2022/12/21
64,"“Quantity has a quality all its own.”—Thomas A. Callaghan Jr.Although the ethical and legal dimensions of the FTX meltdown will be subject to ongoing debate, this much is clear in the wake of the biggest value destruction event in the history of our industry. CeFi, or centralized finance, is fatally flawed and no longer has a defensible value proposition to stand on. Exchanges have already seen the retail sector slip out of reach due to simple unit economics. Amid the bull rush, Super Bowl commercials and namesake stadiums pushed CAC/LTV ratios [lifetime value divided by the customer acquisition cost] beyond the realm of reality. And then when the market tanked in May, the not-all-that-large-to-begin-with pool of retail interest dried up abruptly, to the point that taking it on the chin became the default expectation for the family Thanksgiving dinner.And now, after Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison, there will be no good reason for large, well-run banks to use CeFi exchanges either. Whether the former heads of FTX and Alameda Research were guilty of criminal greed or just incredulous levels of stupidity is irrelevant. CeFi will head off into the sunset, as it deservedly should. “Disintermediation as a service” is prone to corruption and waste. It’s a bad premise on which to build a business, let alone a category.Mike Maizels is the former head of research at Abra. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.As such, the next logical step for the industry is to turn its attention to where cryptocurrency potentials collide with the needs and frictions of legacy financial institutions. Decentralized finance (DeFi) may represent the financial “pipes” of the future, but it is the old world of traditional finance (TradFi) that still holds all the water. To date, adoption has been hindered by regulatory uncertainty, market volatility and the risks inherent in diving in to provable digital scarcity as an early entrant. But lying behind these immediate roadblocks, the way forward becomes somehow even less clear. Perhaps the most fundamental issue of all is sheer size. Consider the just market for foreign currency. JPMorgan settles forex trades with the combined value of the entire cryptocurrency sector every day.Blockchain technology has much value to bring to this market, particularly through the novel capabilities of stablecoins. Their potential for instant settlement and close-to-zero marginal costs – which could unlock dramatically lower foreign exchange (FX) rates – is tantalizingly real, but the infrastructure needed to support adoption at scale is critically missing.Scale matters because almost all present-day crypto settlement products were built under retail-sized premises. Namely, low marginal cost settlement has been made possible by the remarkable maturation of “automated market makers,” also known as AMMs. AMMs perform the work of legacy trading firms and banks, offering liquidity in the form of standings offers to buy and sell assets at specified prices – all without human intervention.The ability to do so without human input lies in an elegant use of simple mathematical principles to maintain balance in liquidity pools. Two assets, X and Y, are held in a pool, with the product of their cumulative values linked to some constant. For the purposes of a simple explanation, assume the assets are equivalent to each other in price. 100 X units and 100 Y units makes a pool constant of 10,000. Now imagine a trader wants to acquire 10 units of Y. That would leave 90 in the pool, a deficit of 11.1 X units (10,000/90 = 111.1). This becomes the price (plus a small fee) paid by the trader for her new 10 units of Y. Note that 10 units of Y for 11.1 units of X represents an 11.1% premium over the abstract, 1:1 price parity under which the pool was established.Read more: Preventing Crypto Exploits & Hacks in 2023 | OpinionImportantly, this slippage grows exponentially as the trade size approaches the limits of the pool depth. Imagine if the trader wanted to acquire 99 units of Y. The price paid would be 9,900 units of X, a premium of just under 1 million percent. In practice, these unit economics limit the institutional utility of even the largest DeFi pools – Uniswap currently supports a daily trading volume less than a tenth of a percent of JPMorgan’s foreign exchange business.Owing to such limitations, large institutions wishing to transact at scale have had no real choice other than to use custodial CeFi exchanges like FTX. Custodial here is key to the potential for abuse. Unlike traditional FX desks, which operate as deal-brokers but would rarely take custody of liquid assets, cryptocurrency exchanges take possession of the tokens in order to execute orders directly. This model, akin to permitting a real estate agent to move into your house and take possession of your deed as a precondition of sale, prepares the ground for disaster. Not only can exchanges front-run trades, profiting at the expense of clients, but the lack of deep liquidity makes it necessary to advertise large limit orders in a public manner. These limit orders may be anonymized to an extent, but even public awareness of the existence of large orders skews market intelligence to the detriment of all who seek to participate.Builders are hard at work creating solutions for this blockage across a spectrum of time horizons. In the most immediate term, regulated cryptocurrency service providers are beginning to stand up over-the-counter (OTC) desks along the models of currency exchanges of yesteryear – working the phones on behalf of clients rather than taking custody of their assets in order to execute trades on their behalf. This will no doubt drive value; it is a matter of seconds to move stablecoins on a blockchain rather than days to settle fiat exchange through SWIFT.See also: The Best Bitcoin Lightning Payment Solutions | OpinionHowever, the use of human brokers foregoes the signature advantage of DeFi: trustless, automated functioning. Uber would be a remarkably less-efficient company if human switchboard operators were required to match riders to drivers. Tech-driven systems such as on-chain order books suffer from the converse problem. Their trustless nature necessitates a publicly visible set of trading positions, a flaw akin to poker players betting with cards displayed to all of their opponents.However, a bottom-up approach to new tools to connect AMMs and to expand the kinds of instruments that they support (e.g., options with an expiration date) has the potential to push back the horizons of the possible. These topics have received important theoretical treatment by Dr. Maurice Herlihy, An Wang professor of computer science at Brown University, who has demonstrated that AMMs may be considered like electrical circuits. Properly constructed, they can operate either in series (trade asset A for B on one AMM, and B for C on another) or in parallel (split a large trade between A for B between multiple AMMs), arrangements that may be considered as mathematically equivalent to one larger AMM. Significantly, these different configurations can redistribute the costs of participating between traders (slippages, as described above) and capital providers (the much rehearsed impermanent loss). Such costs can never be fully eliminated, but they can be subjected both to rational minimization and strategic hedging (e.g., a synthetic “impermanent gain” token that offers insurance for impermanent loss).The analogy with the electrical circuit is extremely important. The modern discovery of electromagnetic phenomena occurred in the late 18th century, and it took decades for the rules governing their operation to be formulated mathematically. It took several additional decades for the discipline of “electrical engineering” to emerge, which sought to harness the principles of electricity to perform socially useful functions. The first product, the telegraph, enabled only the exchange of direct messages, akin to the first permissionless, peer-to-peer payments on the Bitcoin ledger. The modern electrical infrastructure required numerous other independent inventions to come online together – the dynamo for generation, the battery for storage, the resistor and capacitor for modulation. But soon, these and other devices permitted not just inventors, but entrepreneurs to create technological marvels that transformed the fabric of the world.Read more: 2023 Will Be the Year of Dapps – Here's What to Expect | OpinionThe cryptocurrency sector is fond of the analogy of “speed running the history of finance,” but we are also reprising the development of many other infrastructure-level technologies. From an electrical perspective, we are perhaps now in the 1860s. We have elaborated the circuitry of DeFi, and must now realize its potential to replace the oil lamps, hand cranks and steam engines of the present financial landscapes. Wiring AMMs together will require huge complementary efforts: rethinking security procedures and value capture through transaction ordering, a topic animating the widespread interest in grappling with maximum extractable value (MEV).The history of electricity has one other valuable lesson to teach us. While the mythos emphasizes independent inventors with their lightbulb moments, the reality was that the path from idea to impact was blazed by new modes of collaboration between institutions of higher learning and the world outside their walls. Prior to the 19th century, colleges and universities saw themselves as space apart – zones of aristocratic privilege or monastic scholarship in which inquiry was prized for its own right and disparaged if it became tinged with social or commercial usefulness. That began to change in Germany and the U.S., with emergent departments of electrical engineering often leading the charge to carry out research designed for commercial or civil application. In all likelihood, the present crisis in graduate education, with soaring tuition costs and vanishing opportunities for “pure” academic positions, represents another epoch-defining shift. It will be to the great benefit of the cryptocurrency sector to find ways to capitalize.With thanks to Robin Malik for his contributions.",2022/12/21
65,"Ethereum merged, decentralized finance (DeFi) imploded, FTX crashed and burned. Bitcoin, in the meantime, continued to build, said the Bitcoin Operations Technology Group (Optech) – a community of Bitcoin contributors – in its annual year-end review.The paper covers dozens of milestones: from ambitious scaling proposals such as validity rollups and the Taro test software, to captivating events like the establishment of a Bitcoin legal defense fund by Block CEO Jack Dorsey and a controversial Lightning Network Daemon (LND) bug that left part of the Lightning Network in disarray.Amid these developments, Optech highlighted three major themes that sparked both vigorous debate and vigorous coding: replace-by-fee, or RBF (a way to replace unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions), several soft fork proposals and 16 major Bitcoin ecosystem software releases.Taro, a new piece of software (currently under early testing) that will allow Bitcoin developers to create, send and receive assets on the Bitcoin blockchain (think stablecoins on Bitcoin), may be the most interesting of the milestones.Read more: Lightning Labs Releases Software to Allow Bitcoin Developers to Mint and Transfer Assets on the BlockchainOthers include validity rollups first floated by Bitcoin researcher John Light. A validity rollup would combine large numbers of transactions off-chain, validate those transactions, then submit the validated batch as a single “rolled up” transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain.Chaos broke out in November when Twitter user “Burak” (@brqgoo) exploited a bug that took down a large swath of the Lightning Network, raising questions about how the Bitcoin community should handle similar vulnerabilities in the future.Finally, Jack Dorsey, together with Alex Morcos and Martin White, established the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund. Dorsey announced the fund on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list, describing it as “a nonprofit entity that aims to minimize legal headaches that discourage software developers from actively developing Bitcoin and related projects.”Read more: Bitcoin After the Ethereum Merge: Experts Weigh InOne topic that seemed to polarize Bitcoiners all year long was the debate over Replace-By-Fee (RBF), a feature in Bitcoin Core that gives users the option to replace unconfirmed transactions with new transactions, as long as they’re willing to pay a higher fee for the replacement transaction. (Bitcoin Core is the dominant software used to connect to the Bitcoin network.)Why would anyone want to replace an unconfirmed transaction? Imagine Bob desperately needs to send one bitcoin (BTC) to Alice during a period of peak transaction volume (say, during a surge in Binance withdrawals). Bitcoin transactions are typically confirmed – accepted into a block of transactions that gets added to the Bitcoin blockchain – every 10 minutes or so. It’s been over 30 minutes and three blocks have already been confirmed, but because the network is at peak volume, no miner has accepted Bob’s transaction because other transactions are paying miners much higher fees. (Bitcoin miners process transactions and secure the network.)Bob’s unconfirmed transaction is officially “stuck.” With RBF, Bob can replace his original transaction and pay a higher fee to get it accepted by a miner.There are two main flavors of RBF. Opt-in RBF allows Bob to mark or “flag” his unconfirmed transactions as replaceable or not replaceable. Full RBF simply makes all unconfirmed transactions replaceable.Here’s where the controversy lies. According to some Bitcoin business owners, certain vendors are willing to accept riskier unconfirmed transactions because they deal with low value goods and services. Those vendors have strategically optimized their operations to minimize the risk from these zero confirmation (unconfirmed) transactions. The catch, though, is that optimization is only based on opt-in RBF and not full RBF.Other bitcoiners argue zero-confirmation fraud is a risk independent of RBF. Whatever the case may be, full RBF (menu option “mempoolfullrbf”) was introduced in Bitcoin Core version 24.0 last month. However, it’s switched off by default, meaning node operators running the Bitcoin Core software must proactively switch it on if they want to make all transactions replaceable.Soft forks are upgrades to a blockchain that are backwards-compatible. Nodes (computers on the Bitcoin network) that don’t upgrade still view the upgraded chain as valid (all nodes are still one big happy family).Conversely, hard forks result in a permanent change to the blockchain that isn’t backwards-compatible (nodes either accept the change or split off onto a separate blockchain).Bitcoin developers prefer adding new features to Bitcoin via soft forks rather than hard forks (unlike Ethereum developers).According to Optech, there was significant interest in soft fork proposals, especially around CheckTemplateVerify (CTV), a proposal by developer Jeremy Rubin, and AnyPrevOut (APO), a proposal by developers Christian Decker and Anthony Towns.CTV allows Bitcoin users to restrict or specify how their coins are spent, a concept known as a covenant. For example, a sender can use CTV to create a bitcoin cold storage vault that automatically releases a small amount of bitcoin to an assigned hot wallet on a scheduled basis (Rubin calls them structured liquidity vaults).APO is a proposal for a new type of public key that allows certain adjustments to a transaction even after it’s signed. This could be applicable for use cases like Eltoo, a proposed enhancement to the Lightning Network (Bitcoin’s layer 2 scaling system).Many of these proposals were discussed and updated but haven’t been implemented. Vibrant discussions are continuing.It was a busy year for Bitcoin builders. Optech lists 16 major software releases in 2022 from 8 Bitcoin ecosystem projects:Of all these releases, Bitcoin Core version 24.0, which introduced full RBF, may have been the most impactful, or at least the most talked about.",2022/12/21

69,"Core Scientific (CORZ), one of the largest bitcoin (BTC) miners by computing power, filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday and reached a deal with some of its lenders to restructure its debt.The company filed for Chapter 11 at Southern District of Texas bankruptcy court as crypto winter continues to take its toll on the industry. The miner's estimated liabilities are between $1 billion-$10 billion, according to the filing. It has around 1,000-5,000 creditors, with the largest unsecured claim coming from investment bank B. Riley.The miner's estimated assets are between $1 billion-$10 billion, according to the filing. At the end of the third quarter, Core Scientific's assets stood at $1.4 billion, whereas its liabilities were about $1.3 billion, according to its earnings report.The bankruptcy of Core Scientific, which accounts for about 10% of computing power on the bitcoin network, operating 143,000 mining rigs and hosting another 100,000 is the biggest one yet and is set to send shockwaves in an already crumbling industry.Core Scientific reached an agreement with some of its creditors, in what appears to be a prepackaged bankruptcy. In a prepackaged bankruptcy, the debtor reaches some sort of agreement with its debtee before officially filling for bankruptcy.The miner expects support from some of its convertible noteholders in the form of two debtor-in-possession (DIP) facilities, totaling up to $75 million, Core Scientific said in a press release. This support will help it go through the bankruptcy process, which it intends to do ""swiftly,"" the press release said. The miner had $544 million in convertible notes outstanding at the end of the third quarter.Existing convertible note holders will ""equitize their debt into a significant majority of the common stock of the reorganized company,"" the mining firm said. Other holders of general unsecured claims and existing common shareholders will also ""receive meaningful recoveries in the form of reorganized common stock and warrants"" under the restructuring deal.The company first warned of the risk of bankruptcy in late October, and said it wouldn't be paying some of its loan installments, sending its shares plummeting about 80% on Nasdaq. In November, it reiterated that it may run out of money by the end of this year.Last week, investment bank B. Riley proposed a $72 million financing plan, including $40 million of financing ""immediately"" and with ""zero contingencies."" However, the rest of the funding would be made available once bitcoin hit $18,500. Core Scientific has $42 million outstanding to the bank.Instead, Core Scientific expects to seal a deal with a group representing ""more than 50% of the holders of its convertible notes"" that will grant it $56 million in a DIP facility. The noteholders have agreed to syndicate up to ""$19 million in new money DIP Facility loans to all holders of convertible notes,"" the Wednesday press release said.""These funds, along with ongoing cash generated from operations, are anticipated to provide the necessary financing to effectuate the planned restructuring, facilitate the emergence from Chapter 11, and cover the fees and expenses of legal and financial advisors,"" the miner said.Core Scientific's operations ""remain significantly cash flow positive on a debt-free basis,"" the press release said.Core Scientific is one of several miners struggling to keep afloat as rising energy prices increase costs, while stubbornly low bitcoin prices slash revenue. Compute North, another major firm in the space, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September.Iris Energy (IREN) had to unplug about 72% of its computing power that was tied to just over $100 million of loans that it defaulted on. The loans were held by special-purpose non-recourse vehicles. In November, Argo Blockchain's (ARBK) deal to sell $27 million of equity to fund operations fell through and the company was subsequently downgraded by two analysts. Greenidge Generation (GREE) on Tuesday announced a debt restructuring deal with its lender NYDIG, but could still run out of cash in two months if it doesn't secure additional funding.Core Scientific has also been affected by the bankruptcy of lender Celsius Network's mining arm, one of its biggest clients, and lender BlockFi, to which it owes $54 million. Celsius Mining filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July and in September sued Core Scientific, claiming that it violated automatic stay terms. Core Scientific claims Celsius owes it $5.2 million as of Sept. 30. BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late November, one of many victims of crypto exchange FTX's implosion.Core Scientific was running 243,000 machines in its facilities as of the end of October, split between 14.4 exahash per second (EH/s) of bitcoin self-mining hashrate, and 10 EH/s of hosted machines for other firms, according to the filing.

""We think investors’ willingness to accumulate altcoins has been severely impacted by the deleveraging in 2022 and may take many months to fully recuperate.""BitDAO’s $100M token buyback proposal spurs community concernsBy Shaurya MalwaCommunity members of BitDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on driving adoption of its native BIT token ecosystem, this week proposed to set its Target Daily Purchase Amount (TDPA) at 2 million tether (USDT) per day for 50 days starting Jan. 1, 2023.The purchase amounts to a total purchase of 100 million USDT of BIT. BitDAO is styled as an open platform for proposals that are voted on by BIT token holders, and is agnostic to chains and projects, as per technical documents.According to the proposal, the recommended priorities for BitDAO capital deployment include high priority for BIT-related products and low priority for swaps and investments, as well as yield strategies.The DAO's treasury currently holds 300 million in USDT and USD coin (USDC), and 270,000 ether (ETH), valued at approximately $345 million, which is expected to be sufficient to cover at least five years of BIT product development.BitDAO community members said that the original strategy for the collective was to grow the treasury via direct investments and the creation of BitDAO-like entities (sub-DAO/autonomous entities) and investments.However, that strategy had a “questionable impact” on driving outcomes for BIT. “The most performant DAOs (Lido, Aave, Uni) have been centered on underlying core products that have large addressable markets and longevity,” the proposal stated, calling for higher priorities on “core products” related to BitDAO instead.One such core product is the upcoming Ethereum layer 2 network Mantle, the proposal said. The initial development of Mantle has been bootstrapped by Bybit, one of BitDAO’s key backers, with the next phase being a DAO proposal and budget cycles for expanded development and go-to-market activities.The proposal also recommended against pursuing complex financial derivatives such as swaps and investments that do not have strategic outcomes for BIT. The lack of flexibility for DAOs to negotiate competitive deals and limited options for post-investment legal and governance involvement once funds have been transferred were listed as key reasons for such a dissuasive move.Additionally, the proposal advised against participating in yield strategies due to the high systemic risk in the crypto market and the difficulty in calculating fair prices and slippage for altcoins. The risks associated with capital deployment and liquidity constraints when unwinding positions are also cited as reasons for caution.Responses on the currently live proposal remained mixed as of Wednesday morning.“It is not a good idea to buyback at this price level,” one community member said, citing BIT’s token prices remaining above the net asset value of a basket of underlying ether, USDT and USDC.“I’m afraid I have to disagree,” another poster said. “We should constantly buy back and burn. BIT tokens still don’t have demand, if we don’t buy back and burn BIT tokens will go to zero. Buyback and burn at least 2024 because every month 180 million tokens will release (sic).”Some community members pointed out crypto exchange Bybit’s upcoming token incentive program as a cause for concern. “I have reservations about this repurchase,” wrote one member. “Bybit is about to issue a year-end bonus of 92 million BIT. At this time, BitDAO proposed to repurchase it, giving people the feeling that the treasury will pay for the year-end bonus.”3:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:00 UTC) Germany Gfk Consumer Confidence Survey (Jan)9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Bank of Canada Consumer Price Index Core (YoY/Nov) 11:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(15:00 UTC) United States Consumer Confidence (Dec)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:FTX Developments; Who Moved 100 Bitcoins Tied to Defunct Crypto Exchange QuadrigaCX?""First Mover"" dived into the mystery of the sudden movement of 100 BTC tied to the bankrupt Canadian crypto exchange, QuadrigaCX.

74,"Shortly after the ball dropped in Times Square on New Year's Eve welcoming in 2022, the cryptocurrency, blockchain and digital assets community rang in the new year with thoughts of mass adoption into the mainstream. Bitcoin was trading around $40,000, an iconic arena in Los Angeles had just changed its name to one of the major crypto exchanges, and celebrities, athletes and musicians were lining up to sing the praises of this new financial ecosystem.Bill Callahan, a former special agent financial investigator with the U.S. Department of Justice, is the director of government and strategic affairs at the Blockchain Intelligence Group. This article is part of Crypto 2023.It’s been a bumpy ride since then. Bitcoin is down 60%. Once-prominent crypto apps Celsius Network and BlockFi are sitting in bankruptcy court. And as we head into the new year, at least one stadium will have to scrub a crypto exchange’s name off its facade.Law enforcement, financial investigators and anti-money laundering examiners have had their hands full with digital asset-related scams, frauds, thefts and hacks this year. And we’re not just talking about stolen Bored Apes (though more than a few were phished). If we learned anything in 2022, it’s that blockchain analytics can help speed up an investigation – from the time law enforcement is first alerted to a potential financial crime to the time of arrest.In March, my company, Blockchain Intelligence Group, uncovered potential suspicious activity involving a non-fungible token (NFT) project called Frosties and notified law enforcement authorities. Agents were able to track and trace financial transactions along the blockchain and along with other electronic data, were able to identify the culprits, arrest them and prevent another planned NFT fraud.See also: Crypto 2023: It's Sanctions SeasonWhat ordinarily would have taken months of painstaking financial investigative work was reduced to a matter of weeks. That’s important, considering the number and value of crypto exploits actually increased this year – despite the market pull back.In 2023, the need for blockchain investigators (and analytics tools) will grow: from global regulatory agencies handling complex investigations of cyber-attacks and the cross-jurisdictional movement of money to local police agencies responding to citizen complaints of romance or investment scams.Local police departments will no longer have the luxury to send these investigations to the feds but will dedicate resources to train and equip financial and economic crime detectives with the latest in cryptocurrency investigation education.In 2023, crypto service providers will need to learn more about the trans-national criminal organization (TCO) and drug trafficking organizations (DTO), to use the parlance of investigators. It’s every ecosystem participant’s duty to file suspicious activity reports and stay aware of potential crimes.Just as during the rise of the modern drug cartel in 1980s and 1990s, specific players have emerged with new technologies to service and support bad actors. Crypto, with its unprecedented level of transparency, should make it difficult for dark flows of cash – though that doesn’t always happen.Although crypto is verifiable, transnational criminal syndicates benefit from the censorship resistance of decentralized networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum (and maybe a handful of others) to consolidate their earnings from illicit activity.See also: 10 Predictions About Crypto in 2023Then there’s the rise of crime-as-a-service, such as providing a crypto for fiat or vice versa exchange, code and instructions to conduct a hack or a wallet service to collect crypto from a phishing scam. Actors have and will continue to emerge to segregate these duties from each other.Blockchain analysis can help track flows from criminal activity, but it’s only part of a potential solution. Education on how to avoid being a victim of cryptocurrency fraud needs to increase in 2023. That will start with communities revolting against the proliferation of bitcoin ATM machines in places where you traditionally would not do your banking or investing (i.e., bars, gas stations and the back of a convenience store) – which have emerged as potential money laundering jukeboxes.While the criminal element will continue their attacks, the cybersecurity industry will strengthen. Blockchain and cryptocurrency analytics will be incorporated into the response. The digital asset investigations space will continue to grow, tools to track and trace cryptocurrency scams and frauds will become more affordable and readily available to local police agencies and financial investigators will not just follow the money, they will follow the coins.",2022/12/20
75,"Money is searching for quality in both traditional and digital assets, as investors appear to favor safety above all for right now.CoinDesk Indices (CDI) data shows the Currency Select Index (CCYS), anchored by bitcoin (BTC), and the Smart Contract Platform Index (SCPX), anchored by ether (ETH), outperforming other select sectors within the CMI universe.CMI sectors represent comprehensive groupings of digital assets by sector, allowing for measurement of performance and a comparison.What today’s data shows is that, similar to in past market cycles, flights to safety within the cryptosphere is translating to movement of capital into BTC and ETH, relative to other coins.On the other end of the spectrum, the more speculative Computing Index (CPU) and Culture & Entertainment (CNE) have lagged other sectors in both week to date and month to date performance.The rotation of capital from perceived risk to perceived safety in crypto markets is occurring in conjunction with similar flows within traditional finance.Relative Rotation Graphs (RRG), a tool developed by Julius de Kempanaer, allows for assets to be tracked versus a selected benchmark. Assets are subsequently separated into four distinct quadrants.We compared the following seven SPDR exchange-traded funds (ETF) using the S&P 500 as the benchmark.Defensive sectors such as consumer staples, health care and utilities lead the S&P 500 currently. The more speculative consumer discretionary and technology sectors are lagging and weakening versus the benchmark.The similar behavior among investors in the two asset classes implies that everyone is choosing safety at the moment.For those who prefer traditional equities, that translates to utilities, health care and consumer staples. For those who prefer traditional assets, the assets of choice are bitcoin and ether.Interestingly, adding bitcoin and ether to the same RRG shows that they both fall into the leading quadrant as well.This appears counterintuitive, as you would be hard-pressed to find someone who would place cryptocurrencies within the same risk bucket as health-care stocks.But the landscape of markets is ever-changing. And in today’s environment, investors looking for safety in both crypto and traditional equities have landed within the same area.",2022/12/20
76,"The CoinDesk Currency Index Ex Stablecoin (CCX) is designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of constituents in the CoinDesk Currency Index excluding stablecoins. CCX reflects the DACS as of the prior month, so the Currency sector refers to any digital asset acting primarily as a medium of exchange and unit of account running on a blockchain network with the ability to complete cross-border transactions without restriction. Digital assets in the Currency sector do not necessarily act as a store of value[1].As of Dec 15, 2022, CCX lost 10.3% for the quarter to date (QTD), and included 25 digital assets assigned to seven industries in three industry groups according to the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS).Read more: CoinDesk Market Outlook: 4Q Crypto Gloom Spills Into 2023The Currency Sector’s fourth quarter filled investors with thrills and worries alike: On-again, off-again tokens such as dogecoin (DOGE) and litecoin (LTC) performed well, even as bellwether bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, faced multiple threats.Bitcoin (BTC) was down 11% for the quarter as traders felt the continuing nervousness over the market uncertainty thanks to the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance.“The probability of a recession is high,” crypto trader Thomas Kralow said in an emailed comment. “People lose their jobs, the Fed pivots too late and we will see the same situation that played out back in 2008. When the Fed pivoted there was a relief rally for S&P 500, but as the interest rates finally started going down the market crashed another 40%.”Kralow pointed out that the markets bottomed when the fed funds rate was basically at zero, adding: “This doesn’t bode well for bitcoin in 2023, and we could potentially see its price fall to $10,000 or even lower next year.”[1] As of Dec. 15, 2022, the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS) was updated, and the definition of “currency” changed. However, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) Family will reflect the changes as of the January reconstitution in accordance with its standard methodology.(Fourth quarter performance as of Dec 15, 2022.)The CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Index (SMT)The CoinDesk DeFi Index (DCF)The CoinDesk Culture & Entertainment Index (CNE)The CoinDesk Computing Index (CPU)The CoinDesk Digitization Index (DTZ)",2022/12/20
77,"As if 2022 weren’t already brutal enough on crypto investors, the fourth quarter brought an ugly coda with the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange – triggering another leg down in prices, spurring a fresh bout of contagion and enshrining the year as one of the worst ever in the digital-asset industry’s history.The CoinDesk Market Ex Stablecoin Index (CMIX), a broad benchmark encompassing 163 digital assets, fell 12% from September through Dec. 15, and the gloom is hard to shake off as analysts turn their sights to 2023.The CoinDesk Market Ex Stablecoin Index (CMIX): CMIX is a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of constituents in the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) excluding stablecoins. Inclusion of a digital asset in CMIX is subject to minimum trading and exchange eligibility requirements.The crypto industry’s self-inflicted wounds – U.S. prosecutors and regulators this month accused Bankman-Fried of orchestrating a $8 billion scheme to defraud investors – came as the Federal Reserve kept ratcheting monetary conditions ever tighter to bring down soaring inflation, adding stiff downward pressure on prices for cryptocurrencies and other risky assets.Last year’s price run-up in the largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), to a record $69,000 brought rampant speculation and risk-taking by crypto traders who used “leverage,” or borrowed money, to amplify their bets. The unwinding of that leverage over the course of 2022 served to accelerate the market’s descent. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index has tumbled 65% this year to about $16,594 at the time of writing.""It kind of almost got out of hand, and in a lot of ways it did get out of hand,” said Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto analytics firm Amberdata. “Now we're getting a recalibration of excess leverage. We're also getting consequences for people who've kind of taken advantage of that opportunity.”Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest by market cap, slid 5.5% in the quarter through Dec. 15, and it’s down 68% in 2022, its worst performance since the crypto winter of 2018. The broad downward market pressures and a dropoff in activity outweighed any pickup in sentiment that came from the blockchain’s successful upgrade this year – the “Merge” – to a more energy-efficient “proof-of-stake” network from a “proof-of-work” system similar to Bitcoin’s. More recently, speculation has mounted that the change might make ether more prone to regulation as a security under U.S. regulations.Coming into the fourth quarter, crypto traders and analysts were speculating whether markets might be starting to heal from the steep losses earlier in the year inflicted by the collapse of Terra and the knock-on casualties of crypto financial firms Celsius Network, Voyager Digital and Three Arrows Capital.The epic unraveling of FTX – initiated by an exclusive CoinDesk report that the Alameda Research trading firm’s balance sheet was dependent on sister company FTX’s in-house utility token, FTT – soon dashed the optimism.FTT was, unsurprisingly, one of the biggest losers in digital-asset markets, plunging about 95% just in the fourth quarter alone. (The FTT token wasn’t part of the CoinDesk Market Index because it didn’t meet the key requirement of being listed for at least 30 days on at least two eligible exchanges. It was only listed on one.)Among the biggest losers in the CMIX from the FTX fallout was the Solana blockchain’s SOL token, the largest among a handful of so-called “Sam Coins” that had been championed by Bankman-Fried. The SOL price tanked 58% during the quarter.The contagion spread to Maple Finance, a decentralized lending platform that suffered some $54 million of loan defaults, some of them linked indirectly to the FTX failure. Maple’s MPL token was the quarter’s single biggest loser in the CMIX, diving 78%.A few winners worth mentioning: Dogecoin (DOGE) rallied 42% for the quarter to date (QTD). The meme coin doubled in October following Elon Musk’s dramatic $44 billion takeover of Twitter. (By the end of the quarter it was looking a bit dog-tired, shaving some of those returns.) Litecoin (LTC) jumped 35% in the quarter, with its third mining-reward halving approaching in 2023; the scheduled blockchain event will cut LTC's pace of supply expansion by 50%.Recent signs have emerged in digital-asset markets that the FTX turmoil may have passed.Whether that translates to a market turnaround in 2023 might depend, to a certain extent, on the direction of U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy. Bitcoin’s overall price direction is still closely linked to the trajectory of traditional markets, and the largest cryptocurrency by market value often sets the course for broader digital-assets markets.Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at the crypto asset manager Bitwise, says the digital-asset markets are entering a “period of indifference.”“If you look back at other previous bear markets, they go through this classic style of people not believing it’s happening, and people being angered that there’s a period of capitulation. And [people say the] worst, and crypto is dead,” Hougan said. “We’re going to have to go through a period of six months where no one outside of the crypto industry cares about crypto.”He added: “That’s sort of what leads into the next bull market that’s happened each time in the past, and I see no reason to believe that this time will be different.”As of Dec 15, 2022, CMIX lost 12% QTD, and included 163 digital assets assigned to 33 industries in 21 industry groups in six sectors according to the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS).(Fourth quarter performance as of Dec 15, 2022.)The CoinDesk Currency Index, Excluding Stablecoins (CCX)The CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Index (SMT)The CoinDesk DeFi Index (DCF)The CoinDesk Culture & Entertainment Index (CNE)The CoinDesk Computing Index (CPU)The CoinDesk Digitization Index (DTZ)",2022/12/20
78,"Bitcoiners in Nigeria, Tanzania, South Africa, Kenya and five other African countries can now send and receive bitcoin (BTC) without a smartphone or Internet connection. Just a basic feature phone and text code will suffice, thanks to a digital wallet from a company called Machankura.Despite the global smartphone revolution, mid-2000s-style phones with more limited functionality remain extremely popular in Africa. Machankura – a word that’s South African township slang meaning ""money"" – has popped up to serve that base of devices and satisfy the desire among many on the continent to use bitcoin as a currency for transactions.The technological challenge is high, of course. No internet connection and low-horsepower phones mean boiling down the money exchange to essentially sending something like texts. Machankura says it works, and taps into Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, which facilities faster and cheaper transactions.“I started Machankura to make bitcoin more accessible in communities, where not everyone has an Internet-connected device,” Kgothatso Ngako, South African computer science researcher and developer turned entrepreneur, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Anyone who's interested in using bitcoin and living on bitcoin should be able to do so easily.”Read more: South African Non-Profit Bitcoin Ekasi Opens Education Center Unlike other places where bitcoin acts more like digital gold – or something to hoard as an investment or speculative instrument – several communities in South Africa, like Bitcoin Ekasi, use bitcoin as they would a traditional currency. But exactly how do they do that without an iPhone or other smartphone?That’s where “mobile money” comes in. That doesn’t just involve cryptocurrencies. It’s any service that lets people conduct financial transactions through their phone, without the need for a traditional bank account. According to the World Bank, about a third of adults in sub-Saharan Africa have a mobile money account – showing a large audience of receptive potential customers for Machankura.Mobile money involves a communications protocol called Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), which is similar to the more widely known texting protocol called Short Message Service (SMS).“In Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa, if it's a digital payment, there's a [good] chance that it's a mobile money payment instead of a card,” Ngako explains.Read more: Crypto Is Quietly Thriving in Sub-Saharan Africa: Chainalysis ReportTo send bitcoin with Machankura, first-time users simply dial a country code like “*920*8333#” for Ghana or “*483*8333#” for Kenya. This brings up a registration menu that requests a five-digit PIN.After registering, a subsequent menu offers additional functionality like sending or receiving bitcoin and viewing transaction history (users press the number on their feature phone corresponding to the desired menu option).If a customer chooses to send or receive bitcoin, Machankura has integrated one crucial feature that significantly improves the user experience – personalized Lightning addresses.“On the feature phone keypad, the user has to be able to input a Lightning address,” Ngako explains.Instead of regular Lightning invoice addresses that can be over 200 alphanumeric characters long – well over the 182 USSD character limit – these personalized addresses are the length of a typical email handle. This makes them much easier to type out on feature phones with multi-press text entry (where each digit represents multiple letters).Machankura’s default Lightning address combines a user’s phone number and Machankura’s “@8333.mobi” domain (e.g., 123456789@8333.mobi). Users can also modify these addresses to conceal their phone numbers (e.g., johndoe@8333.mobi).Once a user has a few sats in the wallet (1 bitcoin is comprised of 100 million satoshis, or “sats”), integrations with gift card and voucher services like Bitrefill and Azteco make it possible to spend those sats on everyday purchases or redeem vouchers for bitcoin.“I went to my grandmother's village in Mpumalanga, and over an hour-long walk, in seven out of eight stores, I was able to redeem my voucher,” Ngako says.If Machankura sounds too good to be true, remember that it’s a custodial wallet, meaning users don’t control their own bitcoin and must trust the company. This also explains how users can send and receive bitcoin with no Internet connection – Machankura does it for them behind the scenes (by running Internet-connected Bitcoin and Lightning nodes on the back end).There’s no “free lunch,” so some of those behind-the-scenes costs are passed on to users. Specifically, sending bitcoin will incur a 1% transaction fee, which is Machankura’s revenue source.Despite the fees and the custodial model, Ngako’s efforts have garnered glowing reviews from prominent Bitcoiners including Elizabeth Stark, CEO and co-founder of Lightning infrastructure firm Lightning Labs.Ngako is hoping to raise capital and eventually establish Machankura in all 54 African countries over the next few years.“It's been self-funded to this point,” Ngako said. “And, now, I'm in the process of raising capital, so I'll see how that goes.”CORRECTION (Dec. 20, 2022, 20:58 UTC): Corrects spelling of village’s name to Mpumalanga.",2022/12/20
79,"Think back to one year ago. Bitcoin traded at around $50,000, you couldn’t watch sports without seeing a crypto advertisement, and you could get rich – or at least it felt that way – by minting a non-fungible token (NFT) of your left nostril.At the time, who could have predicted the collapse of Celsius Network and Voyager Digital? Or that Matt Damon would become a crypto punchline? Or that the space’s golden child, Sam Bankman-Fried, would turn from Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader?This article is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.This is all preamble to say that there are no crystal balls. Predictions are often wrong. Trends can change on a dime. But then again, perhaps after the FTX-flavored gloom of the last two months, speculating on 2023 is exactly what we need to cleanse the palate.“As we enter 2023, what happens with crypto funding in Q1 will be critical as to whether we stay in a sustained bear market,” suspects Jamie Burke, CEO and founder of Outlier Ventures. On the one hand, he notes that “the strength of the venture market has persisted, with billions of funding still pouring into the space and high levels of capital waiting to be deployed,” and that “we have seen a record number of applications in our most recent cohorts for 2022.”Then again, Burke acknowledges that “the venture landscape is undeniably changing,” and that “fund managers going into 2023 are conserving capital” instead of the bull run’s strategy of “spray and pray.” He predicts that next year, many investors will “double down on existing, less risky investments from later-stage companies already showing growth.”As to what that could mean for the space at large? Or how else crypto might twist and turn in 2023? We’ve rounded up predictions from smart people in the space – from the bullish to the skeptical.See also: The Future of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in 2023 | OpinionThe exact outcome is anyone’s guess, but 2023 could be the year where the clashes over regulation finally reach their climax. “There’s going to be harsh crypto regulation proposed and an epic battle by the community to fight the parts of it that threaten decentralization,” says Laura Shin, host of the “Unchained” podcast.“Larger macro downturn market conditions should hopefully shift crypto projects away from speculation and more towards utility – one major utility category simply being meaningful, fun, social experiences,” predicts Alex Zhang, the de facto head of Friends with Benefits DAO. He expects this to translate to “more meaningful Web3 social platforms and protocols,” and foresees growth in “interoperable identity, on-chain social graphs, and crypto-abstracted social experiences.”And for a less optimistic take…“The contagion isn’t anywhere close to over,” says Cas Piancey, co-host of the “Crypto Critics’ Corner” podcast. Piancey says that “companies, banks and funds are desperately hoping the market moves past the FTX and Alameda collapse or strictly focuses on their malfeasance,” but whether people like it or not, “you can’t wish away a credit crunch and exposure to bad counterparties. We will see the closure of funds and the faltering of companies we didn’t expect – mostly simply due to the fact that the contagion is too vast and too difficult for us all to quantify.”Read more: ReFi Will Take Crypto and Climate Change Mainstream | OpinionWhen I spoke with Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer of Human Rights Foundation, he had just returned from a bitcoin conference in Ghana. “I was blown away,” says Gladstein. “I was staggered by the number of bitcoin entrepreneurs and leaders from so many different countries.” He met people from rural Cameroon, from Democratic Republic of the Congo, from Somalia, from conflict zones. “They’re all just building on bitcoin. It’s legitimately amazing,” he says, which is why he believes that “global adoption is probably the number one story for next year.”When asked for his 2023 predictions, the bitcoin mega-bull Peter McCormack, host of “What Bitcoin Did” podcast, replied simply, “Real Bedford will win the league.” Obviously this is a cheeky joke (McCormack purchased the team in 2021), but this might contain the kernel of a deeper truth: For many in the space, during crypto winter, it’s useful – even healthy – to focus on other interests.“Fashion will continue to lead the way when it comes to Web3 adoption,” says Cathy Hackl, chief metaverse officer at Journey. “We will see further collaborations between Web3 personalities and consumer and luxury brands that want to explore new commerce models and customer touchpoints.” Hackl’s bonus prediction: “With the rise of generative AI, we might see blockchain play a significant role in helping us to distinguish between content created by AI and content created by humans.”“The sustained high-risk appetite in NFT-funding in 2022 is a strong indicator that it will be one of the first sectors to recover next year,” says Burke. “Throughout the past year, we were already beginning to see major NFT investments from major Web2 brands [Starbucks and Disney] and across Web3. … This shows no sign of stopping in 2023. Brands will continue to flock to NFTs.”Burke is similarly bullish on gaming, as “prominent Web3 game titles that have been in development for quite some time including Big Time, Star Atlas, Ember Sword, will finally see the light of day in 2023, either as full-fledged games or more playable demos.”As for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)? “Although it may seem that the current bear market has forced the industry to hit pause, the growth of new DAOs has accelerated exponentially, with each month in 2022 producing more new DAOs than 2021 witnessed altogether,” says Burke.“Exchange stack gets disaggregated – we see custody, brokerage and exchange/price discovery get broken out into different players, just like in [traditional finance]. This makes it impossible for another FTX to happen,” says Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at Dragonfly Capital.Then Qureshi offers a parallel prediction: “When trust is low, incumbents consolidate. Coinbase, Binance, Uniswap will likely gain market share in aggregate, as people are less likely to trust smaller and weaker players. Network effects get stronger.”And finally …“Read the room and assess the damage,” says Sandra Ro, CEO of the Global Blockchain Business Council, who then gives a bit of advice for the space at large: “Regroup with humility, rebuild with integrity, regain trust, rise again.”",2022/12/20
80,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) took off in the summer of 2020 and has become synonymous with the last bull market as well as a lot of speculative activity since then. DeFi was born, in part, to address the failures of banking institutions to provide for a transparent and inclusive financial system. ReFi, or regenerative finance, is about leveraging crypto rails to rebuild our economies in ways that are more inclusive and sustainable. My prediction in 2023 is that ReFi will be hotter than DeFi, especially at the intersection of crypto and climate change.Outside of the bear market and scandals, the Ethereum Merge dominated much of the narrative in 2022. One of the most discussed, debated and analyzed outcomes from the Merge was the resulting drastic reduction in carbon emissions from the new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism for Ethereum, particularly juxtaposed with Bitcoin’s energy intensive proof-of-work mechanism.Yet, this is just the tip of the iceberg regarding the relationship between crypto and climate. As we head into 2023 we are starting to see dozens of exciting Web3 projects focused on leveraging crypto rails for accelerating the path to the low-carbon economy, while new venture funds focused on ReFi are being launched to accelerate these projects.Boyd Cohen is CEO and co-founder of Iomob, the developers of WheelCoin, a Move2Earn game that rewards users for moving green. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 outlook.There is a surprising number of layer one and layer two blockchains that are explicitly focused on promoting and supporting the low-carbon economy and even creating ecosystem funding to encourage ReFi projects to deploy on their blockchain. The list includes Cosmos, Hedera, Topl, Polygon, Celo, Near and Algorand among many others.Yet, what is more interesting, to me at least, are the projects being deployed on these blockchains that have a more direct impact on industries, people and the planet as we move up the stack towards the app layer.The most dominant ReFi sector for climate has been tied to bringing more transparency to the $270 billion global carbon offset market. Carbon offsets have long been questioned regarding the credibility of the actual claims made by carbon originators and the offset buyers. While standards have been introduced to help create more accountability in the sector, there remains healthy skepticism in the public domain.The Cosmos-based Regen Network focuses on helping communities of land owners generate on-chain digital carbon offsets. Meanwhile, Klima DAO has created a tokenized carbon offset scheme which, at the time of writing, has supported the transparent removal of more than 17 million tons of carbon from the global atmosphere.What is even more exciting to me is that we are starting to see greenshoots of ReFi that go way beyond base-layer blockchains and carbon offsets. Every industry and consumer activity has some kind of climate impact and ReFi projects are emerging to tackle these challenges on crypto rails.Similar to bringing carbon offsets on-chain, Reneum is leveraging blockchain tech to create more transparency in the renewable energy credits (REC) space. Meanwhile, Powerledger has been an early player in facilitating peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralized renewable energy trading since its inception in 2016.On the end-user level, I am optimistic we will start to see ways to gamify the adoption of low carbon lifestyles such as through move2earn (M2E) projects. Tying M2E with carbon reduction and perhaps the creation of personalized, transparent and tokenized carbon offsets could become a thing in 2023.Recently the World Economic Forum launched the Crypto Sustainability Coalition to focus on accelerating the adoption of ReFi use cases. The famous X Prize, created originally by Elon Musk to reward disruptive climate innovation, is now moving into the ReFi space.In the past few months several new venture funds and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) have been launched focused on the ReFi space such as Cerulean Ventures, AeraForce DAO, ReFi Venture Studio, Allegory, a100x, Vanagon Ventures, Possible Ventures and Draft Ventures. Just as mainstream venture capitalists have increasingly embraced environment and social governance (ESG) metrics and launched sustainability-focused funds, I believe in 2023 we will also start to see mainstream-impact funds and crypto funds, deploying ReFi-themed funds.Yes, as we head into 2023 we remain in a bear market with little hope for a near-term return towards more bullish conditions. I am convinced 2023 will be the year that ReFi gains more mainstream attention and adoption and helps to prove how crypto has tangible impacts on the real world and helps to change the narrative from the scams of 2022 to a force for positive change and an accelerant towards a more sustainable, low-carbon economy.",2022/12/20
81,"On Wednesday, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) introduced the “Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act,” which would impose sweeping surveillance and registration requirements on almost all participants in blockchain networks – including software developers, miners and wallet creators. The bill would also effectively ban privacy-enhancing technologies in blockchain networks. The bill is a disaster for digital privacy and civil liberties.Marta Belcher is the president and chair of the Filecoin Foundation and the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web and general counsel and head of policy at Protocol Labs. She is also special counsel to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a member of the Zcash Foundation Board. Her views are her own.The bill would require almost all participants in blockchain networks to register as money service businesses, including not only miners and wallet creators but also software developers. Those who would need to register as money service businesses under the bill’s shockingly expansive language include miners, validators, nodes, both custodial and ""self-hosted"" cryptocurrency wallet providers and, as a catch-all, any “independent network participants” who have “control over network protocols.”Anyone who fits into one of these categories (i.e., basically any blockchain network participant) would need to register with the government as a money service business, develop and maintain complicated anti-money-laundering programs, collect the personal information of every person who uses their software and automatically file reports with the government about users’ transactions over a certain amount (regardless of whether those transactions are suspicious).See also: The Coming Privacy Wars In short, the bill would grind the entire blockchain ecosystem in the U.S. to a halt, including chilling the ability of software developers to work on these technologies and preventing Americans from interacting with permissionless blockchains. It is simply too onerous for individual network participants like developers and miners to comply with the rules for money service businesses.In fact, compliance is not only onerous but in many cases impossible. For example, money service businesses are required to verify the identity of all users and report information about those users’ transactions to the government. For many blockchain network participants, this is simply not possible. For example, bitcoin miners have no way of knowing the identity of the users whose transactions they are facilitating and developers of open-source software have no way of knowing the identities of those who ultimately use their software.This is by design: The precise reason that blockchain technology is important, from a civil liberties perspective, is that it imports the privacy of cash into the online world. This new bill seeks to flip the entire purpose of blockchain on its head, turning it into a permissioned technology in which all users are surveilled by centralized gatekeepers.In addition, the bill effectively bans privacy-enhancing technologies in blockchain networks. The bill would prohibit all financial institutions from handling, using or transacting with digital asset mixers, privacy coins and “any other anonymity-enhancing technologies.” The list of financial institutions prohibited from interacting with privacy-enhancing technologies includes the broad group of blockchain network participants that would be classified as money-service businesses under the bill – meaning that developers, miners, validators and custodial and self-hosted wallet creators would all effectively be prohibited from interacting with privacy-enhancing technologies, including privacy coins.In introducing the bill, Sen. Warren used the refrain that privacy-enhancing technology facilitates crime. This is wrong, and it’s exactly the line of reasoning we hear from critics of end-to-end encryption and Tor (which enables anonymous web browsing). That a technology could be used to violate the law does not mean that there is something wrong with that technology. Criminals have long used cash to commit crimes, but we don’t call for a ban on cash as a result. For the same reason, we don’t call for a ban on cars, even though they can be used as getaway vehicles. In the 1980s, studios tried to make VCRs illegal because they could be used for copyright infringement – and they almost succeeded. Like cars and VCRs, privacy-enhancing technologies serve an important purpose and should not be banned merely because they could be misused.See also: The Ongoing Fight for Privacy – a Conversation With Marta Belcher That purpose is protecting civil liberties. Sen. Warren seems to have forgotten that privacy and anonymity are not bad or illegal; in fact, they are essential for civil liberties. Privacy is especially important for financial transactions, which provide an intimate window into our lives – what organizations we donate to, what books and products we buy, who we support and where we go. The ability to transact privately allows people to engage in First Amendment-⁠protected political activities, including protesting, donating to advocacy organizations and engaging in activities that may be sensitive or controversial. That blockchain technology imports the privacy protections of cash into the online world is a feature, not a bug.The U.S. government has long been targeting blockchain networks to expand the reach of its financial surveillance, including adding the Tornado Cash mixer to the U.S. sanctions list earlier this year. Imposing sweeping reporting requirements on nearly every blockchain network participant and effectively banning privacy-enhancing technologies in blockchain networks through this latest bill would create a near-total surveillance regime for blockchain transactions.",2022/12/20
82,"Bitcoin mining firm Greenidge Generation (GREE) came to an agreement with its lender, NYDIG, about restructuring $74.7 million of debt, though a bankruptcy is still on the cards.Cash burn is unsustainable and the firm's board is engaged ""in active discussions about the potential for, and timing of, a voluntary bankruptcy filing,"" Greenidge said in a Tuesday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If the deal with NYDIG is finalized, Greenidge still needs $20 million in fresh funding through 2023 to avoid bankruptcy.Under the deal, which is currently in the form of a non-binding term sheet, NYDIG will purchase 2.8 exahash per second (EH/s) worth of Greenidge's bitcoin mining machines, and extinguish $57 million to $68 million of the debt. That will leave Greenidge with 1.2 EH/s of machines, and the miner will also pledge the rest of its unencumbered assets to secure the rest of the loan, which will be somewhere between $6 million to $17 million.The loan in question had about $74.7 million outstanding as of Sept. 30. Prior to reaching a deal with NYDIG, Greenidge had estimated it would have to spend a minimum of $66.5 million in principal payments throughout 2023.Greenidge will host NYDIG's machines, effectively changing its business model from self-mining to hosting, the filing said. Hosting has proved a difficult business model to maintain in 2022, particularly for miners like Greenidge that are exposed to natural gas prices. Greenidge's costs of revenue, which come both from mining bitcoin and selling energy produced in its natural gas plant in upstate New York, grew by 104% year on year in Q3, according to Greenidge's quarterly earnings report.Greenidge is one of several miners that have warned about cash burn rates, including Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Core Scientific (CORZ).During October and November, Greenidge burned through $8 million a month, of which $5.5 million went to NYDIG payments. It expects the same cash burn rate for December, which would put a significant hole through its remaining $22 million of cash and cash equivalents. If Greendige doesn't secure funding, it may run out of cash in the next two months.The miner will host up to 74 megawatts (MW) of NYDIG's machines. As of Sept. 30, Greenidge ""powered approximately 76 MW of mining capacity capable of producing an estimated aggregate hash rate of 2.4 EH/s."" The firm owns a 106 MW natural gas power plant in New York.Greenidge will also transfer its coupons with machine manufacturer Bitmain to NYDIG. Within three months of the debt restructuring and hosting deals being agreed upon, Greenidge will also transfer machines awaiting deployment to NYDIG, and later provide the lender with an additional 39 MW of hosting.The miner has also faced regulatory turbulence in its home state of New York, where environmental concerns led to its air permit renewal being denied this summer.UPDATE (Dec. 20, 13:10 UTC): Adds additional details and background.",2022/12/20
83,"Layer 2 Labs has raised a $3 million seed round from angel investors to bring drivechains and other innovative technologies to Bitcoin.Drivechains are a type of sidechain – a secondary blockchain that interacts with a primary blockchain and aims to offer a better user experience (UX). The company’s CEO and founder, Paul Sztorc, a well-known Bitcoin researcher and developer, has been working on drivechains since 2015.Sztorc outlined the concept of drivechains in Bitcoin improvement proposals (BIPs) 300 and 301. The technology, which will be Layer 2 Labs’ primary focus, allows users to move bitcoin (BTC) back and forth between the main Bitcoin blockchain and multiple drivechains.According to Sztorc, the purpose of drivechains is to give Bitcoiners access to innovative features and products currently confined to altcoin networks. Examples would be Zcash’s zero-knowledge proofs, a way of proving something without revealing sensitive information, and Ethereum’s Augur, a prediction market where users bid on specific outcomes.“We believe that drivechains have the potential to kill altcoins, increase bitcoin adoption and provide the catalyst for hyperbitcoinization,” said the company in a release provided to CoinDesk. (Hyperbitcoinization is the point where Bitcoin becomes the world’s dominant monetary system.)Besides Sztorc, Layer 2 Labs’ founding team includes Bitcoin Core contributor CryptAxe and 8-year Kraken veteran Austin Alexander.Read more: How Two New Sidechains Proposals Could Change Bitcoin's DNA",2022/12/20

85,"Bitcoin (BTC) traded higher early Tuesday, defying the Bank of Japan (BOJ)-inspired slump in stock markets.The BOJ unexpectedly lifted the cap on the 10-year Japanese government bond yield to 0.5% from the previous 0.25%, ending the long period of near-zero interest rates. The 10-year yield serves as a benchmark for other borrowing rates.The central bank said the policy tweak would facilitate the transmission of monetary-easing effects, indicating that it didn't want markets to read it as a sign the BOJ is finally pivoting away from liquidity easing.However, risk assets did just that. The futures tied to the S&P 500 fell nearly 1% and Nikkei, Japan's benchmark equity index, tanked nearly 3%. The Japanese yen jumped over 2% against the U.S. dollar. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield rose from 0.22% to 0.43%, while the 10-year Treasury yield jumped nearly 10 basis points to 3.69%.Bitcoin, however, remained resilient, rising 2% to $16,800. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value after bitcoin, rose 3.2% to $1,206, CoinDesk data shows.The reaction in equities and bond yields is understandable, considering the BOJ's policy of capping the 10-year yield near zero with unlimited liquidity-boosting open-ended bond purchases, also known as yield curve control (YCC), was a major source of downward pressure on borrowing costs in Asia and worldwide and supported risk-taking. The Yen was supposedly used to fund risk-taking activities elsewhere.The central bank introduced yield curve control six years ago and remained committed to it this year even as the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks lifted rates.""The BOJ funding was the cheapest source of liquidity,"" Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital said. ""While the policy tweak is not a removal of YCC, the signaling will lead people to extrapolate that BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will seek to exit YCC by the end of this term in April.""QCP added that the surprise decision to lift the 10-year yield cap to 0.5% during the low-volume, pre-Christmas days has raised the risk of a VaR shock but is unlikely to have a direct consequence for cryptocurrencies.""We doubt crypto assets are directly affected by the decision,"" QCP said, adding that a big meltdown in equities could bring more pain to bitcoin.Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at Astronaut Capital, voiced a similar opinion. ""The initial market reaction to BOJ has been clear risk off. It’s hard to say if it will stick, however cryptos have rebounded slightly. At this stage we believe any strength or decorrelation is simply a lag. If we see equities lower, the same will be true for crypto,"" Dibb told CoinDesk.Fin Twitter is scared that BOJ's decision has set the stage for a global meltdown.""Bank of Japan basically broke the world tonight,"" Christian H. Cooper, an exchange-traded fund portfolio manager at Subversive, tweeted. ""A minor policy tweak has huge implications that will take weeks to play out.""""BOJ was the last low-yield holdout and now that changes. Spikes in rates, stocks lower (for weeks), + Chaos,' Cooper added.Kyle Bass, chief investment officer at Hayman Capital Management, tweeted that BOJ will ""deeply regret"" the move and the emerging world is at risk due to the policy tweak.Crypto services provider Matrixport's head of strategy and research, Markus Thielen, said the BOJ's move and the resulting yen strength could boost demand for other assets, including cryptocurrencies.""Japanese stocks tend to benefit from a weaker yen due to the export link, a stronger yen will make Japanese stocks less attractive to foreigners as well as to locals. This might increase the interest in alternative investments – such as BTC,"" Thielen wrote in a note shared with CoinDesk.With the BOJ hinting at a potential hawkish shift with the YCC tweak and the Fed tightening priced to a large extent, the path of least resistance for the yen appears to be on the higher side.""This year was a perfect storm for USD/JPY, as the Fed's hiking cycle combined with the Bank of Japan's insanely easy monetary policy resulted in a 32% move from trough to peak. I believe next year we will see a start of a Fed easing cycle and the start of the BOJ's tightening cycle, creating another perfect storm to the downside,"" Geoffrey Chen, global macro investor and founder of the Huang Chen Foundation, said in a Substack post.The odds, therefore, appears stacked in favor of bitcoin maintaining its direct correlation with the Japanese yen.UPDATE (Dec. 20, 09:22 UTC): Adds section ""strong yen, a blessing in disguise for BTC.""",2022/12/20
86,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin heads lower into Asia hours, though some analysts wonder if the largest cryptocurrency might hold up better than stocks in an earnings recession.Insights: Taiwan's dreams of becoming a crypto hub remain elusive, despite the inevitable chatter that sprang up following a successful Taipei Blockchain Week.Bitcoin dropping into Asia trading hoursBy Bradley KeounBitcoin (BTC) was dropping in early Asia hours, down 2% over the past 24 hours, to around $16,439. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was also down about 2%. In a potentially unnerving development, bitcoin addresses tied to the defunct Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX suddenly became active.Trading was mostly anemic during U.S. hours, with equity markets starting to reflect nervousness over the potential for any drop-off in corporate earnings that might come with a recession. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.49%. The S&P 500 slid 0.90% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.49%.Crypto analysts are starting to wonder if bitcoin might hold up better than stocks if the economy turns down.""The muted beta in crypto aligns with the idea that crypto assets might be less susceptible to a drawdown in equities catalyzed by an earnings recession,"" FundStrat's Sean Farrell wrote Monday in a note to investors.According to the crypto hedge fund BitBull Capital, the $20,000 mark looms as a major resistance point for the bitcoin market. On the downside, the next point to watch would be the November low around $15,500.Taipei Blockchain Week was a success, but there are reasons Taiwan isn’t a crypto hubBy Sam ReynoldsAfter every successful crypto conference in Taipei, the narrative that Taiwan is the undiscovered blockchain hub of Asia invariably comes up. It never seems to have any legs.Taipei Blockchain Week, a conference put together by Taiwan-focused Bu Zhi Dao (a play on the Chinese term for ‘I don’t know’), wrapped up Saturday. Despite being put together at the last minute because of uncertainty around Covid rules, there were around 1,700 in attendance. It wasn’t quite the star-studded Asia Blockchain Summit, but the energy was optimistic, despite the bear market.It’s hard to say that about Taiwan’s prospects for becoming a blockchain hub. Back in 2018, then KMT-legislator Jason Hsu said Taiwan could become a “blockchain island.” This year, the Hong Kong-based investor Sora Ventures said it was moving its fund to Taiwan. But an attempt to create a Security Token Offering structure to allow crypto firms to raise money in a regulatory-friendly way never really took off, because of a low cap on the amount one can fundraise.While there are many digital nomads in the crypto industry in Taiwan, including projects that purport to be on the island, few are actually incorporated locally as the rules around capital formation make it too difficult. Many business cards given out at Taipei Blockchain Week carried addresses in Singapore, Hong Kong and BVI.“Rarely is Taiwan the place to incorporate a start-up company's parent,” Ross Feingold, special counsel at Taipei-based Titan Attorneys at Law, told CoinDesk. “The traditional corporate structures are not start-up friendly because of limitations on a founder's services as payment for shares and limitations on share transfer restrictions among other issues, as well as the corporate governance requirements.”Authorities in Taiwan created a new company structure in 2015 that tried to address some of these issues but it's complex to understand, Feingold explained, especially for those who can’t read Chinese at the level of an accountant or lawyer.Those that do make the attempt to incorporate in Taiwan complain about the three to four months it takes; a company can be registered in Singapore in an average of 1.5 days and in less than 48 hours in Hong Kong. Both of those jurisdictions use common law, with a share structure more familiar to international investors, and they have more competitive tax regimes than Taiwan’s corporate tax rate and its withholding tax on dividends.At the height of COVID-19, Taiwan’s digital nomad friendly Gold Card, which allowed one to make the move provided they could prove they had an income of $67,000 or more, made things look appealing. Feingold says that’s only the case for digital nomads and freelancers.“The allure waned if the individual really needs to be in a place where the corporate headquarters is sited,” he said. “Some of the same issues that hinder Taiwan as a startup nation existed then and remain unchanged.”Feingold says that while Taiwan’s regulator, the Financial Supervisory Commission, has put in minimal restrictions for now, there’s always the “lingering risk that Taiwan's financial or tax authorities become more proactive in regulating the industry.”For what it’s worth, Thailand, another regional suitor, also has complicated and arcane company formation laws, even though Thailand’s Siam Commercial Bank, the most institutional of all investors in-country, actively invests and supports decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. That might help explain why Thai-based teams also incorporate elsewhere – much like those in Taiwan.11:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(3:00 UTC) Bank of Japan Interest Rate Decision9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Canada Retail Sales (MoM/Oct)11:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(15:00 UTC) Eurozone Consumer Confidence (Dec) In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Sam Bankman-Fried Reportedly Expected to Accept US Extradition; Bitcoin Remains in Tight RangeFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has reportedly had a change of heart and won't contest U.S. extradition.

87,"Kazakh legislators approved a bill last week that will introduce corporate tax for bitcoin miners as well as restrictions for the industry’s energy consumption nationwide.The law, dubbed “On Regulating Digital Assets in Kazakhstan,” was one of three pieces of crypto-related legislation approved by the country’s lower house, known as the Mazhilis, last Thursday, according to the parliament website. The bill now heads to the Senate for discussion and another round of voting. The legislation came to the table only in recent months, but the central Asian nation had been struggling with power shortages since at least fall 2021.If the Senate also approves the bill, the president has to sign it for it to become law. The Senate might vote on amendments, in which case the bill will be sent back to the Mazhilis.Kazakhstan saw a massive influx of crypto miners from neighboring China after Beijing banned the industry in May 2021. At that time China was the world’s largest bitcoin mining hub.It didn’t take long before Kazakhstan’s electrical grid, much of it a legacy of Soviet times, started crumbling under the new load. On top of the miners’ demand, technical failures in interconnection lines and power stations greatly exacerbated the situation, such that Kazakhstan, which until 2021 was a net power exporter, now sometimes imports energy from Russia.Read more: Kazakhstan’s Crypto Miners Face New Regulations After Contributing to Power ShortagesKazakhstan’s grid operator, KEGOC, cut off electricity to crypto mines in January for several months, while a campaign to crack down on illegal mining has been ongoing.CoinDesk learned about details of the legislation from people who are involved in the discussions and in local media.According to current discussions, the bill will allocate about 500 megawatts (MW) to miners. On top of that, miners that have registered with the government will only be able to buy power from the grid when there is an excess.The guaranteed volume is small compared to Kazakhstan’s total mining industry. Officials estimate around 1,000 MW-1,200 MW of electricity is consumed by crypto miners in Kazakhstan.The 500 MW cap is essentially a guarantee to miners that not all operations will be shut down, said Azamat Akhmetzhanov, press secretary of the Kazakhstan Association of Blockchain Technologies, a local industry group. But it simply isn’t enough – even as many miners have already left the country – said Didar Bekbau, founder of local mining firm Xive.io.This solution might solve Kazakhstan’s energy problems and power outages, but it remains to be seen exactly how the surplus will be calculated, Akhmetzhanov said.“Maybe the energy industry must change, because now the government regulates tariffs and doesn't create incentives for building new power generation organically,” Bekbau said.Those that are connected to renewable energy providers may not be subject to the requirement of only buying when there is a surplus, said Bekbau.Under the new law, miners will also only be able to buy grid power from KOREM, a state-owned enterprise that administers the day-ahead energy markets, according to local media site reports. In day-ahead markets, energy is traded for delivery within the next 24 hours of any given time. Miners will be able to buy in free market conditions on KOREM at wholesale prices, without any price restrictions or controls, local media reported.Crucially, the bill enshrines that miners have to pay corporate tax. Preferential taxation benefits that some could enjoy as high-tech firms in a special economic zone have already been withdrawn, said Akhmetzhanov and Bekbau.President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev signed into law a tax hike for miners' electricity usage in August, which is set to take effect at the start of 2023. The bill doesn’t change this hike, but it ensures that miners pay corporate taxes and can’t use the special economic zone to avoid an increased rate.It looks like miners will have to pay double tax, making them less competitive globally, Bekbau said, who thinks that the electricity tax should be eliminated. The blockchain association's press secretary however believes that the bill just ensures that the corporate tax will be ""calculated in more detail.""Miners might also be forced to sell three-quarters of their mined crypto locally through government-approved exchanges, starting in 2024. For Bekbau, that is not great news for the miners.The “liquidity problem shouldn't be solved at the expense of miners,” who should be able to choose where to sell their coins, he said.But Akhmetzhanov thinks that it might be good news for Kazakhstan. Once the exchanges receive liquidity, “With good management and a far-sighted strategy, they will be able to enter the top 30 trading platforms in the world,” the press secretary said.“The government wants more control and taxes,” said Bekbau, adding that the legislation could bring miners’ costs to 26 Kazakh tenge per kilowatt hour (kWh), roughly $0.055/kWh. That price is relatively competitive internationally, but in a crypto winter that has already caused the mining industry to be reeling in pain, it will likely send many miners underwater.The law also stipulates two new licensing categories; one is for miners that own and operate infrastructure, and one for those that simply host their mining machines in facilities run by other companies, local media reported.All in all, the new legislation might discourage investors. Already, “trust is shaken, many investors left Kazakhstan and canceled expansion plans,” Bekbau said.Read more: Kazakhstan’s Crypto Miners Face New Regulations After Contributing to Power Shortages",2022/12/19
88,"Andrei Lugovoi, the Russian parliament's chief crypto expert, may be connected to a cash over-the-counter (OTC) network located in Moscow, according to Dossier, a Russian media outlet that published an investigation on Monday.According to Dossier, an OTC called Bankoff is operating from an office owned by a company directed by Lugovoi's wife, Ksenia. Bankoff appears to be the most active trader on Binance's peer-to-peer marketplace for deals with Russian ruble, with the highest daily trading volumes, according to Dossier's research. The almost non-existent know-your-customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) procedures allow users to buy and sell crypto via Bankoff without revealing their identity, Dossier said. (An OTC is a broker-dealer as opposed to a centralized exchange.)To close a deal with Bankoff, one must go to the Federation Tower of the fancy Moscow City business district in Russia's capital, and bring cash to the office. According to documents from Russia's property registry, the office space belongs to a company named Bratsk Electric Networks. It is owned by three people, of which Ksenia Lugovaya's share is 22.5%, according to Russia's business ownership database. (CoinDesk independently reviewed the records.)It's not clear whether Bratsk Electric Networks owns the OTC operating from its office space or renting it out. However, the same company owns a crypto mining farm in the Russian city of Bratsk, according to local media. Bratsk, located in the heart of Siberia right by the Bratsk hydro power plant, became one of the favorite locations for miners due to its cold climate and abundance of cheap electricity.Read more: Bitcoin Mining Farms Are Flourishing on the Ruins of Soviet Industry in SiberiaAndrei Lugovoi is a member of the Liberal Democratic Party's fraction in the Russian parliament, the State Duma, and also a deputy chair of the Security and Corruption Prevention Committee.

89,"More than 100 bitcoins tied to the defunct Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX were transferred out of cold wallets thought to be beyond anyone’s control over the weekend, after sitting dormant for more than three years. The company's bankruptcy trustee, Ernst and Young, did not initiate the transfers, CoinDesk has learned.QuadrigaCX went bankrupt in 2019 after the apparent death of founder and CEO Gerald Cotten. At the time of its collapse, Quadriga was believed to have owed thousands of customers nearly $200 million in various cryptocurrencies – a staggering failure for what was once Canada’s largest crypto exchange.EY, which is acting as the trustee for Quadriga’s estate, announced in February 2019 that it lost control of about 100 BTC after mistakenly sending the coins to Quadriga-operated cold wallets that the Big Four financial services firm said it couldn’t access. At the time, the bitcoin was worth around $355,000 (C$470,000).The bitcoin in these addresses remained frozen until last Friday, when the coins in all five addresses left between 6:52 p.m. ET and 7:14 p.m. ET.Magdalena Gronowska, a bankruptcy inspector and member of Quadriga's creditor committee, said the funds were not moved by EY.In total, 104.34 BTC worth around $1.7 million (C$2.4 million) at press time has left Quadriga’s wallets. Many of these funds appear to have been distributed to different wallets.The amounts sent from each wallet match the amounts sent to those wallets in 2019. The wallets in question are:Blockchain sleuth zachxbt said on Twitter that the majority of these funds, nearly 70 BTC, appear to have gone to Wasabi, a coin mixing service. It is unclear why EY, a well-established financial services institution, might want to use a crypto mixing service, whose primary purpose would be to obfuscate the source and destination of funds.""Bankruptcy Inspectors are aware Quadriga funds have moved. Thank you to blockchain investigators for following flows, we're working to gather more information and I hope we are able to recover stolen funds,"" Gronowska said.A spokesperson for EY and an attorney with Miller Thomson, which represents Quadriga's creditors, did not return requests for comment.In early reports, EY said that Cotten, as the sole proprietor of Quadriga in its waning days, was the only person who could access its funds. Investigators claimed that Cotten did not maintain clear records, part of why the effort to recover customer funds is dragging into a fourth year.The Canada Revenue Agency, the nation’s tax enforcer, is also investigating the exchange and whether or not it filed its taxes appropriately while it still operated. A person familiar with the matter said the CRA investigation was the main issue preventing the bankruptcy proceedings from continuing.UPDATE (Dec. 19, 2022, 22:20 UTC): Adds additional detail.UPDATE (Dec. 19, 20:50 UTC): Adds additional detail and confirmation that EY did not move the funds out of the wallets.",2022/12/19

Equity markets also kicked off the new week with losses as traders felt the continuing nervousness over the Federal Reserve’s hawkish message last week on tighter monetary policy until it is ""sufficiently restrictive"" to bring inflation down. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.49%. The S&P 500 slid 0.90% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.49%.Ether (ETH): The second-largest cryptocurrency followed BTC’s trajectory, also dropping around 0.5% to $1,170.Filecoin (FIL) and Storj (STORJ): FIL is down 28% over the past five days, with STORJ down 20%. Data from Coinglass points to record liquidations on long positions for storage protocols' tokens: Nearly $5.7 million long FIL positions were liquidated on Dec. 16, according to Coinglass, while $365,000 in STORJ long positions were also liquidated.By Glenn Williams Jr.Bitcoin’s correlation with copper has been interesting to track, rising as high as 0.9 a week ago.

91,"Over recent weeks we’ve made a point of highlighting bitcoin (BTC) and ether’s (ETH) correlations with different assets, and the extent to which they’ve sustained or changed over time.That process, often referred to as intermarket analysis, aims to give insight into how one asset price might move, based on factors that impact another.The measuring stick is the correlation coefficient, ranging from -1 to 1. A coefficient of 1 implies a direct pricing relationship, with a coefficient of -1 indicates a completely inverse relationship.Bitcoin and ether, despite the differences in their blockchain consensus mechanisms, total supply and utility, have enjoyed a persistently strong pricing relationship, with a correlation coefficient above 0.9 for all of November and most of December. The coefficient now sits at 0.85, still extremely strong.Other correlations we’ve been tracking include bitcoin’s relationships to equities, metals, energy and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY):What stands out besides BTC’s reliable correlation to ETH is the persistently inverse relationship to the DXY.The 0.84 reading on Nov. 19 appears to be an outlier. BTC held an inverse pricing relationship with the DXY for the better part of 2022, turning positive between Nov. 9 and Nov. 27, but largely related to the FTX collapse.For traders, the consistently positive relationship between BTC and ETH, and the equally consistent inverse relationship between BTC and DXY, presents an opportunity should those correlations stray from their norms.While BTC appears poised to trade flat for the time being, a deviation in the relationship can be an opportunity – because correlations typically revert to their mean.Bitcoin’s correlation with copper has been interesting to track, rising as high as 0.9 a week ago.

92,"Price crashes and crypto collapses dominated headlines in 2022, but it was a year of significant progress for Bitcoin. In 2022, we saw how Bitcoin as a protocol allows for widespread innovation that fills whatever needs developers and entrepreneurs identify without any need for changes to that protocol. We’ve highlighted 10 important developments below.The greatest achievement in Bitcoin this year was, once again, Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin continued to operate flawlessly, with one block coming roughly every 10 minutes and its coin issuance precisely adhering to what was set out in Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper in 2008. There were no emergency restarts, no hard forks, no chain splits and no protocol-level hacks or bugs. Yet again, Bitcoin delivered 100% uptime and was available to anyone in the world all year in the face of everything 2022 threw at it. Billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin were transferred every single day on its blockchain.Bitcoin did all this without any foundation supporting it, without any direct employees, without any leaders or venture capitalists. As such, ongoing developments that rely on Bitcoin’s reliability and predictability were able to proceed with uninterrupted focus for yet another year and with the confidence that they’ll be able to do so for the foreseeable future.It is worth noting that none of the remaining items on this list require any changes to Bitcoin’s base layer consensus rules.While Bitcoin’s base layer remains rock steady, its most significant scaling protocol, the Lightning Network, experienced massive growth and development in 2022. Lightning Network allows for instant, cheap payments off-chain, eliminating the need to wait for a block to confirm transactions. It is entirely decentralized and permissionless and improves Bitcoin’s scalability while still leveraging the security and settlement assurances of Bitcoin’s base layer. The network’s publicly visible liquidity capacity rose from 1,058 BTC to more than 4,771 BTC in 2022.The number of Lightning Network channels rose by +80%, from 37,298 to 67,339 channels.The number of publicly visible Lightning Network nodes increased by +88%, from 8,295 to 15,636 nodes (though the rate of growth slowed in the second half).All told, the growth of the Lightning Network was astounding this year, driven by numerous wallets that were launched, better tools for users that were built, and more educational resources that were produced. Instant, cheap payments (typically under 1 U.S. cent) became widespread in 2022 as Bitcoiners looked to exchange value peer-to-peer over the Lightning Network.In 2022, El Salvador experienced the greatest country rebrand in history under President Nayib Bukele’s policy of economic liberty and Bitcoin. Bukele appeared on the cover of Bitcoin Magazine's year-end edition, which showed the president looking like the Founding Father of hyperbitcoinization, the first mover and the leader who dared to embrace Bitcoin-only and the economic liberty it offered to his people.Read more: What Is Bitcoin's Lightning Network? In the column, Bukele called for all Bitcoiners around the world to recognize that El Salvador's fight against the global elites is their fight, too. El Salvador’s embracement of the bitcoin currency made clear to all that it understands exactly what revolutionary money actually is, despite the FUD from mainstream media. While U.S. regulators and political elites got taken in by the likes of Sam Bankman-Fried, bitcoin led to boom times in El Salvador. Tourism numbers have skyrocketed, GDP is growing and the country keeps stacking sats.October saw the creation by El Salvador of the world's first “Bitcoin Embassy” in Lugano. This chamber of commerce will be headed by Salvadoran bitcoin miner and investor turned Bitcoin diplomat and “Honorary Consul” Josue Lopez. November saw the creation of the Bitcoin Office within the Office of the El Salvadoran President. The office was created to meet the growing demand for access and information from investors worldwide. The Bitcoin Office further establishes the El Salvador template for more nations to copy on the road to hyperbitcoinization. El Salvador closed out the year in the most bitcoin way of all – with President Bukele announcing that El Salvador would start buying one bitcoin every single day.This new service was coded in a few weeks by African developer, Kgothatso Ngako, who noticed a problem – most Africans have basic phones but don’t have access to a reliable internet connection – so he created a solution. Machankura enables people in Africa to receive and spend bitcoin via text messages without needing an internet connection. In a report from Caribou, 94% of financial transactions in Africa are made through text messages, and only 6% of these transactions are made via mobile apps. ​​This new service allows individuals throughout Africa to use bitcoin for the first time on technology that is already at their disposal. Projects like Machankura will help push bitcoin adoption in regions that need digital sound money the most.This year, Lightning Labs introduced a protocol proposal to Bitcoin and the Lightning Network that aims to allow for the minting, sending and receiving of assets on the networks. Taro utilizes Bitcoin’s latest protocol upgrade, Taproot, to enable the issuance of theoretically any kind of asset on the Bitcoin blockchain while still using the immutable verification of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Taro could allow for all kinds of assets like stablecoins, stocks, and bonds to be issued on top of the Bitcoin protocol opening the door for more use cases and more functionality on the network.Impervious Technologies launched the first web browser built on top of Bitcoin’s second-layer scaling system, the Lightning Network. It is a peer-to-peer web browser that offers a full suite of tools for communication, data transfers,and Lightning payments without any middlemen. This comes in the form of secure peer-to-peer messaging, P2P video calls, P2P workspaces, decentralized identity management, decentralized data storage and direct user monetization of their data. All of these tools are fully encrypted, and they remove centralized intermediaries that collect and sell the user’s data. By utilizing the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin and Lightning networks, Impervious Technologies has given us a hint of what the Internet will look like in the future.FediMint is a new method to custody bitcoin by forming collaborative custody communities to help secure each others’ bitcoin and protect privacy. This form of custody takes advantage of the inherent fact that humans trust those closest to them the most. It leverages technologies like federations and (David) Chaumian e-cash mints to cryptographically maintain privacy between the individuals of a group while also allowing them to share custody of the entire group’s bitcoin. This custody solution offers the possibility to scale bitcoin, improve privacy, lower on-chain fees and can get more individuals to take self-custody of their bitcoin around the world.Value-4-Value is a new approach to content publishing where the creator receives value after the “customer” enjoys the content, once again, through the Lightning Network. Over 10,000 content creators have already implemented Value-4-Value on their podcasts, and solutions such as LightningAddresses and Bolt-12 invoices, are making this possible for all other types of content, promising continued rapid growth in 2023.An informal Telegram group of ordinary people interested in running their own Lightning nodes formed and is about to cross over 5,800 members.Not only do participants provide support to each other on best practices, but community members have developed and released numerous open-source applications to make some of the most advanced capabilities of Lightning Network easily accessible to anyone. sdLightning Terminal is a browser-based interface for managing channel liquidity on self-hosted Lightning nodes, performing submarine swaps via the Lightning Loop service, classifying channels and integrating loopd, poold, and faraday daemon. Balance of satoshis makes it easy to balance channels, making it easy to issue lightning transactions that balance channels' inbound and outbound liquidity. LNDg and Lightning Jet offer similar capabilities with more advanced features for monitoring nodes and maximizing efficiency.All over the world, people live with very little, very expensive or no electricity. Bitcoin mining is changing all this. One example, shared by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, was powering a rural Kenyan village while securing the Bitcoin network with excess hydropower, all while lowering rates to 2,000 people (500 families) by approximately $10 a month to only $4.Far from being an isolated example, a further $2 million in the financing, led by Stillmark VC and Block, was secured in December to use bitcoin mining to increase energy access across Africa while further distributing and securing the Bitcoin network.",2022/12/19
93,"In the aftermath of cryptocurrency exchange FTX’s collapse last month, questions have swirled throughout the industry about whether other large players’ finances can be trusted. With professional auditors now abruptly exiting the space, those questions may keep lingering.Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, sought to tamp down worries raised by rival FTX’s rapid descent into bankruptcy court by announcing it would release proof-of-reserves data. While not conventional audits, such reports describe how much crypto an exchange is holding – an attempt to allay fears about the whereabouts of customers’ money.The Binance proof-of-reserves report did come out – only to be withdrawn Friday when the auditing firm it had hired, Mazars, announced it was no longer working with crypto firms. Mazars had also been working with Crypto.com and KuCoin.Mazars was one of a few auditors (along with Grant Thornton and BDO) working with unregulated and private companies in the crypto industry to assure transparency. Now even the French auditor has cold feet.“I’m quite surprised the public and regulators are finally discovering that their favorite centralized exchanges [CEX] have incredibly complicated layers of corporate structures and, as we’re finding out, un-auditable books,” said Joseph Collement, general counsel at Bitcoin.com.Mazars, in an email to CoinDesk, said it was pausing work with crypto clients globally due to “concerns regarding the way these reports are understood by the public.”Binance and many other crypto firms are privately held, meaning they don’t regularly – if ever – release financial data. So the short-lived proof-of-reserves information was welcomed by the industry.The now-withdrawn reports published by Binance and Crypto.com were often misunderstood as actual audits, that is unbiased examinations and evaluation of the financial statements of an organization. But they’re really just a matching exercise that involves mapping customer assets as recorded in an exchange’s internal database to entries in a public blockchain, according to Francine McKenna, a lecturer in financial accounting at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.This led to confusion in the industry and the assumption that those exchanges indeed had all the assets they said they had – which isn’t necessarily the case, because the exchange could have cherry-picked the assets that were checked by the auditor.In theory, it’s easy to audit proof of reserves, Collement said. “When a crypto asset is deposited onto an account earmarked for a specific user, the CEX should hold that asset 1:1 on behalf of the user.”However, very few CEXs adhere to those procedures, he said. “Once commingling of customers’ funds together or customer’s and company’s funds occurs, audits become extremely more difficult.”This is also because assets could be held in other cryptocurrencies as opposed to U.S. dollars, which adds another layer of complexity. In addition to that, “proof of reserves mean very little without proof of liabilities,” he said.This is a problem, because while these reports prove there are assets to support the market value of various stablecoins or reserves to back up customer assets, they don’t consider the creditworthiness of borrowers for loans that are included as assets. They also don’t identify and value obligations the stablecoin issuer or exchange may have to others that could wipe out the value of those assets.“Choosing to do any work, especially an actual audit, with crypto-adjacent firms is very high risk,” McKenna said. “I am not sure these firms fully assessed the risks of acceptance and continuance of these relationships to their reputation and legal liability.”Crypto companies for a long time have promised customers to publish audits regularly to provide a sense of security and transparency. Few have actually kept their promise, and most have argued that it is simply too difficult to find an auditor to work with.“Mazars is trying to reduce its risk profile,” said RA Wilson, chief technology officer of 1GCX. “Its team probably discovered that they’re understaffed and not as knowledgeable about the crypto industry as they need to be to conduct a comprehensive audit.”Mazars’ departure doesn’t mean, however, that conventional auditors cannot examine the books at crypto firms. Coinbase is a publicly traded company in the U.S., and so – as it must – the company releases full-fledged reports about its finances, audited by one of the largest accounting firms in the world: Deloitte.Top accounting firms like Deloitte “prefer to work with large pre-IPO or public firms,” McKenna said. “Partners who want to do something new or more risky are usually held back by lots of layers of checks and balances that manage liability for the firm.”Firms like Mazar or Grant Thornton, or Tether’s auditor BDO Milan, on the other hand, have seen an opportunity to carve out a niche in a new industry, she said.“I think this ‘pause’ by Mazars … will create a chilling effect,” McKenna said. “The fact that FTX had any audits means someone is starting to ask for more assurances. That has now grown to a very loud cry, and I doubt the Big Four [accounting] firms will step in and fill the void.”",2022/12/19
94,"Since 2016 I have ended each year with predictions for the blockchain ecosystem for the year ahead. 2022 has been one of the most tumultuous years in crypto, with a litany of decentralized and centralized entities already evaporated or on their last leg. It feels like we are in the final convulsions of a nascent ecosystem, expelling bad actors and bad practices in a dramatic but ultimately maturing process. Here’s what we’ll see on the other side.Andrew Keys is a venture capitalist and managing partner of DARMA Capital, a Commodity Futures Trading Commission-registered commodity pool operator and commodity trading adviser focused on quantitative systematic alpha of Web3 protocols. Prior to DARMA Capital, he was global head of business development for ConsenSys.When we look back at 2022 in 10 years, the real news wasn’t the idiocy of Sam Bankman-Fried and Celsius Network; it was that Ethereum shipped proof-of-stake and continues to be the most ubiquitous layer 1. A series of protocol-level developments has created a vortex of innovation, development, users and capital. In Ethereum we are witnessing the evolution of the substrate of humanity’s social, economic and political operating system.In 2023, Ethereum will continue to be the most widely adopted, widely developed and capital-heavy layer 1 blockchain. The Merge was the greatest event in the industry since Satoshi’s Bitcoin Genesis Block in 2009. More nuanced but equally important developments will launch on Ethereum in 2023, driving greater adoption and capital in a flywheel effect that will situate Ethereum as the leader in the next bull run.The next Ethereum upgrade after the Merge is Shanghai, planned for the second quarter of 2023. Among many upgrades Shanghai will enable withdrawals of ether (ETH) stakes, which have been locked in the deposit contract since staking was enabled in December 2020. The ability to un-stake ETH could increase the amount of staked ETH as stakers, who were uneasy with the idea of locking funds, come on board.Following the Shanghai upgrade, EIP-4844 is another Ethereum innovation that will further situate Ethereum as the most ubiquitous layer 1. EIP-4844 will enable proto-danksharding. Proto-danksharding is proposed as a step along the way to full sharding, and will help layer 2s scale. Danksharding is a sharding design that uses a “merged market fee” in which each shard has different blocks, but shares one block proposer.Read more: What Is Sharding?EIP-4844 is a proposal to start implementing elements of danksharding as the full danksharding design is still being developed. Though no longer in the Shanghai update, I predict proto-danksharding will be accepted and implemented in 2023, setting the stage for rapid development towards full sharding and maximum Ethereum scalability.After a smooth transition to proof-of-stake, Ethereum’s utility as a platform for staking innovation will continue to expand, creating a new compounding crypto yield curve.Following Ethereum’s successful migration to proof-of-stake in September, ETH is now the largest staked capital base of any blockchain, with more than $20 billion staked. Prior to the Merge, we saw innovation in the realm of staking through projects like Lido, which enables liquid staking, and Obol, which provides distributed validator technology.In 2023, we will see continued innovation in ETH staking as capital seeks more secure forms of yield and future updates enable stake withdrawals. EigenLayer is a particularly innovative staking project. EigenLayer provides crypto-economic “security as a service” to rollups, bridges and oracles. EigenLayer allows these projects to leverage Ethereum’s staked security to supplement or complement the security provided by a native token. In 2023, EigenLayer plans to launch its re-staking protocol and the first middleware using the re-staking mechanism, called EigenDA (Data Availability).An increase in ETH staking in 2023 will engender demand for more nuanced utility from validators, stakers, and projects built on Ethereum. Staking innovations like EigenLayer and others will continue funneling utility and capital into the Ethereum base layer, creating a flywheel of adoption and utility that will continue to establish Ethereum as the global settlement layer for Web3.The Fed will turn dovish, setting the stage for the next crypto bull market in Q3 2023.I predict the U.S. Federal Reserve will pivot away from its hawkish policy and stop raising interest rates by the second quarter of 2023. As we see credit card debt at notable highs and savings at notable lows, I anticipate we will see macroeconomic indicators like Brent crude oil fall to $60 – early 2021 levels – and shipping container rates fall below $2,000, which hasn’t happened since before COVID-19. Both of these signals indicate an economy in need of jump-starting, which will convince the Fed to ease off the interest rate hikes. This will engender a risk-on environment, incentivizing capital flows into more innovative industries like crypto. By this time, I also predict sufficient regulatory progress will be made in the crypto industry, meaning that the risk-on environment will be accompanied by clearer policies. Altogether, this will engender the next bull run beginning in Q3 2023.Washington, D.C., will be a crypto hotspot in 2023 as regulatory innovation proceeds at unprecedented rates.The centralized finance disasters of 2022 were the result of poor risk management, insufficient governance, incomplete audits, and potential fraud – all of which could have happened in any industry. Consumer protection will be top of mind for policymakers in 2023. The majority of emerging policy will be around centralized exchanges and stablecoins. Exchanges like Coinbase may be forced to be G-SIFI-regulated institutions, which will increase their regulatory compliance costs. Washington, D.C., will be the hotbed of some of the most controversial and important conversations about crypto in 2023.During this increase in regulatory attention, the Securities and Exchange Commission will continue to declare that all tokens are unregistered securities, which is categorically untrue. Just because this new database technology is able to digitize and tokenize any asset doesn’t mean all such assets are securities. We will see tokens representing everything: an electron on a microgrid, a bar of gold, a carbon offset credit, a software license, a governance right, a concert ticket, a doctor’s prescription, a meme that got very popular in 2010 and then everyone forgot, a fiat currency, and a reward point – none of which should rationally be lumped under securities. That isn’t consumer protection, [SEC chief] Gary Gensler, it’s willful ignorance of new technologies.If the U.S. rushes through poorly designed legislation under the guise of consumer protection, we will lose Web3 to the rest of the world – unlike how the U.S. won the Web2 revolution. A regulatory ontology should be defined to help everyone in the space determine whether a specific token should be classified as a commodity, security, or other type of asset.Banks chartered by the Federal Reserve will offer crypto services.The Financial Stability Oversight Council aims to further evolve regulations to protect consumers and enable greater technology innovation in an effort to build more robust and secure global platforms.An example of this is VaultLink, whose Digital Value Transfer Rail enables banks to offer crypto-asset services (custody, staking, exchange), digital value transfers and real-time payments in a regulatory-compliant manner with true supervisory oversight. VaultLink’s 2023 plans are to continue serving as a leading voice on the Federal Reserve’s Working Group while collaborating with the banking agencies to enable crypto services.NFT utility will grow more nuanced, personalized and commercial as we collectively move past the “jpeg” era. At the same time, blue chip “jpeg” NFTs will be a multi-billion-dollar asset class.In 2023, the Web3 ecosystem will move past the “jpeg” era of non-fungible tokens that dominated the last two years, represented by 10,000 pfp projects and zero-utility art. The term “NFT” will no longer automatically mean “digital art” as it has, since a variety of use cases will emerge, all using NFTs as the base technology.Already commercial behemoths like Starbucks are exploring alternative use cases of NFTs. Many more commercial leaders are watching how Starbucks will unfold; if successful, we will see a big bang of major brands releasing NFT rewards points. Web3-native projects such as Mojito have started this evolution, and are already powering both brands and creators that want to explore more personalized utility of NFTs. 2023 will also be the rise of “phygital” where a teenager who purchases a physical pair of Nikes will also have a digital receipt of those sneakers to be digitally worn on their avatar in the metaverse.This rapid evolution in the true utility of NFTs will force the crypto community to look back critically on the projects of 2021 and 2022. If they haven’t failed already, the vast majority of remaining NFT projects that haven’t evolved utility will join the NFT graveyard. What we’ll find remaining will be the blue chip NFTs that have been acknowledged but largely ignored in the last year – the CryptoPunks of the world.Investment DAOs will grow in prominence as decentralized, secure and transparent alternatives to investing through GP/LP venture structures.Investment decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) will grow in number and in prominence as transparent, auditable, and collaborative vehicles to deploy and allocate capital. Investment DAOs will force a shift in the mindset of financial decision making; instead of relying on the opinions of a few experts, these DAOs will operate based on the consensus of their global memberships via a “wisdom of the curated crowd.” As agile, on-chain entities, these investment DAOs will be some of the earliest players in high-potential investment opportunities, leveling the playing field for the average investor.Tribute Labs is an investment DAO building machine whose current network consists of 16 investment DAOs ranging across the Web3 landscape with assets under management of over $1 billion. These DAOs have set frameworks that will serve as blueprints for the emerging set of investments DAOs in 2023. Each DAO is limited to 99 members, striking a balance between a diversity of members and the relative ability to make quick decisions and allocate capital efficiently. Tribute Labs will introduce more DAOs in 2023 (AI, DeSci, Urbit and more), continuing to establish best practices and grow the impact of investment DAOs.Read more: 2023 Will Be the Year of Dapps – Here's What to ExpectFilecoin becomes a fully fledged layer 1 protocol in its own right, paving the way for the world’s largest decentralized data economy.In 2020, I predicted that IPFS and Filecoin would step into the global spotlight as a viable decentralized solution for data storage. Two years on, the Filecoin network has indeed expanded at breakneck pace, amassing an incredible amount of hardware to the network. It is now the largest decentralized storage network on Earth. More than 4,000 storage providers contribute ~16 exbibyte (EIB) of storage capacity. Client data stored on the network is up 15 times, year to date. That’s enough to store the entire Internet Archive 275 times over. That said, to be competitive with the centralized cloud, Filecoin will need to grow more than 10 times from here – still a long way to go, but a credible path.The vision for Filecoin has always been larger than storage. The project’s community has a steadfast commitment to the mammoth ambition of building the decentralized infrastructure required to enable programmable storage (via smart contracts), retrieval and large scale computation of data. In other words, Filecoin is enabling open services for data.The protocol is releasing smart contracts in Q1 2023 through the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), a critical on-chain upgrade which will allow it to come into its own as a fully fledged layer 1 protocol. The FVM will enhance the sophistication of Filecoin’s storage services while unlocking a whole new universe of use cases for the Web3 space. To date, other layer 1 smart contracts have focused on a few use cases: decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, gaming and so on. What makes smart contracts on Filecoin unique is the ability to pair these Web3 offerings with real world services like storage and compute, provided by an open market. I expect the Web3 space to eagerly anticipate the “coming of age” of Filecoin and explore building natively on the protocol next year.Reputation will re-emerge as a fundamental innovation in Web3 as a multitude of reputation projects launch.In 2023, years of progress on the decentralized identity and reputation front will finally come to a head. These systems will start to become critical pieces of infrastructure underpinning most of our interactions and transactions, especially in Web3. Soon you will be able to take your flawless reputation built on one application and apply it towards another. Decentralized identity and reputation systems make this possible by taking a more holistic approach to identity through platform-agnostic, user-centric data aggregation.Projects like Intuition are pushing the boundaries on the identity front – by incentivizing the attestation of interesting data points and incorporating these attestations into the “identity” derivation processes, Intuition is able to provide a more comprehensive view of “who” and “what” things are. This is essential in enabling humans to coordinate on a decentralized global scale.Prepare for the rise of “ZK everything” as privacy technology emerges from academic proofs-of-concept to usable, scalable technology.Zero-knowledge proofs rose to prominence in the past year, with one use case, ZK-Rollups, gaining visibility as the dominant tool for Ethereum scaling. In 2023, a much broader set of use cases will be unlocked by adoption of software development kits (SDK) that allow ZK smart contracts to be programmed into applications (“ZKApps”), executed off-chain, with verification and settlement back on-chain. Off-chain execution opens up a whole new world for data privacy and attestation, and efficiency. It will start to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, and will enable new identity use cases, social networking, voting, games and zkML.The lynchpin to the success of ZK in 2023 is access to existing Web3 devs. O(1) Labs – company behind the first succinct ZK-based layer 1 MINA – launched an SDK that will better enable the development of in-browser ZKApps in the year to come. These sorts of developments from 2022 will mean that in 2023 ZK will move from the world of academia and testnets into daily Web3 life. Moreover, teams like Matter Labs will roll out zkSync2.0 which is a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine that supports Solidity, Vyper and account abstraction.The zero-knowledge proving market will be larger than bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) market by 2030.Cosmos gets interesting as developers and users seek more customization. Appchains will also go live on Ethereum.In 2023, the “Cosmos vision” will finally find mass adoption. Cosmos is not a blockchain but a ‘“galaxy” of interconnected chains. Importantly, all of the chains employ the inter-blockchain communication (IBC) standard, a technology designed to mimic the early innovations of TCP/IP layer in Web2. For nefarious hackers, bridges have represented the most lucrative attack vector, totaling a whopping US$2.5 billion since 2020. Having a standard communication layer just makes sense.Moreover, as blockchains have matured in application, developers will be forced to welcome and own more of the blockchain stack. We will see a range of customizations. How much security does your chain want or need? Is it open for all developers? How about fees? Where do you want to be connected? The many chains approach makes these customizations possible and may unlock true product market fit.Appchains give developers the ability to customize execution environments in a way that smart contract platforms can’t support. The challenge is that appchains lose the shared security enjoyed by dapps. App-specific rollups (RollApps) get the best of both worlds and will be a big trend in 2023.Alongside the growth in Cosmos, however, we will see the rise of app-specific chains anchored by Ethereum. As the largest project in the blockchain ecosystem, Ethereum is able to take the best in open-source, and port it to the Ethereum community.Projects like Stackr Network are pioneering this wave of appchains through RollApps. Stackr offers a language-agnostic SDK for developers to customize optimistic rollups along with a decentralized sequencer network to run them in a trust-minimized way. The plan in 2023 is to build a developer alpha and onboard early projects. These projects will also help shape the design of the system through a closed feedback cycle.Bitcoin will face headwinds, continue to lose market share and will not lead the next bull market.Bitcoin will continue falling behind in the market as it succumbs to prevailing headwinds: primarily “pet rock” syndrome, environmental concerns and failure as “digital gold.”Bitcoin’s lack of daily utility will begin working against its favor as the rest of Web3 starts demonstrating real-world use cases. It will succumb to the “pet rock” syndrome, in which holding the asset won’t seem as attractive compared to directing capital to tokens and ecosystems with increasing commercial and enterprise use.Environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns will only rise with the macro-political and macro-environmental movement. Enterprises, individuals and governments will be under continued pressure to curb unnecessary energy consumption, and crypto is already under scrutiny. Environmental concerns are only one reason why Web3 prefers proof-of-stake, but it is a coincidence that will make PoS blockchains more resilient against ESG criticisms and regulation. Any remaining PoW chains must demonstrate clear utility to validate continued energy consumption. Bitcoin won’t transition to PoS and its utility will remain limited, setting it up to be the primary recipient of such criticism.Lastly, bitcoin had every chance to act as a risk-off digital gold-like hedge but failed to live up to that opportunity over several years. It acted like risk-on tech beta instead.Together, these three headwinds will put Bitcoin back even further in this bear market, setting the stage for another layer 1 with actual utility to lead the next bull run.Web3 gaming will move past its flawed, early projects and finally begin meeting gamers where they are.Web3 gaming has, for the most part, fallen short of its vision so far. The most “successful” Web3 games – for instance, Axie Infinity and DeFi Kingdoms – have been propped up as the future of gaming, but have failed to make an impression among the 3 billion gamers worldwide. In fact, Web3 gaming has received a bad reputation, characterized as little more than a money grab or DeFi with a veneer. This reputation has not been improved because Web3 gaming projects are highly connected to crypto markets.In 2023, Web3 gaming will shake off the habits of these earliest projects and start releasing projects that bring together the utility of Web3 and the aesthetics of traditional gaming. The next wave of Web3 games will look nothing like the Axie-style games of the last two years, and will begin resembling mainstream gaming aesthetics. Popular attention will shift away from token-first projects like Axie towards the studios, companies, and titles that have been building with a gameplay-first approach: Horizon, Animoca and others.As layer 1 protocols continue to undergo core developments in scalability and privacy, layer 2s will support the next wave of consumer-friendly applications.Despite breakneck innovation, the leading layer 1s still have sufficient protocol-layer development to undergo in order to support daily mass adoption of Web3 applications. Specifically, consumer requirements like scale, user experience (UX), confidentiality and security. The layer 2 ecosystem has been growing steadily over the past 18 months, with generalized networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism, and industry-specific networks including ImmutableX. The layer 2 ecosystem has had a couple of false starts but in 2023 we will see layer 2s come to the forefront of crypto adoption as they handle the wave of consumer applications coming to market. In particular, the nonfinancial applications like social media, gaming, and metaverses – which can reasonably prioritize scale over all else – will look towards layer 2s as the best solution to quickly launch in the market.Read more: Crypto 2023 – Full coverage Decentralized science (DeSci) will take center stage as another major use case of Web3, open-source collaboration and decentralized fundraising. DAOs will be at the forefront of the movement.In 2023, DeSci will turn scientific research into a Web3-native asset class through IP-NFTs (Intellectual Property NFTs), ushering a new age of scientific discovery comparable to the enormous breakthroughs witnessed in open source software development in the early 2000s. Fields like biotech will move from monopolistic innovation models to open-source, hyper-collaborative ecosystems where outcomes are more fundamentally aligned with patients and researchers.In 2022, organizations such as Molecule have brought IP from leading universities across the globe on-chain, financed and supported by novel decentralized biotech organizations, such as VitaDAO. VitaDAO is a BioDAO on Ethereum building a portfolio of longevity assets and working to bring these technologies to market in a community-driven way, like a FlamingoDAO for biotech. BioDAOs are communities that fund and incubate IP-NFTs, and are already seeing traction, with four new entities participating in a new accelerator program, bio.xyz.2023 will continue the rise of BioDAOs and IP-NFTs, as Fortune 500 organizations like Pfizer expand to cover more scientific fields and therapeutic areas.The remaining vaporware blockchains will finally lose their positions as “top” blockchains as even speculative money leaves their ecosystems.For years, vaporware blockchains like EOS and Cardano have remained among the “top” blockchains as measured by market cap (Cardano is in the top 10, EOS is in the top 40). These projects are still riding off of hype from their earliest days, having undergone almost no ecosystem development despite the breakneck innovation happening across the rest of Web3.In the current depth of the bear market, Ethereum is maintaining (roughly) $1 billion in volume every 24 hours. Compare that to Cardano’s ~$1M and EOS’ ~$100,000 daily volume. The bear market hasn’t been kind to any network, but EOS has the unique standing of being responsible for the greatest value destruction based on original fundraising against current value, at $4.2 billion lost. Neither chain is living up to the promises made to early consumers. In 2023, even pre-initial coin offering institutional investors and the earliest retail investors will lose interest. The death knell will toll for these vaporware blockchains as they finally lose the last remaining mainstream supporters under the undeniable lack of on-chain adoption.The growth in reputation projects, social networks, and decentralized identity will bring AML/KYC solutions down to the wallet level.In 2022, a number of tools emerged that explored the ideas of social networks, reputation, and decentralized identities. These projects included soulbound tokens, ENS, POAPs and Lens. This focus on reputation and identity will increase in 2023, alongside increased regulation and consumer protection for DeFi use (at least in the U.S.). Verifiable credentials will become the data standard for off-chain credentials and attestations, with a focus on free, cheap, and privacy-first options that can be selectively disclosed by users. Where will these solutions come to head? We will see the first iteration of scalable reputation systems built using tools such as MetaMask Snaps, DIDs and VCs.Prepare for more fallout.The turmoil we’ve seen in crypto since May 2022 isn’t over. There are still buried bodies to be found from the excesses and impulses of the past years. Many people and companies have succeeded in obfuscating their exposure, but won’t be able to do so for much longer. Ultimately good for the ecosystem, this will unfortunately mean more consumer money will be lost, more trust betrayed and greater outside criticism. Keep building for the future, but prepare for more fallout in the near term.In 2023, renewed attention will be paid to leading open-source development projects as a hedge against repeating past mistakes in crypto.2022 was a massively formative year for open-source, internet-native organizations. The breadth and scale of problems that the Web3 community chose to tackle using these new models grew by an order of magnitude, and the impact these organizations can make for everyday people is starting to become a major theme.As we’ve learned from cases like FTX, it’s far too easy for us to slip back into old habits and accidentally reinvent the same broken systems that centralize power rather than push it to the edges. In 2023, we’ll see more projects come to the conclusion that we need to take our own rhetoric seriously and start to make meaningful strides towards building open-source, community owned infrastructure; towards a world where digital public goods for any local online community can be provisioned in a mutualist way that strengthens trust rather than diminishing it or abstracting it. Two projects in particular will continue to define models of open-source funding and development: Gitcoin and Tea.xyz.Gitcoin – which has distributed over $72 million in grants – is launching a “grants suite” that will enable any group to seamlessly empower their community members to coordinate funding for projects that address their shared needs. The suite will consist of Passport – a zero-knowledge identity verification tool – and two new protocols: a funding allocation protocol and project registry protocol.Tea is a protocol that allows open-source developers to be remunerated for their contributions. Tea’s product suite includes a virtual environment manager, a universal interpreter, and a unified dependency manager. In the first month of launching its command-line interface, over 2,400 developers have starred in Tea's GitHub repository, making Tea’s community of over 16,000 developers one of the most rapidly growing groups on GitHub. In 2023, Tea will be building out its blockchain registry, license management and remuneration features.The media will abandon its search for gods and find rational voices in crypto.As major centralized finance (CeFi) and DeFi projects collapsed in the last year, so too did their founders and CEOs. These individuals had been ravenously propped up by the media, engendering misplaced trust by investors, companies and regulators. The media will need to face its misguided obsession with their crypto “gods” and seek out measured, rational voices in crypto. This will happen, slowly but surely, throughout 2023 as the true nature of more “gods” are revealed.Fortunately, these rational folks won’t be hard to find for those genuinely interested in reporting on the reality of crypto. These new and old voices – notably humbler than the ones of the last two years – are building for the long term, and should be at the forefront of how the media reports on the space.“Tech crypto” will become useful, replacing “money crypto” and setting the stage for the next bull market.In Bill Hughes’ November CoinDesk op-ed, he explains the difference between “tech crypto” and “money crypto.” Tech crypto is about “peer-to-peer computer networks where participants transact by interacting with globally accessible software.” Money crypto is about “buying, holding, lending and trading tokens as investable assets.”The past year has been dominated by money crypto in terms of popular adoption, regulatory attention, and consumer knowledge. Centralized exchanges have been the “beating heart” of money crypto, and the landscape of CeFi now has a microscope on it from regulators. The scrutinization of money crypto will result in the clarification of tech crypto as a related, but separate, field.Tech crypto in 2023 will become more and more useful through two trends: 1) the movement of capital from centralized to decentralized financial applications and 2) the rise of non-financial decentralized applications like DeSci, social media, consumer rewards and more. The result will be a growing foundation of Web3 (i.e., tech crypto) adoption rather than just token (i.e., money crypto) adoption. This will set the stage for the next bull market and help hedge against volatile market cycles in the future as more capital is kept in transparent financial applications rather than shadowy centralized alternatives.The “Great Decoupling” will accelerate, paving the way for stronger enterprise adoption of Ethereum.In 2023, we will see the “Great Decoupling” and the consequent acceleration of enterprise adoption of Ethereum. As explained by Paul Brody, the Great Decoupling is when “the value proposition of Ethereum as a computing platform for enterprises finally gets separated from the focus on the price of Ethereum and financial speculation.” The focus on Ethereum’s enterprise utility will unlock greater enterprise innovation, spearheaded by organizations like EY building privacy technology on Ethereum. EY (Ernst & Young) now has industrial privacy solutions that support complex business logic, payments and transfers that run on public Ethereum. In the coming year, while enterprises can expect to see demand for audit and risk management go up, they can also expect to see growth in supply chain, procurement, and carbon traceability applications.The world will understand the difference between CeFi and DeFi.The only creditors made whole during the disasters of 2022 were Ethereum-based smart contracts, like those on Aave, where Celsius and Alameda Research repaid their loans to access collateral they posted to borrow dollars. Smart contracts didn’t need to retain Kirkland & Ellis or John Ray III for their reorganization, there was no negotiation and the technology worked transparently without fail as intended. The macro consequence of all this for 2023 will be a greater understanding – by individuals, financial institutions, investors, and regulators – of the difference between CeFi and DeFi. The former is where transactions are subjectively intermediated by humans who are able to improperly tamper with the database. The latter are where transactions are trustlessly and objectively intermediated by math and computer science without manipulation.",2022/12/19

96,"Foundation Devices, a developer of Bitcoin-centric tools that include a hardware wallet, has raised $7 million in a seed round led by crypto-focused investment firm Polychain Capital.The announcement comes during a surge of interest in hardware wallets following the bankruptcy protection filing of centralized crypto exchange FTX, which held and misused customer funds.The funding will help Foundation Devices continue expanding its engineering and design teams and build products, with a near-term focus on software services, according to a draft press release provided to CoinDesk.Other participants in the round included new backers Greenfield Capital and Lightning Ventures and existing investors Third Prime, Warburg Serres, Unpopular Ventures and Bolt.Founded in April 2020, Boston-based Foundation focuses on products that make Bitcoin and decentralized technologies more accessible. The flagship product is Passport, a $259 hardware wallet that uses a camera and QR codes for more secure communication rather than a USB or wireless connection to the outside world.

98,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin was flat heading into Asia hours on Monday, though crypto analysts are warning that pressure from the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary tightening isn't likely to fade anytime soon.Insights: Proof of reserves isn't necessarily the best way to check a company's health.Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.Fed's Powell replaces SBF as crypto-markets bogeymanBy Bradley KeounNow that the most tumultuous phase of the aftermath of the swift collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange has passed, crypto traders are back to dealing with a familiar adversary: the Federal Reserve.The U.S. central bank’s campaign this year to squelch soaring inflation by tightening monetary conditions is again becoming top-of-mind for crypto traders, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell and top officials signaling last week that the stiff pressure might remain well into 2023.“While volatility-crushing fatigue has set in as the Christmas/New year interval approaches, markets will no doubt have to react to this in a bearish way, either with a slow bleed into year-end, or with another January/Q1 sell-off like we saw this year,” the crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Dec. 17 note on Telegram.Crypto markets were sedate over the weekend and staying flat into Asia trading hours early Monday, with the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) unchanged over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, was changing trading hands around 16,760, up 0.18% over 24 hours.According to Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at the bitcoin-focused investment firm NYDIG, investors remain “understandably skittish about the practices of exchanges, prop trading firms and lenders” given the industry events of the past six to nine months.The ongoing pressure from the Fed might “keep a lid on financial assets, including bitcoin, until we get some relief from the monetary policy backdrop,” he wrote in a Dec. 16 newsletter.Glassnode, the data and analysis firm, noted that “supply and demand dynamics show a lack of activity as investors remain wary following the demise of FTX and the FUD around Binance,” the world’s largest crypto exchange. “FUD” is an acronym for “fear, uncertainty and doubt,” and in the crypto lexicon it refers to pretty much any fresh information that tends toward the bearish side.“The outlook for bitcoin is not assured for the year-end given the great resistance above $18K, despite the continued seller exhaustion,” according to Glassnode.Proof of Reserves is useless without proof of liabilitiesBy Sam ReynoldsMazars, the auditing firm working with Binance and other crypto exchanges on proof-of-reserves statements, is pausing its crypto work for the right reason: It's not producing audits, as has been erroneously claimed. But for now, on-chain data is an excellent guide to see who’s really in trouble.Mazars announced Friday that it’s pausing work for crypto clients because what it’s producing is being misunderstood by the public. Almost immediately, the market panicked, pushing down Binance’s BNB token by almost 10%. It’s since recovered 4.6% over the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.Mazars is right for doing this. We shouldn’t be calling these reports audits, because they don’t contain a key element for any financial report – liabilities. But we shouldn’t be panicking either, because on-chain data is so far supporting the reported data from Mazars.There’s a far more interesting metric that we can retrieve via on-chain data that wouldn’t be captured in a Mazars report, which is quality of reserves. And this metric, which measures how reliant an exchange’s reserves are on its proprietary token, shows that Binance doesn’t have the issue some think it does.Data from CryptoQuant, which pioneered the metric in a recent report, shows that Binance’s reserves are 89% clean.In contrast, Huobi’s reserves of roughly $3 billion are 56.7% ""clean"", or to put it another way, 43.3% of its reserves are made up of its own exchange token. It's where our attention should be focused now, and not Binance, given that the exchange is the sixth biggest and does around $422 million in daily volume per CoinGecko data.To be sure, Binance is sometimes its own worst enemy and tends to add fuel to its own fire and encourage conspiracy theories and market panic. Binance is not doing much to help itself by temporarily suspending USDC withdrawals (other stablecoins remained open) and being coy when asked where its controlling company is located.All this comes as Huobi introduces a new burning mechanism to burn more of its token (think: buyback), thus increasing its value. Huobi’s HT token is down nearly 40% on the year, and it's now priced at $5.46, according to CoinGecko data. In a recent press release, Huobi said there was a 15.94% increase in the number of HT burnt in November compared to October, and this will increase more in the first quarter of 2023.“Huobi reserves have a highly risky setup at the moment,” Caue Oliveria, one of CryptoQuant’s author-analysts, wrote in a note to CoinDesk. “Tokens issued by the company itself are a risk to the company's net health, since it is difficult to sustain the veracity of the issuance of these coins.”Oliveria reiterated that FTX’s use of FTT to collateralize loans was one of its causes of failure, and Huobi is playing a dangerous game here.But CoinGecko co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Bobby Ong's take on the situation is more restrained. He told CoinDesk that we also need to know Huobi’s liabilities to get a proper sense of the situation.“If the exchange is not using its collateral to borrow money, it doesn't really matter what the clean reserves are. If every customer’s crypto is fully held 1:1 in proper wallets, it doesn’t really matter,” he told CoinDesk via Telegram. “What is more important is knowing the exchange's liabilities amount. Knowing the reserves is one part of the equation, but more importantly, what are the liabilities.”And those liabilities, for now, are a mystery. Huobi would not respond to emails asking for comment on CryptoQuant’s number or its liabilities by press time. While Huobi has posted its proof of reserves, missing from this report and many other exchange’s similar reports, are its proof of liabilities (hence why Mazars wants out of this business).“If an exchange has $1 billion in bitcoin liability, it better have $1 billion of bitcoin in cold wallet reserves backing this liability,” Ong concluded.In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Dips Under $17K; Binance Proof-of-Reserves Auditor Mazars Pauses All Work for Crypto ClientsFailed crypto exchange FTX is now looking to sell some of its acquisitions, including LedgerX.

99,"Last week John J. Ray III, the new CEO of FTX who is leading the company through bankruptcy proceedings, testified before the House Financial Services Committee about the crypto exchange’s collapse. I honestly don’t think there was much to report from Ray’s testimony beyond: a) the guy knows what he’s doing and b) that he believes FTX’s downfall was really just “old-fashioned embezzlement.”After Ray’s testimony I think most were excited to tune in to former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) scheduled testimony in front of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee. But that testimony was unfortunately canceled on account of the fact that SBF was arrested in the Bahamas after U.S. authorities filed criminal charges last Monday. SBF was denied bail and awaits an extradition hearing in 2023, for which he will wait while sitting in a maggot-infested Bahamian prison.You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) took the opportunity, with crypto top of mind, to react with a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) called the “Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act.” I’m not going to go over the bill point by point here but, if passed, the bill will require anyone who maintains public blockchain infrastructure to register as a Financial Institution (FI). This includes software developers or anyone validating transactions on a network.These FIs would be required to do things like collect the personal information of people who use their software and comply with anti-money laundering (AML) programs to block funds related to crime. On top of that, it would ban any interaction with privacy tools like Tornado Cash (which is sanctioned by the Treasury Department) and privacy-coin protocols including Monero or Zcash.On its face, the bill doesn’t necessarily feel problematic, especially because it was drafted in wake of the FTX collapse. But here's the thing about the bill: It misses The Point. The Point being that a lack of corporate controls and opaque systems led to FTX’s bankruptcy, not someone like me relaying bitcoin transactions with the computer sitting in my living room.The bill misses The Point because it goes after something only related to FTX because the word “crypto” is involved – like how soccer and baseball are related because they are both played with round-ish balls. But a rule in soccer that bans sliding into first base would be kind of … weird (non-sporty readers: There’s no first base in soccer).Proving this, Senator Warren tweeted:If you are paying attention, this has almost nothing to do with FTX. To be clear, I’m not coming to the defense of FTX here. But I am coming to the defense of people like Evan Kaloudis (no relation, although I have donated to his open-source project efforts) who will have to implement a sophisticated AML program for the ZeusLN wallet he developed – a piece of software which is free and open source – if this bill becomes law. Much emphasis on “free” here.On top of that, it is very critical to note that SBF was arrested without this bill becoming law, because he is charged with doing things – like securities fraud and wire fraud and money laundering – which are already illegal.The hoopla around this bill comes from the fact it is primarily focused on financial surveillance, which wouldn’t have stopped FTX from happening. In fact, the bill would make non-custodial use of crypto harder, which would drive users toward the FTXs of the world – not away from them.In all, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act is at worst a poorly veiled attempt at expanding financial surveillance, and at best it’s just a bill that misses The Point due to a lack of institutional crypto knowledge.Elsewhere, Twitter co-founder and Block CEO Jack Dorsey donated a touch more than 14 BTC to Nostr, a decentralized social network. Some Twitter users told him he should look into it and within 24 hours Dorsey funded developer fiatjaf’s Nostr efforts.Nostr isn’t itself a social network. Instead, it is an open protocol with a lean toward censorship resistance. The protocol doesn’t use a centralized server, instead relying on user-run clients. With this client, users can send content around by writing a post, signing it with their private key and relaying it to others’ servers. This relay network can enable others to build social media platforms using it.I think the donation is quite cool. But probably not for the reasons you think.You probably think I think it’s cool because ever since Twitter was taken private there has been an overwhelming sense that users are looking for a better experience and this is a step in the direction of improving that experience.Sure, that’s cool. But what’s cooler is that the funding of this project happened organically. Nostr wasn’t the brainchild of some well-known tech billionaire; it is just a piece of open-source software that was born because, as fiatjaf told me over Telegram, “the old internet where freedom [was] winning is being killed and new, supposedly free platforms won't work in the long run.”Whether you agree with fiatjaf or not on that point, Dorsey discovered Nostr, used it and thought it was interesting enough to warrant funding. So while it didn’t really garner attention until some well-known tech billionaire discovered it, it wasn’t that billionaire’s brainchild and that’s substantially cooler than if it was.Fiatjaf agrees, adding over Telegram that, “money isn’t really the most impactful thing, but the fact that Jack used it and talked about it is more important.”The parallels to Bitcoin are there (please do not take this as a suggestion that Nostr will be as big, important or successful as Bitcoin): Nostr is an open-source, decentralized protocol that people will try to use because they are dissatisfied with current systems. At a minimum, I really am looking forward to how the decentralized social media story continues to develop from here.Let’s tie the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act to Dorsey’s Nostr donation.While not targeted at all open-source developers specifically, if this bill passes then a meaningful cross-section of open-source developers may be tagged as potential criminals. So too will be the people who run and use the open-source software they develop. This tagging won’t stop everyone from using the open-source software, but it would certainly stop most people. This would in turn encourage broader use of large, custodial, centralized platforms like FTX.And while things like Nostr wouldn’t be covered in the passing of this bill, the bill still sponsors at least a partial muzzling of open-source software, the muzzling of which is a muzzling of free speech.In addition, with the funding of Nostr, Dorsey shows that he isn’t missing The Point.The Point is that spectacular failures in centralized systems (like FTX) beget the need to build robust, decentralized systems that protect liberty and freedom and everyday citizens. (As corny as that sounds, it’s true.) The Point is that centralization, in this case at least, is the issue.A natural conclusion here is that this bill would not protect us from another FTX or crypto money-laundering loopholes. It simply isn’t getting at the crux of the issue. I’m in no way suggesting that these senators are proposing this bill in bad faith; I’m only suggesting that the advertised purpose of a bill should be achievable given the laws that would be enforced in the event that the bill passes.So in the same way that I look forward to the development of decentralized social networks, I also look forward to the development of laws that make sense in the context of what they are governing.",2022/12/18

101,"We at Blockdaemon predict that the future of Web3 will be built on a foundation of seamless user experience: seamless use, seamless monetization and seamless governance. The success of any Web3 project is dependent on its ability to deliver this seamless experience to all users, including developers and enterprises within the blockchain space.We believe that blockchain-based solutions are the future of digital infrastructure. In order for them to take off, however, we need to ensure that the user experience is of high quality. This means that both users and developers need an easy way to access Web3 infrastructure and apps built on top of it.Friedrich ""Freddy"" Zwanzger is the Ethereum ecosystem lead at Blockdaemon, a leading independent blockchain infrastructure platform. This story is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 outlook.The work developers perform in 2023 will lay the foundation for the next wave of crypto adoption. This foundation will be based on the building blocks of cheap, modular, scalable and reliable blockchain infrastructure. The Ethereum protocol will serve as a manifest example to prove our point.We predict that this critical infrastructure, developed next year and beyond, will onboard billions of new users and hundreds of institutions in the future.However, this can only be achieved through great crypto products and use cases.The strong market conditions we’ve seen play out between late 2020 and 2021 revealed this need for solid infrastructure to support such applications.Unlike previous market cycles, 2021 saw large-scale institutional and developer adoption take place. Both financial institutions and decentralized application (dapp) creators needed a simple way to build on top of secure blockchain infrastructure.Many of the companies who built during the bull market will now struggle during the market downturn. This is mainly due to not having positive cash flow combined with insufficient treasury management skills.Well-thought-out, properly funded projects will survive and thrive during this crypto winter, while those that aren’t will struggle or fail.The Ethereum protocol is by far the most revenue-generating blockchain network. The Merge from the energy-intensive proof-of-work to the significantly more efficient proof-of-stake laid important groundwork for the future and in turn achieved 0% inflation since September, when the Merge took place..Over the past 20 years infrastructure services have dramatically reshaped the way online businesses are built.The dawn of cloud-based infrastructure radically reduced overheads for web companies. Consumers enjoyed faster, more responsive applications while developers could focus their time building innovative products.While the need for reliable blockchain infrastructure has technically existed since the introduction of Bitcoin, it is only relatively recently that builders have had access to the tools needed to support the growth of this decentralized future.Cloud infrastructure brought powerful benefits to the web. Blockchain follows the same deflationary route of other technologies, radically reducing costs associated with legacy systems. However, developing the killer apps of blockchain relies on the same high-quality infrastructure that Web2 enjoys.Such infrastructure support is needed to meet the growing demand for dapps, spanning complex needs across a wide range of use cases.However, projects in 2023 will need to focus and double down to set themselves up for later success, to meet these complex needs and use cases.This coming year will be a tipping point for crypto projects that are looking to position themselves well for the next wave of crypto growth.We predict that to excel under current market conditions, Web3 companies will need to focus on three core essentials:Companies must tighten their product offerings in order to win. This concentrates scarce resources, both time and money, on key value-adding areas.  It means knowing the market deeply and finding product market fit.Many large-scale institutional investors seek to invest in companies that are product oriented. Web3 companies should focus on building products that create better, seamless experiences for their customers using blockchain.Enabling withdrawals of staked ether (ETH) can be seen as such a feature and will be delivered to retail and institutional stakers alike around March 2023. It eliminates the previous capital lock-up on the Ethereum PoS network, thus eliminating the biggest point of friction.True long-term value is created when a company is a vertical domain expert across one (or many) of the rising categories of the future.A practical focus on product should fuse with a vision of what clients in the future will look for. By building value in these fertile fields, companies gain a powerful vantage point for the future. Being vertically integrated in key growth areas creates competitive moats.A company’s ability to create deep tech solutions in any one (or several) of these fields truly adds value to customers in the long term.History has shown us that companies with the right product offering can grow exponentially when the markets turn up.However, for blockchain businesses that experience exponential growth in a short space of time, it is very impractical to scale the physical node operations themselves. Service outages across popular blockchain platforms is a common occurrence during a bull market, which is equivalent to a power cut at a big retail store on Black Friday.What this means is that blockchain businesses must also prepare their infrastructure for that potential wave of customers that could occur at any moment, while managing the associated costs and overhead.Again, Ethereum serves as an example by scheduling EIP-4844 proto-danksharding in the fall of 2023 as a scaling solution for its thriving layer 2 ecosystem. Without taking sides on which of the layer 2 variations will be successful, the infrastructure enhancement will increase capacity by 10 to 100 times as an important step towards the 100,000 TPS goal.This coming year will be a time for building. When markets return, companies that take advantage of this time will be ideally positioned.The Holy Grail for the next wave of crypto adoption will be when customers use blockchain seamlessly, without needing to know or understand the underlying tech. Just as we use video calls without knowing the underlying protocol, VOIP, so too will blockchain become a frictionless, user-friendly and branded transfer of value and data. We’ll see social media giants incorporating crypto payments without users ever needing to know it’s blockchain behind the scenes.Ultimately, reliable access to robust and scalable blockchain infrastructure will make all of this possible.",2022/12/16

Statistically, prices stay within two standard deviations of its average approximately 95% of the time, so a move beyond either band is important to monitor.In trending markets, a move beyond an upper or lower band can signal a sharp price move in that direction. In markets similar in nature to the flattish one we’re currently experiencing, it can signal that prices have moved too far in one direction, and are poised to revert to the average.The sharp move down may provide a compelling entry point.",2022/12/16
103,"One of the founders behind OneCoin pleaded guilty to federal U.S. charges on Friday after one of the largest financial scams of all time, according to the Department of Justice.The purported cryptocurrency project was fraudulent from its 2014 beginnings, prosecutors said, with OneCoin – co-founded by Karl Greenwood – setting up a pyramid scheme to market it to millions of people, generating as much as $4 billion in revenue. Greenwood, 45, who allegedly called the investors “idiots” in an internal message, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money.“Karl Sebastian Greenwood operated one of the largest international fraud schemes ever perpetrated,” said Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. “Greenwood and his co-conspirators, including fugitive Ruja Ignatova, conned unsuspecting victims out of billions of dollars, claiming that OneCoin would be the ‘Bitcoin killer.’”Ignatova, known as the “CryptoQueen,” remains on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Most Wanted list as another founder of OneCoin, which was based in Bulgaria. The FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to her arrest.Williams said this case and other recent actions are meant to send “a clear message that we are coming after all those who seek to exploit the cryptocurrency ecosystem through fraud, no matter how big or sophisticated you are.”Greenwood, a citizen of Sweden and the U.K., had been arrested at his home in Thailand in 2018 and extradited to the U.S.Read More: OneCoin Co-Conspirator Frank Schneider Faces Money-Laundering Charges",2022/12/16
104,"There are hazardous gaps in how crypto is overseen, according to the latest annual report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) – restating a view that’s long been adopted by U.S. lawmakers, regulators and the industry itself.The FSOC – a panel of U.S. financial agency chiefs that includes U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the heads of several other regulatory agencies – met Friday to discuss risks to the financial system and approve the council’s annual report. While echoing the same widely held concerns about an inability to reach into spot markets for tokens that aren’t securities, the report shared another common position: Only Congress can give the agencies the powers they need to establish a full set of rules that covers the whole crypto industry.The report specifically recommended ""legislation relating to regulators’ authorities to have visibility into and supervise the activities of all of the affiliates and subsidiaries of crypto-asset entities.""Yellen said risks from digital asset represent one of the ""key priorities"" in this year's report.""We have seen significant shocks and volatility in the crypto assets system over the past year, including in recent months,"" she said.The FSOC was built as the ultimate lookout for future financial tsunamis after the global mess in 2008. Officials were quick to point out that crypto’s current troubles don’t pose any current risk to the traditional system during the meeting. The Treasury document illustrated that point with the fresh example of industry turmoil caused by the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, which left U.S. banking unscathed.""The problems at FTX precipitated price decreases in bitcoin and other crypto-assets, but thus far have had a limited impact on the broader U.S. financial system,"" the document noted.In a separate closed-door portion of the meeting, the regulators – including Gary Gensler, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Rostin Behnam, who runs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – discussed the recent crypto market dramas. According to a summary of that conversation later released by the Treasury Department, the members are watching those developments closely and ""spillovers to the traditional financial system have remained limited"" so far.""While the risks from the crypto markets generally do not appear to date to have spread to the traditional financial sector, we must remain vigilant to guard against that possibility,"" Gensler said in the open meeting. Already, he argued, the ""largely non-compliant market"" is putting individual investors at risk.The annual report also flagged a topic that could be considered a legacy of FTX: Its campaign to cut out the middlemen in clearing crypto derivatives trades, including the proposal that customers’ positions could be closed out by an automated system. The council called for a closer look at the dangers that concept might pose, even though FTX’s proposal to the CFTC was dropped by the company when it collapsed.The sentiments expressed in the latest annual report are similar to the much lengthier document released by the council in October at the behest of President Joe Biden’s executive order. That earlier report suggested Congress needs to soon pick an agency that will have power over the spot markets for bitcoin trading and any other cryptocurrencies that aren’t deemed securities. So far, most legislation favors the CFTC in that role.Read More: What’s Inside the FSOC’s Long-awaited Report on Crypto RegulationUPDATE (Dec. 16, 2022, 17:01 UTC): Adds details from the report.UPDATE (Dec. 16, 2022, 17:13 UTC): Adds congressional and FTX references from the report.UPDATE (Dec. 16, 2022, 17:27 UTC): Adds comment from SEC's Gensler.UPDATE (Dec. 16, 2022, 17:46 UTC): Adds comment from Treasury Department's readout on the closed-door session.",2022/12/16
105,"The pace of technological innovation in crypto finance is nothing short of astounding. Bitcoin, the “magic internet money” of yesterday, is now knocking on the doors of high street shops, bars and restaurants.The Lightning Network (LN), a web of interconnected nodes managed by crypto enthusiasts, is driving this revolution. LN transaction throughput and speed are already rivalling those of Visa and Mastercard for a fraction of the cost.Vlad Goryachev is a former Wall Street derivatives trader and structurer turned Bitcoin enthusiast. This article is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023.More and more retail establishments are thinking to start accepting “crypto,” but don’t know where to start. This guide will present and compare side by side all the available options for the business owners to make an informed choice.I’ll start by describing the solutions in alphabetical order and conclude with a summary matrix that could help retailers decide which to integrate. To qualify, each implementation must satisfy two criteria:1) Enable businesses to accept BTC payments via Lightning Network2) Do that face-to-face, (i.e., mom and pops and Box Top stores should be able to generate a Lightning invoice/QR code a client can scan to pay)Some of the solutions will present an option to automatically convert the proceeds into local currency, others will not. It will be up to the business owner to decide whether to hold bitcoin or do the conversions manually.See also: Move Over, Ethereum – Bitcoin's Lightning Network Has Apps TooI leave out of the scope other blockchains and stablecoins. In this day and age they are objectively inferior to LN as a payment rail.A U.S. company that offers a centralized wallet and bookkeeping suite with ability to accept a range of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin over the Lightning Network. To use it, a Lightning QR code is generated by the “BitPay Checkout” app linked with a users online BitPay account via an API code. Proceeds can be converted into local currency and withdrawn via ACH, SEPA, FPS, etc. Full KYC [know-your-customer] enrollment is required to start using the service. The company charges a flat 1% fee on the proceeds. Funds are at risk until withdrawn, because the wallet is centralized.Other notes: Only the iPhone version of this app existed at the time of testing. Trustpilot rated it at a 1.3.A free open-source app for iOS and Android that also accepts a range of cryptocurrencies, including Lightning bitcoin. Users can also send out remote requests for payment.To use Lightning, BitRequest requires a user to already own a Lightning node. The solution does not have access to private keys, therefore it is non-custodial (requires no trust in any third-party). Owning a Lightning node involves setting up and managing Lightning Network connections, or channels, to other Lightning nodes – a task that requires both time and substantial investment. To convert proceeds into local currency, the user would have to open an account on a crypto exchange (KYC route) or use non-KYC, peer-to-peer services like bisq.network or Robosats.A free and open-source app for Android that creates a non-custodial wallet and opens Lightning channels to a user's Breez node automatically (or to another chosen node). The first accepted payment, and each subsequent payment above 20 euro, bear a fee of 0.4% or a minimum of 2,000 sats, to cover channel opening costs. The channels get reused when money is paid out. The app does not offer conversion to fiat currencies, but can use any of them as a base to calculate the amount of sats for the Lightning invoice.Breez is currently in beta testing and users must accept a warning that their funds could be lost. For this reason I could not include it in the summary matrix. However, I do find this solution very innovative.BTCPay is a storied, non-custodial option that’s popular among crypto enthusiasts. The software code is free and open source and can be deployed through a variety of methods including a cloud or a local server. For example, one can install it with one click onto an Umbrel Lightning node running on a Raspberry Pi microcomputer. Such a server would be able to host a number of businesses (nearby shops and restaurants) all connecting to it via local Wi-Fi or cloud DNS. All of them, however, would need to trust the owner of the server. For users who do not want to set up and manage their own Lightning node there are cloud services like Voltage that allow renting for $10 per month. However, in this case the solution becomes custodial.This option is made by a Slovakian company, and offers a similar service to BitPay for 0.8% fee. The app, which only requires an email to use, allows automatic daily settlement in crypto or fiat to a personal wallet or bank account. Though, KYC is required for fiat withdrawals. When I tested the app, I found that the BTC/EUR conversion rate was an average of 0.5% higher than prices listed on CoinMarketCap. Further, the app did not show the exchange rate or data source. There is a maximum of 0.03 BTC (600 euros) set for invoices. Crypto withdrawals, including Lightning, incur a 0.5% fee and fiat withdrawals potentially incur “additional bank fees,” according to the Confirmo website. Funds are at risk until withdrawn. Trustpilot rating: 3.0.This subsidiary of the Slovenia-based company Eligma offers a physical POS device for 450 euros plus shipping cost as well as a free web version. Transaction fees vary by country, from 1.25% to 5%. Proceeds can be received in over 50 cryptocurrencies with optional conversion to fiat. Payouts are executed four times a month. Online onboarding is not available to test the service. Funds are at risk until withdrawn. Trustpilot rating is not available.A lightweight web app offering a “hybrid” solution. It is open source and free to use. The software is simply a gateway to a crypto exchange Bitfinex, but is separate from the crypto exchange’s “BFX Pay” platform. It can be run from LNPOS.me website or installed on the user's own server.See also: Bitcoin's Lightning Network Could Be Getting a Privacy UpgradeLNPOS works by requesting a Lightning deposit address from the exchange, and displaying it on a user’s phone or tablet as a QR code. Proceeds are automatically converted to a range of local currencies and stablecoins. Easy registration with email is available for testing. KYC verification is necessary to withdraw fiat. Bitfinex does not accept U.S .customers. Trustpilot rating: 3.2.This is a “Lightning LEGO set"" or, as the developers call it, a “Free Open-Source Lightning Accounts System with Extensions.” Much like BTCPay Server, it can be installed on an Umbrel node and activated using a TPoS terminal extension. However, to start accepting bitcoin payments, users need to also build or purchase a physical DIY POS terminal. This solution involves manual fiat conversions and, to remain non-custodial, a Lightning node you control.OpenNode is a registered corporation in Delaware that accepts Lightning payments and offers optional conversion to fiat. Upfront KYC is required. Weekly bitcoin withdrawals come with a 1% processing fee while on-demand withdrawals cost 1% extra for on-chain bitcoin (but are free for Lightning). Bank transfers charge a 0.2% fee in local currencies. Funds are at risk until withdrawn. Trustpilot rating: 3.0.The best non-custodial solution for a technically apt bitcoin investor is BTCPay Server. For a more cautious user, who would like to convert all incoming proceeds into fiat and has no desire to manage a Lightning node, the LNPOS.me web-app is a free alternative outside the U.S. For U.S. customers, OpenNode has better reviews.",2022/12/16

On Thursday, the exchange petitioned a U.S. bankruptcy court for permission to sell several subsidiaries, including FTX Japan, FTX Europe and Embed Business. ""Based on their preliminary review, the debtors own or control a number of subsidiaries and assets that are regulated, licensed and/or largely not integrated into the debtors’ operations, within and outside of the United States,"" the filing said. ""The debtors believe a number of these entities have solvent balance sheets, independent management and valuable franchises.""Crypto trading firm Amber Group changed its fundraising strategy to raise $300 million in a Series C round, as a reaction to the fall of FTX. The collapse of the exchange affected some of Amber’s products and customers, increasing the need to raise capital quickly. Amber decided to move from its efforts to raise a Series B+ round at a $3 billion valuation in favor of a Series C. ""Post the FTX collapse, we paused [the series B+ fundraise] after a partial closing and instead moved forward on Series C,"" the firm said.Bitcoin (BTC) was down 4% to just below $17,000 early Friday Eastern time, and ether (ETH) dropped 6% to $1,212 as more bad news in the crypto world keeps coming forth.

107,"The crypto market traded weak on Friday after French audit firm Mazars, which recently did Binance's proof-of-reserves report, suspended work for crypto exchange clients and global markets traded risk averse.Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell 2% to $16,950, extending a retreat from the one-month high of $18,300 reached Wednesday. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, fell 4.3% to $1,210, hitting the lowest since Nov. 29, CoinDesk data shows.Binance's BNB fell over 3% to $247, a level last seen on Sept. 26, and other major coins including XRP, LTC, and SOL registered similar losses.Mazars discontinued its veritas.mazars.com website dedicated to crypto audits in a move that probably highlights the prevailing discomfort among traditional institutions to associate with crypto projects.""Overnight crypto dump courtesy of Mazars and Binance worries,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted.Early this month, Mazars published Binance's proof-of-reserves report, showing the giant exchange's bitcoin reserves were overcollateralized. The report, however, did not provide details about the internal controls in Binance's margin and loan products, raising doubts about the exchange's health.Binance saw customer withdrawals worth several hundred million dollars as investors scrambled to take direct custody of their coins.Several observers have dismissed the uncertainty surrounding Binance as coordinated FUD, a crypto slang for fear, uncertainty and doubt.""Paid lobbyists and spokespersons are carrying SBF's voice and torch while he tries to change the narrative of the misappropriation of customer funds. As those attempts have been largely discredited, the attacks on Binance have intensified,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, wrote in a note to clients on Friday, referring to Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the FTX exchange.Investors in traditional markets sold risk, driving the U.S. stock futures lower and adding to the crypto market's woes as early this week, major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, pushed back against expectations for an early pivot to liquidity easing.At press time, the futures tied to the S&P 500 traded 1% lower, signaling a possible extension of Thursday's 2.5% slide.The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday said that while rate hikes could slow, more liquidity tightening is needed to control inflation, forcing markets to reassess expectations for rate cuts in the second half of 2023.The European Central Bank said it will raise interest rates ""significantly"" in the months ahead to combat entrenched inflation.""The ECB has been unusually clear in its pushback against market pricing.

108,"Things could soon go from bad to worse for bitcoin (BTC) traders looking for bullish cues on technical charts.The cryptocurrency's 50-week simple moving average (SMA) is falling fast and looks set to cross below the 200-week SMA for the first time on record.According to technical analysis theory, the bearish intersection of the two averages, often referred to as the ""death cross,"" means the market is about to head into a tailspin.Bitcoin has dropped 75% since reaching a record high of $69,000 in November of last year. The bear market has proved to be more intense than the previous ones during which sellers failed to establish a foothold under the 200-day SMA.Critics of technical analysis would point out that the death cross, irrespective of whether it occurs on the daily or weekly charts, is a lagging indicator and unreliable. That's largely true, as the indicator is based on backward-looking moving averages and reflects the asset's past performance.The death cross has a bad reputation for trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market in traditional finance. And it has done so to bitcoin traders in the past. For instance, the daily chart death cross of March 2020 marked a major price bottom.Seasoned traders, therefore, read the death cross in conjunction with other chart factors and fundamental indicators, which are split on the next possible move in bitcoin.Per Delphi Digital, bitcoin's sideways trading in the range of $16,500 to $17,300 in the aftermath of FTX's collapse offers little hope to the bulls.""We still believe this area does not have much structural support, and in the face of further contagion and uncertainty, we remain cautious as we watch the $9k-13k level,"" Delphi's strategists, led by Andrew Krohn, wrote in a note to clients.Several miners or those responsible for minting coins are likely to go bankrupt in the first half of next year, pushing bitcoin to $12,000 and below. Add to that the U.S. Federal Reserve's persistent anti-stimulus bias and the path of least resistance appears to be on the downside.That said, in the past, bitcoin has bottomed out to begin a new rally 15 months ahead of the mining reward halving, a programmed 50% reduction in the pace of supply expansion every four years.The next bitcoin halving is due in March/April 2024.

110,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin and the CoinDesk Market Index turned lower as traders started to rethink the takeaway from this week's Federal Reserve meeting.Insights: Ethereum had 192 active developers on Dec. 14, the highest number of developers among blockchain projects, data from Token Terminal suggests.Crypto sentiment makes quick reversalBy Bradley KeounIf Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting brought a buoyant mood to crypto markets, Thursday's action brought a reality check.Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value was down 2.6% over the past 24 hours, to about $17,400, tracking a similar trajectory in U.S. stocks.Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest overall, lost 3.6%, to $1,262. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) slid 2.4%. Optimism's OP token ranked among the biggest losers with a 10% decline.The take of CoinDesk markets analyst Glenn Williams Jr. was that the Federal Reserve, while slowing the pace of interest-rate increases, still has a long way to go before it can end its campaign to wring out inflation. Before price rises can moderate, the Fed will have to see a pretty significant increase in unemployment – to keep expectations of higher wages from becoming entrenched. Hopes of a quick reversal by the Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues might be premature. Funding rates – a key barometer of sentiment in crypto derivatives markets – are still pointing negative.By Sage D. YoungThe number of daily active developers working on top blockchains and decentralized applications (dapps) has decreased roughly 57% this year, according to financial data platform Token Terminal.In January, about 3,700 daily developers were active, compared to almost 1,600 on Dec. 14, data from Token Terminal suggests, which tracks daily totals.The decline has come as ether, the token of the Ethereum blockchain, and other cryptocurrencies have plummeted from record highs little more than a year ago. ETH was recently trading at about $1,300, down 64% from the start of the year when the second largest crypto by market capitalization was still hovering near $4,000. The number of projects built on the Ethereum platform over this period has plummeted as some projects have failed and increasingly risk averse investors have deployed their money at a slower rate than during 2021’s bull market.“It’s not surprising to see an overall decline in daily active devs,” said Chris Eberle, angel investor and contributor at Coordinape and PleasrDAO who goes by DeFi Ginger on Twitter. “2022 has been punch after punch for crypto. The impact to the market and the overall brand of crypto is just brutal.”Eberle noted that this year’s crypto debacles, including the recent collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX and failing of centralized lender Celsius Network, have created “one, big ball of pain” for the industry that has also contributed to the decline in active developers.With 192 developers as of Dec. 14, Ethereum currently has the most daily developers among blockchain protocols and dapps. Cardano and Cosmos rank second and third with 144 and 143 active developers, respectively. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently has 18 active developers.According to Token Terminal, Solana saw the largest reduction from roughly 2,500 devs in January to 75 developers at the time of publication, although the protocol insisted in a tweet last month that thousands of developers are working on the platform. “Something doesn’t add up, Eberle said. ""Solana fell off a cliff before [the FTX collapse].”He added: ”Others seem to have some dip but it could well be seasonal as we’re in the holiday zone now.”Token Terminal’s methodology to determine an “active developer” is based on the “number of distinct GitHub users that made 1+ commits to the project’s GitHub repositories during the past 30 days.”Overall, the number of the active developers in the crypto space has stabilized between 1,500 and 1,600 since mid summer, suggesting that a core of the determined, adequately funded people remain convinced of blockchain technology’s potential.4:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(8:30 UTC) Germany S&P Global/BME Composite PMI (Dec)5:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(9:00 UTC) Eurozone S&P Global Composite PMI (Dec)5:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(9:30 UTC) Great Britain S&P Global/CIPS Services PMI (Dec)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Top FTX Group Exec Tipped Off Authorities Prior to Bankruptcy Filing; Charges Pile Up Against Sam Bankman-FriedAs he sits in jail in the Bahamas, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried finds himself facing a litany of both criminal and civil charges.

112,"One interpretation of U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments this week is that, while he acknowledged the recent progress in bringing down inflation, material increases in unemployment might still be necessary medicine to stabilize consumer prices that were rising earlier this year at their fastest pace in four decades.The reality may have started to set in on Thursday as prices for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) moderated following Wednesday’s gains. Despite the increase in rates coming in slower, as expected, markets were seemingly caught off guard by Powell's hawkish commentary about the need to keep pressing forward, well into 2023.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed’s monetary-policy panel, released a fresh Summary of Economic Projections after this week’s meeting, including estimates for a 2023 unemployment rate that ranges from 4%-5.3%, up from the current 3.7%. The civilian labor force participation rate fell to 62.10% in November from 62.2% in the previous month. The civilian labor force participation rate is the number of employed and unemployed but looking for a job as a percentage of the population aged 16 years and over.So how is the latest Fed information dump playing in crypto markets? Sentiment for digital assets can be gauged in part by viewing BTC and ETH’s respective funding rates.Funding rates represent payments that occur on exchanges that facilitate the trading of perpetual futures contracts. When rates are positive, holders of long positions pay short positions. When negative, the opposite occurs. The extent to which funding rates are positive or negative can give a window into investor sentiment.Bitcoin’s funding rate recently dipped into negative territory, reflecting a shift to bearish sentiment. A look over the last month shows that funding rates have oscillated back and forth, unsurprising given uncertainty around BTC prices.Ether has taken a divergent path, showing positive funding rates for ETH during 14 of the most recent 16 trading days.The lack of agreement between the two assets is eyebrow raising because BTC and ETH prices are generally highly correlated. The discrepancy has not yet been realized in spot markets as the ETH/BTC pair has traded flat over the past month.So the sour taste of the medicine might be seeping into markets before it’s even administered.UPDATE (Dec. 15 20:55 UTC): Adds definition of the civilian labor force participation rate.",2022/12/15
113,"In the aftermath of the collapse of FTX, many are justifiably concerned about the solvency of crypto exchanges. Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent bucket shop may have been an outlier – court documents filed earlier this week by U.S. authorities allege that some $8 billion in FTX customer deposits were transferred to and lost by SBF’s “hedge fund” Alameda Research.But following a decline in crypto prices, a drawdown of debt between highly interconnected firms and several bankruptcy filings that have locked up billions worth of assets in legal proceedings, it’s reasonable to wonder if there is as much money held on centralized, largely unaudited crypto exchanges as there should be.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.This is part of the reason why users are taking possession of their own coins in recent weeks. Binance, the industry leading centralized crypto exchange, in particular has seen a significant drawdown in funds. Some of its largest clients, such as Jump Trading, have taken coins out, and the exchange moved to temporarily halt USDC withdrawals amid the surge (potentially to execute a token swap to its own stablecoin).See also: And Then There Was One – Changpeng Zhao – CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022Earlier this week, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao referred to this trend as “business as usual.” He also reportedly told employees to brace for a few “bumpy” months ahead. The exchange had published a so-called “proof-of-reserves” report conducted by auditing firm Mazars showing, depending on which figures you include, it was either over- or under-collateralized in its bitcoin holdings.Not to draw an unnecessary comparison to FTX, but CZ’s public comments this week are reminiscent of Bankman-Fried’s attempts to quell fears in early November amid a “run” on the exchange before it filed for bankruptcy protection. On Nov. 7, SBF tweeted that client funds were safe and backed by deposits – a message he deleted after it became clear FTX was deeply in the red. It’s a comparison CZ himself is drawing.“With Sam Bankman-Fried’s arrest, I think people generalize. So if you get hurt by one bank, you're gonna think all the other banks are bad. If one politician is corrupt, you think all politicians are corrupt,” he wrote. “But the fact is that because one bank is bad doesn't mean all the other banks are bad. And just because one politician is bad doesn't mean all the other politicians are bad.”This is all well and good – except that crypto exchanges are not, in fact, banks. As my colleague David Z. Morris notes, the term “run on the bank” has been misapplied when talking about recent withdrawals on crypto exchanges. The phenomenon is similar: withdrawals beget withdrawals, fears over insolvency can compound and become self-fulfilling. But unlike banks, users simply have to take it as a matter of faith that exchange operators haven’t misused or lost customer funds.Centralized crypto exchanges reintroduce an element of trust that trustless protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum remove from finance. Users take on the risks, even if rare, of hacks, frozen withdrawals and other business failures, Casa’s Nick Neuman said recently. And so, amid a period of uncertainty, Zhao’s primary responsibility is to reestablish confidence in his exchange.Binance has certainly made moves to keep funds on its platform. On Wednesday, crypto critic Bitfinex’ed tweeted a screenshot of a Binance offering to pay 50% APR on staked USDT, seemingly to keep assets on the exchange. Later in the day, Zhao took to Twitter Spaces to criticize self-custodying crypto, alleging that “99% of people … will end up losing” their funds if they have to be responsible for their own keys.This is no doubt a challenging time for Zhao. On Monday, Reuters reported the U.S. Department of Justice was nearing the end of a multi-year investigation into Binance – one of several ongoing probes into the firm from global law enforcement agencies. Federal prosecutors may ultimately charge CZ and other Binance executives with money-laundering violations, a risk that has accelerated withdrawals.His comments spreading fears about self-custody are entirely unjustified. Not only is it seemingly in allegiance with U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s recent Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act that would put unnecessary guardrails around so-called un-hosted wallets but also contradictory to Zhao’s comments just last month calling self-custody a “fundamental human right.”See also: Self-Custodial Onboarding Will Be the Norm in Web3's 2023 | Crypto 2023Rebuilding trust in Binance, stymying outflows, should not come at the expense of crypto’s principle innovation – enabling people to “be their own bank.”FTX’s collapse was a startling turn of fate for what was once one of the most-trusted crypto companies. Bankman-Fried has gone from being the industry’s J.P. Morgan to its Bernie Madoff. It’s an event that has caused irreparable damage to crypto’s public standing. Binance, too, has an outsized role in the industry – and hopefully it is not another FTX.But if Zhao has to make low blows to a fundamental attribute of crypto to rescue is own exchange’s reputation, then it deserves to fail. To take an old line from Zhao, “some things are better left unsaid. Recommend no more news like these, for the sake of the people, our industry (and your business).""",2022/12/15
114,"Asset manager CSOP says its bitcoin and ether ETFs have raised nearly $79 million as they debut today on the Hong Kong stock exchange.The fund manager launched new bitcoin and ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETF) that began trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Dec. 16, according to a press release. They will be the first listed bitcoin and ether futures ETFs available in Asia, according to CSOP.The launch is notable since the Chinese government officially banned crypto trading and mining in September 2021, though Hong Kong currently maintains an autonomous financial and legal system. The two new funds will be actively managed to invest in Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group)-listed bitcoin and ether futures to track their respective prices.“The approval of two new ETFs based on CME Bitcoin and Ether futures marks an important milestone for the digital asset ecosystem in Asia,” said Tim McCourt, CME Group’s Global Head of Equity and FX Products, in a statement.CSOP had previously launched Hong Kong’s first Metaverse ETF, which was listed on the HK Stock Exchange in February.The first bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds in the U.S. were approved last year, and while a number of spot bitcoin funds have been submitted for approval to the SEC, none have been approved thus far.ProShares' Bitcoin Strategy ETF, a bitcoin futures ETF launched in the U.S. last year, attracted more than $1 billion during its first two days of trading at the height of the bull market. In the year since it launched, the ETF has attracted inflows of $1.8 billion, and outflows of $619 million despite the underlying value of bitcoin declining by nearly 70% in the same time period.UPDATE (Dec 16, 3:03 UTC): Updates throughout",2022/12/15
115,"There is an uncanny sense of calm in the bitcoin (BTC) market despite lingering FTX contagion fears and macroeconomic uncertainty. Analysts are scrambling to explain the perplexing tranquility.Bitcoin's annualized seven-day implied volatility (IV), or the options market's forecast of a likely movement in the underlying asset, has declined to a two-year low of 38.2%, according to data source Amberdata.The metric – often equated with the degree of uncertainty or fear – peaked at 145% on Nov. 9 and has been falling since, even as the FTX contagion spreads and experts fear a wave of miner bankruptcies.To Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, the declining volatility is not surprising.""Volatility expectations will continue to drop. Lower volatility is one of my favorite trades for 2023,"" Thielen told CoinDesk. ""The macro outlook is extremely constructive, with inflation falling like a rock and the recent decline in oil making the Ukraine war less relevant.""Thielen added that the FTX headlines will now have less impact on the market, with investigations doing the dirty work in the background and cited China's recent decision to relax inflationary COVID-19 restrictions as a source of downward pressure on implied volatility.Negative headlines have had less impact on bitcoin's price of late. The cryptocurrency has risen 9% to $17,700 since crypto lender BlockFi filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 28. Dominant crypto exchange Binance’s health came under extra scrutiny early this week, with clients withdrawing large sums of their coins. Bitcoin has managed to eke out 3% gains for the week.Perhaps traders have moved on from the FTX collapse, having bought options to hedge their exposure following the FTX debacle, pushing implied volatility higher at that point.""Market participants have already hedged contagion implications, which are still relevant, but the hedging occurred when the market was in a more fearful state, leading the hedging costs to grow,"" Vetle Lunde, research analyst at Arcane, said.""The current low IV regime reflects that traders are satisfied with the current exposure (hedges already in play) and expectations of less volatility in the foreseeable future,"" Lunde noted.Options activity picked up pace in mid-November as traders bought ether, solana and bitcoin put options to hedge downside risks, while users with funds locked on FTX switched to trading futures on other exchanges.Or maybe crypto traders have just had their fill of 2022 already.Volumes in both spot and derivatives markets have crashed since then, indicating market stagnancy. That's typical of the pre-holiday season lull.Institutional interest has dwindled, as evidenced by the decline in active bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The so-called futures open interest has dropped to 69,000 contracts, the lowest since October.The share of non-exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the open interest has hit an all-time low of nearly 41%.""In the light of muted activity and expected slow times ahead, it's likely that volatility will continue to compress, which in turn is reflected in options,"" Lunde said.",2022/12/15

117,"Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume traded, is not the next FTX, according a report from CryptoQuant.The Seoul-based analytics firm points to on-chain data to support claims made in a recent audit that Binance is overcollateralized.“At the time Binance’s Proof of Reserves report was conducted, CryptoQuant’s estimate of Binance’s BTC reserves (liabilities) was 591,939 BTC. This compares to the PoR report’s Customer Liability Report Balance of 597,602 BTC. We can see that CryptoQuant data covered 99% of Binance's liabilities,” CryptoQuant wrote, using the ticker symbol for bitcoin. Collateralization is 101% when taking the exchange's assets and debtors into account, it said.Binance is not experiencing the same volume of outflows that FTX had in the days before its collapse, CryptoQuant wrote, citing on-chain data. While withdrawals have increased, they are small compared with the exchange’s overall reserves. In a tweet, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said he “welcomes the stress test.”Binance’s bitcoin reserves are up 4% since FTX's collapse, CryptoQuant wrote. Reserves for ether and stablecoins are down 6% and 15%, respectively.CryptoQuant points out that Binance differs from FTX-Alameda in how ""clean"" the reserves are, or, to put it another way, how they're not reliant on the exchange’s proprietary token, BNB. A CoinDesk report that showed FTX sister company Alameda Research was materially backed by the exchange's FTT token kicked off a liquidity crisis that ultimately led to its bankruptcy.For Binance, CryptoQuant says 88.95% of its reserves are clean. That compares with 56% for Huobi, 66.5% for Bitfinex, 81.64% for Kucoin, 97% for Crypto.com and 100% for OKX.Data from Nansen pegs Binance’s total reserves at $57.4 billion versus $3.04 billion for Huobi, $2.47 billion for Kucoin, $3.36 billion for Crypto.com, and $6.67 billion for OKX. Nansen doesn’t have data for Bitfinex.CryptoQuant says that Binance’s level of clean reserve is “acceptable.”While there have been some questions about the financial health of Binance, Hochan Chung, CryptoQuant’s head of marketing, points to the availability of on-chain data to corroborate all claims, even if you don’t trust the exchange’s published report.“Proof of reserve provides a real-time, transparent, and non-manufactured data, which is the first-time ever in the history of the financial market. The data is self-audited through blockchain technology,” he said in a Telegram message.What on-chain data can’t account for is corporate control. FTX was known for lavish spending on employee perks, such as luxury apartments for staff, a generous DoorDash allowance for food delivery, and a chartered aircraft to fly Amazon deliveries to the Bahamas from the U.S.""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,"" FTX’s new CEO, John J. Ray III, who was also involved in cleaning up Enron’s mess, said in a court document. ""From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.""Hal Schroeder, a former Financial Accounting Standards Board member and Rutgers University professor, told the Wall Street Journal that the audit Binance presented doesn’t comment on the quality of Binance’s internal controls.“In light of what we’ve seen in the Bahamas, I don’t want to conclude that all the systems are that good,” he said.Binance Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann recently tweeted corporate travel at company is more austere than at FTX.“Binance literally booked me at a Citadines ($83 a night) the last time I traveled to our Paris office.

120,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin rose early but later fell after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell damped enthusiasm stemming from a less-aggressive rate hike with hawkish comments.Insights: Is Dr. Copper's recent upturn a positive sign for bitcoin?Bitcoin Seesaws but Holds at $17.8KBy James RubinBitcoin looked primed to continue its momentum this week before U.S. central bank Chair Jerome Powell damped investors' mood with a pointed reminder that the Fed was not finished with its monetary hawkishness even after lowering its latest interest rate hike to 50 basis points.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $17,811, roughly where it stood 24 hours earlier. BTC had topped $18,300 earlier in the day following an unexpected slowing in November's inflation data and the Fed's anticipated dovish turn. But in a press conference following the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) rate announcement, Powell returned to a months-long theme that rising prices presented the biggest threat to the economy.“50 basis points is still a historically large increase and we still have some ways to go,” Powell said at a press conference following the FOMC statement.Ether followed a similar pattern, rising earlier in the day before dropping to trade at $1,308, down about a percentage point from Tuesday, same time. Most other major cryptocurrencies were in the red, albeit not by much with UNI, the token of decentralized exchange Uniswap, and LINK, the token of software platform Chainlink, falling 3.2% and 3.1%, respectively.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently sank 0.33%.Equity indexes troubled by Powell's comments closed down with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 off 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Tuesday's consumer price index fell to 7.1%, lower than the 7.3% projected by economists responding to a FactSet survey.The Fed's latest rate increase the federal funds target range to 4.25%-4.5%, the highest level in 15 years. Powell has signaled that the terminal rate – the peak rate for the current hiking cycle, expected sometime next year – will likely be over 5%. The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge each other to borrow and lend money.Meanwhile, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) are introducing a bill to crack down on money laundering and financing of terrorists and rogue nations via cryptocurrency. The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act would bring know-your-customer (KYC) rules to crypto participants such as wallet providers and miners and prohibit financial institutions from transacting with digital asset mixers, which are tools designed to obscure the origin of funds.Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, noted in an email that the current Congress, which is in its final weeks, is unlikely to pass the legislation, but that ""the Act would address some national security concerns as it requires crypto firms to play by the same rules that apply to banks and traditional firms.""'Dr. Copper' Offers Encouragement for Bitcoin InvestorsBy Glenn Williams Jr.Bitcoin’s correlation with copper, which moved into positive territory following the Thanksgiving holiday, has continued to rise.The increase is significant, given copper’s traditional link to economic health. Analysts often view copper as a proxy for growth, affectionately calling it “Dr. Copper” for its professorial ability to forecast trends. So copper doing well bodes well for the economy, which bodes well for bitcoin.Markets have been looking favorably upon copper, with the price of its futures contract increasing 8% over the last three weeks. If historic relationships hold true, this trend would imply market confidence about U.S. economic prospects.By contrast, bitcoin (BTC) has maintained a strong negative correlation with the U.S. Dollar index (DXY). Investors will be watching this index in the weeks ahead, particularly after the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) trimmed its interest rate hike to 50 basis points on Wednesday from its previous, more aggressive 75 bps increases.Still, Fed Chair Jerome Powell was unexpectedly hawkish in his comments following the rate announcement, reiterating long-held concerns about inflation.Will bitcoin follow Dr. Copper’s prescription or follow the lead of the U.S. Dollar Index?

BTC was trading as high as $18,356 right before the Fed’s announcement, over the $18,000 mark for the first time since early November. It’s up 0.5% in the past 24 hours. “Cryptos are getting dragged down as the dollar rallies with the return of risk aversion,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst of the Americas at Oanda, wrote in a Wednesday note.Equity markets also turned red, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closing down 0.76%.

A high volume node represents areas of significant price agreement, which often coincides with slower price movement.By contrast, low volume nodes represent areas of low activity.

122,"Bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK), lowered its year-end 2023 hashrate or computing power guidance to 16 exahash per second (EH/s), from 22.4 EH/s previously, citing delays in building a mining facility by one of its partners, Lancium.The miner announced a partnership with energy technology company Lancium earlier this year for an initial 200 megawatts (MW) of power capacity in west Texas, which translates to 6.6 EH/s of hashrate, with an option for an additional 300MW in the future.However, Lancium informed CleanSpark that capital constraints have affected its ability to meet its commitments, according to a statement. The expected completion dates have been pushed into late 2023 or even later, which led to the guidance cut by the miner.Crypto miners have been severely affected by the current crypto winter as the price of bitcoin has slumped, killing their revenue. Meanwhile, energy prices have soared, increasing their costs. This has resulted in one of the biggest mining data center operators in the U.S., Compute North, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September, while big players such as Core Scientific (CORZ), Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Greenidge Generation (GREE) have all said they are experiencing a liquidity crunch.In addition to the guidance cut, CleanSpark said that its fourth-quarter revenue rose 235% compared to the same period last year. Meanwhile, its net loss widened by 683% year over year, mainly due to the impairment of goodwill and bitcoin balances as well as non-cash charges due to modification of equity instruments, the company said in the statement.Shares of the miner have fallen 12% on Thursday, while the price of bitcoin also declined about 2%. CleanSpark's shares have fared slightly better than most peers, falling about 79% this year, compared to other miners such as Core Scientific (CORZ) and Marathon Digital (MARA), whose shares have declined more than 80% this year.Read more: Bitcoin Miner Core Scientific's Lender Wants to Give Miner $72M to Avoid BankruptcyUPDATE (Dec. 15, 16:09 UTC): Updates share price performance in the last paragraph.",2022/12/14
123,"Just after a better-than-expected U.S. inflation report had left investors in a good mood, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had to come in and spoil it.The bitcoin (BTC) price fell Wednesday as traders reacted to the Fed's signals that monetary-tightening could continue well into 2023, even as the pace slows.Instead of dwelling on the short-term retreat, investors might be better off focusing on the fact that, however briefly, they got a glimpse this week of a price trend resembling anything remotely bullish. It's something traders haven’t seen or even contemplated since the initial tremors in early November that ultimately led to the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange.Lingering fears of FTX-related contagion risk still permeate markets, while looming concerns about Binance’s reserves and stability have sprouted as well. Up to this point, bitcoin has performed poorer than normal in December, while leading into traditionally bearish January. Whether concerns about Binance are grounded in legitimacy or rooted in post-FTX fear could be clearer in coming weeks.In the meantime let’s unpack this week’s move up past $18,000 for the first time since Nov. 10. Does the move have real merit, or is it just a short term relief rally? It could be that – just the mere fact that we're asking the question is a sign for optimism.Historically, on a seasonal basis, the market is not entering a time of the year of strong performance.From a price-chart perspective, bitcoin’s roughly $17,900 level moves the asset into a “low volume node” region – possibly indicating the potential for quick price moves.Volume nodes can be identified as zones on a price chart using the Volume Profile Visible Range tool, showing trading activity by price point.

Bitcoin has now entered that same space, but to the upside this time around.The next high volume node appears near $19,100, approximately 7% higher than current prices.Momentum for bitcoin has jumped 23% since Monday when using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) as a proxy for measurement. The movement from 51 to 63 reflects an uptick in buying pressure while coinciding with an increase in volume.Now – the macroeconomic picture. Inflation concerns still linger, but they're moving toward less panic-worthy levels.As expected, on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point), after four consecutive 75 bps hikes.Powell's comments indicated that the U.S. central bank is committed to fighting inflation and can’t stop too soon, but that any changes to the underlying economic data will be evaluated.The tone was hawkish, and the market reacted accordingly.Bond market yields responded to Fed's comments with increased yields for two-year U.S. Treasurys, which maintains an inverted yield curve when set against its 10-year counterpart.The increase in short-term interest rates implies questions on short term economic prospects, and expectations for more aggressive Fed interest rate hikes.As market prices reflect future expectations for an asset’s prospects, the notion that we are a step closer to the end of Fed tightening is a welcome sight, even if that has yet to come into full focus.",2022/12/14
124,"Investment bank B Riley, one of bitcoin miner Core Scientific's (CORZ) top lenders, has proposed a new $72 million financing plan so the struggling company can avoid bankruptcy.""In our opinion, the vast majority of Core Scientific's issues are self-imposed and can be corrected in conjunction with an open, transparent discussion and ongoing participation with its creditors and equity holders,"" B Riley said in a statement. The investment bank, which has an outstanding loan of $42 million with Core, said that its proposed new financing will be ""on favorable terms, providing more than two years of runway for the company to achieve profitability.""B Riley said it is prepared to fund the first $40 million of the new financing immediately, with ""zero contingencies."" The remainder of the financing is contingent on all principal payments to equipment lenders being suspended at bitcoin prices of $18,500 and below. Above that threshold, however, free cash flow from operations will be distributed to equipment lenders.Read more: Bondholders of Troubled Bitcoin Miner Core Scientific Said to Be Working With Lawyers: ReportCore, which was the largest bitcoin miner by computing power, first warned of the risk of bankruptcy in late October, sending its shares plummeting about 80% on Nasdaq. In November, it reiterated that it may run out of money by the end of this year. Core Scientific is one of several miners struggling to keep afloat as rising energy prices increase costs, while stubbornly low bitcoin prices slash revenues. The company went public in Jan. 20 after merging with Power & Digital Infrastructure Acquisition in a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transaction.B Riley said that Core has about $300 million in total loans that have a very short maturity and were taken on by the miner during the peak of the crypto market. ""These debts were incurred as part of an aggressive, ill-conceived strategy by the company to continue to build out power facilities and expand miners while never selling bitcoin on hand and never hedging prices,"" the investment bank said in a statement.A culmination of these strategies has led the company to sell all the bitcoins in its inventory at a loss, which led the company to its current state, the bank added in its statement.The shares of the miners rose as much as 76% on Thursday but have fallen 97% this year, while shares of peers such as Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) have both tumbled more than 80% over the same time period.Read more: Bitcoin Miners’ FTX Contagion Exposure May Amplify Industry PainUPDATE (Dec. 15, 16:06 UTC): Updates share price performance in the last paragraph.

125,"The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point) as it continues to slow the economy and moderate price increases.The decision brings the federal funds target range to 4.25%-4.5%, the highest level in 15 years. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the terminal rate – the peak rate for the current hiking cycle, expected sometime next year – will likely be over 5%.Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by 2.5% since the 2 p.m. ET (19:00 UTC) decision, to around $17,740.Wednesday’s rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed’s monetary policy panel, signals a slowdown in the pace of hikes by the Fed, which for the past four consecutive meetings has raised rates in 75 basis point increments.“50 basis points is still a historically large increase and we still have some ways to go,” Powell said at a press conference following the FOMC statement.Inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) continues to slow on a yearly basis: November’s CPI report showed that inflation rose 7.1%, down from 7.7% in October, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.Officials with the U.S. central bank had said over the past month that it might be appropriate to slow the pace of interest rate hikes while the economy adjusts to the higher level of borrowing costs. However, ""ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate,"" according to the FOMC statement.The FOMC also released a new set of economic projections (SEP) and “dot plot,” representing top Fed officials' projections for the next year. Ten out of 19 central bankers who are part of the committee expect the terminal rate to be higher than 5% but lower than 5.25% by the end of 2023, the dot plot shows.For 2024, the majority of dots were put in the range of 4% to 4.25%, suggesting that rates will continue to stay elevated for a while.“The most important decision is no longer the speed,” Powell said, but rather for how long the Fed needs to stay restrictive until inflation comes down significantly, which he said will “be some time.”“It’s our judgment today that we’re not at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance yet,” he said.UPDATE (Dec. 14, 19:18 UTC): Added information about economic projections.UPDATE (Dec. 14, 19:47): Added comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.",2022/12/14
126,"In the early years, people left Wall Street for crypto because they believed in the future of this industry. It was fundamentally different from traditional finance. Then somewhere during the last bull run, the calculus changed. We started filtering candidates not on their crypto chops, but based on who went to Harvard or MIT or had high-pedigree parents.One of the first questions when you meet someone new used to be, “How did you get into crypto?” and the response would usually start with the year, followed by why they left corporate America to work at a startup for half the pay of Wall Street.Jenna Pilgrim is the managing partner of Mayflower Capital, a firm building teams in cryptocurrency and Web3. She has been building teams in the cryptocurrency industry since 2015, with tenures at the Blockchain Research Institute, Bloq and Streambed Media. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.Somewhere in the bull markets, we forgot this first-principle-based approach. We started filtering candidates based on their successes in Web 2 or traditional finance (TradFi), thinking they could easily learn the lingo of crypto enough to get by. We brought traders from Wall Street and entrusted them with huge books of tokens, assuming it would be the same. Derivatives are derivatives, right?I keep asking myself how the hell we allowed Sam Bankman-Fried and his band of new-coiners to get as big as they did without sharing our same set of shared values. I’ve resolved that it comes down to a failure of contextual understanding of where we have been, and where we as an industry would like to go.If you build a company with a CEO who only cares about making as much money as possible at any cost, you’ll attract talent who think the same. If you build a company that doesn’t care about privacy or decentralization, guess what? Your teams won’t care about that either. One largely overlooked feature of the FTX debacle is their diversion – and in some cases complete rejection – of the collectively created first-principles. Organizations like the Chamber of Digital Commerce and the Blockchain Association have been working for more than 10 years in Washington, D.C., to educate and advocate for sensible regulation. Then in 2020, Sam comes out of nowhere and starts speaking for all of us?I got into crypto in 2015 because I believed we could build a better, fairer system that worked for everyone. We started this to get away from centralization and blind trust of people and institutions. The first successful companies were built with people who believed in a few founding principles, all to varying degrees: decentralization, privacy, self-custody, and removal of middlemen. Don’t trust, verify. Can’t be evil. The list goes on.Read more: Who's Who in the FTX Inner CircleWe, the community of investors, users and crypto natives, allowed SBF to build FTX in a vacuum that didn’t follow these shared principles. FTX was notorious for not playing well with others, for bribing talent with equity and tokens, and for using influencer feedback loops to bewitch retail investors (not to mention regulators, lawmakers and journalists) who didn’t know better.FTX built a team all made up of new-coiners, teaching them to mainline his Effective Altruism ""kool-aid"" until their blood ran blue. That talent base obviously couldn’t be trusted to build sensible decentralized systems because, well, they had never built them before. They were missing the industry exposure and understanding that only comes from salty wounds of the past. I wouldn’t be surprised if most of the employees of FTX leave the crypto ecosystem altogether without a second thought. Honestly, the rest of us wouldn’t miss them.Crypto hiring is a fundamentally flawed process. We as an industry are (commercially) about 10 years old. We have a few things figured out by now: custody, wallets, block explorers, price indexes. The list goes on. We haven’t quite got lending and yields right, but there’s still time. Ten years of battle scars means that there are people who have direct experience in these areas, but somehow they aren’t getting to the jobs they know how to do.Someone who spent five years in crypto after five in investment banking is a far superior candidate to someone who spent 20 years at JPMorgan without having ever touched crypto at all. My least favorite statement to hear as a recruiter is, “I’ve been following the space for a while ...” I’m sorry, no. A candidate like that wouldn’t have the foggiest idea how to approach risk or compliance or custody or cross-border payments for their international customers.There is no substitute for the lessons learned in an early stage crypto company trying to secure basic bank accounts.There is no substitute for knowing how to receive investor dollars in USDC and manage a crypto treasury.Read more: 'A Complete Failure of Corporate Controls': What Investors and Accountants Missed in FTX’s AuditsThere is no substitute for knowing the cause/effect of a decentralized community being divided on an issue, and what a hard fork would mean for their business.There is no substitute for understanding the knock-on effects of a hard fork after a hack.You get the gist. At some point we shouldn’t have to watch this movie again.The thing the two aforementioned candidates differ on is context. Context can never be undervalued when it comes to building a principle-driven team. Stop it with the non-contextualized tradfi converts, please.I have heard time and again, “They’re in HR, they don’t need to understand crypto.” Well yes, they do. Human Resource managers need the same industry context that hiring managers have, if not more, because they need to span across disciplines and job functions to filter the right candidates. Their process needs to be ideology focused, not competency based.Many job postings aren’t reaching the right audiences because no one fits the mold of a traditional profile. Most crypto people didn’t go to an Ivy League school or graduate top of their class. They mined ether (ETH) in their dorm rooms in college or maybe even bought drugs on Silk Road (or its successors) with bitcoin (BTC). They blogged in 2014 about the failures of the modern banking system. They traded their way to moderate success on Kraken and KuCoin and learned about short squeezes from GameStop and Robinhood. They learned what custody was by losing their crypto on a defunct exchange. Sorry, there are no effective filtering metrics.The first question in a job interview at a crypto company should be along the lines of:“What is money?”“What is decentralization?”“Why does bitcoin matter?”“Do you own any form of cryptocurrency?”“Do you know what a wallet is, and do you have one?”We need to recognize our own bias and get off the job description high horse. We need to spend our days meeting as many people as we can, through the people we already know. We need to trust those around us to verify and vouch for good talent, then just give it a shot – regardless of whether they meet our bogus idea of what we think we need.We have to get crypto people back to work.Teams that grow using this human-first strategy are more resilient, initiative-driven and make better decisions. Companies foster a collectivist culture where people understand their role in the company, and the companies’ responsibility to foster the growth of the whole ecosystem. Employees are happier too, because they don’t feel they are working in the world alone.The community of crypto leaders have been very vocal over the last few weeks about what should have been done better and what we can do next time. Putting the too-little-too-late narrative aside, the biggest thing we can do now is back founders and hire teams who share similar fundamental ideologies to crypto itself. We must educate everyone in the company about these ideologies so decisions are centered around the success of the whole ecosystem, not just the success of one entity.",2022/12/14
127,"Remember the halcyon days of DeFi summer? Bitcoin was roaring, the Grayscale arbitrage trade was wide open, the basis trade was just getting going, traditional finance (TradFi) interest rates were plummeting and the broader public started to realize that a fully liquid 10% on stablecoins looked pretty darn good compared to the 0% offered in their savings accounts. Maybe we couldn’t point exactly to what was “alpha” in that spread, but numbers like that allowed us a fair amount of leeway in deciding that “this is a better way.”Alex McDougall is president and CEO of Stablecorp Inc. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023.In these early days, decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized finance (CeFi) were yielding similar rates and there had never been a default in the industry because all loans were far overcollateralized and there was real economic value in posting bitcoin (BTC) as collateral and borrowing stables or fiat. Liquidity was also well matched because all loans were “open term” and any redemption requests could be met by liquidity on hand or calling back loans. I wrote a year in review article for this very series in December 2020 that I still stand by, mostly outlining why the industry worked based on the above dynamics.Smash cut to today’s smoking wasteland of shattered dreams, shattered trust and near-zero yields. What happened? Was any of it real? Most importantly, what’s next?Let’s spend the minimum amount of time on what happened because, honestly, it’s relatively simple, and the bad actors and details will be extensively documented in court cases for decades to come. The (criminally) short version:Read more: Crypto 2023: It's Sanctions Season | OpinionVery little in digital asset yield land is truly “new.” Most of the lending models that were “created” or popularized through the rise of DeFi are actually just more public versions of models usually executed deep within gigantic financial institutions – securities lending being the main one.However, in the zeal to dispense with links to Tradfi, the fundamentals of operating those models – asset liability matching, correlation and contagion risk, collateralization models and robust underwriting models – got left by the wayside. While blockchain technology makes the operation of these pools and models much more transparent, effective and efficient (whether CeFi or DeFi), these are not technology platforms. They are financial risk trading engines, and the finance part of DeFi cannot be forgotten.Trust has been shattered in the digital yield space. Platforms that have gone through bankruptcies or have cut off liquidity will likely never recover, and this will leave a very long lasting impression on those looking to redeploy into this space. The “I pay you 12% and you don’t ask questions” model is gone for now (although never say never …). The first step in creating new models is a step function improvement in transparency. It has always been shocking how opaque lending platforms have been in an industry as transparent and “on-chain” as blockchain. Fortunately, because of that very same transparent nature of blockchain, quite a bit of knowledge can be gained about loan books, volumes and liquidity from an outsider’s perspective, simply by monitoring on-chain flows from known wallets.Going forward, there will be a significant amount of pressure on purely CeFi companies to disclose more information about their loan books and asset deployment strategies. There will also be a greater use of on-chain analytics tools to bootstrap that transparency where it is not forthcoming.There is also an entirely new model that has sprung up around this desire for transparency, colloquially known as “CeDeFi,” which refers to CeFi-style lending using DeFi rails. With this type of platform you have (mostly) the same level of transparency as a DeFi platform (i.e,. you can see the full loan book in real time including named borrowers) as well as any collateral posted and some summary risk scores on the borrowers. Borrowers are underwritten by “pool delegates” – third parties who do the diligence and also stake “first loss” capital into the pool to align incentives.See also: Where Is the Ethereum Virtual Machine Headed in 2023? (Hint: Beyond Ethereum) | OpinionOne critical evolution in this space has been the bifurcation of two schools of thought and action around collateral. Collateral, particularly in DeFi, has always been used as a hack or replacement for underwriting. You don’t need to underwrite a borrower on Compound if they are posting 150% of ether (ETH) that will be liquidated at 120%. However, at the same time, it was constantly acknowledged that collateral was inefficient and exclusionary by nature. To participate in DeFi, you needed to already have assets to post as collateral, and with overcollateralization you are by definition taking assets out of circulation.Before the meltdown, the truly institutional lending desks already had quite sophisticated underwriting processes for their counterparties, and the ones who followed them generally stayed out of the news. Now, with the increased push in transparency, underwriting practices are coming to light like never before, and with increased default data it is becoming possible to battle test these models and begin to build legitimacy.There have been other novel structures that have sprung up in the lead up to and in the aftermath of the meltdown to help manage the tail risks associated with this type of relatively new exposure.The first is DeFi insurance such as Nexus or Unslashed. Effectively, DeFi insurance acts similarly to any other insurance policy where an event happens and you are able to file a claim for compensation. Except instead of an insurance company underwriting and selling you the policy, it is an insurance pool that you are buying insurance from and the providers of the capital are other participants on the platform. If you put capital into a pool and it is bought out as insurance on the other side, you cannot remove your capital until either someone else puts in new capital or an insurance policy is cancelled. In this way, all policies are always fully reserved with assets. These platforms are new and they are certainly not Lloyd’s of London, but they do work. With the UST depeg there are now myriad case studies of users covering their risks via these insurance policies.The second is tranching-type structures like that employed on Idle Finance. Idle employs a methodology where it takes exposure to underlying CeFi and DeFi yield generating pools (and CeDeFi pools) and tranches the exposure between a junior and a senior tranche that are priced differently. The idea is that in a loss scenario the junior tranche is eaten away first before any losses are passed onto the senior tranche. To a certain extent, this type of tranching plays the same role as collateral in that there is a support system of assets pledged to the senior tranche that is eaten up first.When everything is transparent and written out in code, platforms become infinitely “composable” and it becomes possible to build optimization layers or additional incentivization layers on top of other platforms. Morpho Labs is a great example of this. It takes the core engine of platforms like Compound or Aave and enhances the matching engine to turn it into a P2P network that both increases yields as well as decreases borrowing costs purely by improving the technology instead of stepping up any risk or duration curves.Finally, it’s crucial to examine the current reality and build models for resiliency. TradFi yields are now routinely higher than what is available in the arbitrage-driven digital yield space. This likely won’t always be the case but it may be for some time. So breaking down those barriers between the structures able to access arbitrage-driven yields and those accessing TradFi yields, particularly “risk-free” type yields, becomes an extremely valuable source of advantage for the next generation of digital asset yield products.Setting a risk and yield floor with the TradFi market and opportunistically seeking to enhance that yield with composable, optimized, underwritten, appropriately collateralized, insured, transparent digital yield solutions is what will bootstrap this next generation of yield platforms.Finally, it will take time to rebuild, but don’t quit on the yield space. There will be more arbitrage, there has been exponential infrastructure progress, there is more and more data to train appropriate risk models and there are more and more innovative ways to manage unique and tail risks inherent in the space. The first inning ended with a fastball to the shin, but crypto has survived utter devastation before and the yield industry will rebuild itself faster, more efficiently and more composable than before.",2022/12/14
128,"Indians have lost interest in trading on local crypto exchanges since the government began imposing taxes on profits and transactions, data from AppTweak and SimilarWeb shows.However, interest in Binance, the world's largest exchange by trading volume, has remained more or less constant. The exchange is not based in India and thus is not subject to its jurisdiction, even if its users are.Visits to Indian exchanges Wazir X, CoinDCX, CoinSwitch Kuber and ZebPay fell 80% between Feb. 1 – when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government announced a 30% tax on crypto profits and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on all transactions – and Oct. 31, according to SimilarWeb. App downloads fell 93%, AppTweak shows.The tax on crypto gains kicked in starting April 1 and was set at the same level as taxes on earnings from online casinos. But the industry was hit harder by the second tax, which took effect July 1 and was aimed “more for tracking transactions,” Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.“The real killer has been the 1% TDS on each transaction,” said Ajeet Khurana, a crypto analyst and founder of Web3 platform Reflexical. “Because effectively this tax tells people not to transact. This has dampened sentiments the most.”While trading volumes crashed as much as 70% on Indian exchanges days after the imposition of the tax regime, the data shows website traffic for Binance remained more or less constant from June.As for downloads, by July 22 – around three weeks after the start of the transaction tax – unique installations of Binance overtook all Indian exchanges.“Effectively we have gifted volume to Binance,” Khurana said. “People will feel compelled to trade on international exchanges such as Binance because Binance will not implement the TDS.”The move isn’t necessarily indicative of tax evasion, Khurana said. A notification from the income tax regulator said residents are supposed to calculate and file taxes themselves when an international exchange doesn’t implement TDS because it doesn’t fall under Indian jurisdiction.In response to Parliamentary questions from opposition member of parliament Vivek K. Tankha on Tuesday, Pankaj Choudhary of the Finance Ministry said it does not register foreign crypto exchanges, and the same tax rules apply to anyone trading crypto irrespective of whether the exchange is registered in India or abroad.The response also revealed that the government earned $7.3 million through TDS since its implementation.""The amount of tax earned by the government shows that the actual net volume of all the exchanges combined is around 6,000 crores ($727 million) in Q3 2022 which is way below as compared to 2021, when the crypto market witnessed a massive bull run,"" said Shivam Thakral, CEO of Indian exchange BuyUcoin.The “poorly designed 30% capital gains tax on crypto assets and sledgehammer approach of 1% TDS on exchange-traded transactions coincided with [the] global rout in cryptocurrencies to kill Indians' interest in cryptocurrencies,” said Subhash Garg, a former secretary in the Finance Ministry’s Department of Economic Affairs.That’s evident not only in transactions but also in interactions with mobile platforms.

About a quarter of the conference was dedicated to the topic of “Latin America: Unlimited Potential Blockchain Land.”Read more: Paraguay Votes Down Crypto Regulatory Bill in a Blow to Crypto Mining IndustryArgentina’s BitPatagonia and Paraguay’s Penguin Digital were invited to present, while Yiding (Fred) He, Bitmain’s director of business development, talked up the region’s potential, although he cautioned that it’s important to find the right partner to work with in Latin America.Bitmain itself is looking into opportunities in the region, as are many other major firms.The availability of cheap electricity in Europe, North America and former Soviet countries has dried up this year, partly because inflation and the war in Ukraine are driving up energy prices and partly because regulators and grids are hitting the brakes on mining as they assess what effects it has on their communities.Read more: Canada's Manitoba Province Enacts 18-Month Moratorium on New Crypto MiningAs a result, companies were looking at Latin America, a region that still has untapped energy potential. Paraguay, in particular, boasts a relatively low price of under five cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) and as low as 35 cents. Many industrial miners in the U.S. are facing prices over that.But Paraguay’s national grid operator and the government have asked miners to pay as much as 60% over the industrial price of electricity. A bill to stop that plan was voted down in the Paraguayan legislature on Dec. 6, meaning miners’ margins will be far thinner than what they had calculated before.Meanwhile, high energy prices have already thinned out miners’ margins around the world, leading to some high-profile liquidity crunches.In previous conferences held at exotic locations, participants would often take meetings in the pool, or at least by the pool, and take time to catch up before getting to business. But this time, meetings were far more serious, and miners were bringing to the table printed financial presentations to now-scrupulous financiers, one attendee remarked.The mining industry has been hit hard by the crypto winter. Miners’ direct exposure to flailing companies like bankrupt crypto exchange FTX appears to be minimal and mostly through intermediary companies such as crypto lender bankrupt BlockFi and others. (That is with the exception of Celsius Network, a bankrupt crypto lender that was operating a mining arm.) But they have felt the effects of the crypto winter as much as anyone. Miners’ revenues have declined massively, along with the price of bitcoin (BTC), while energy prices have been soaring.Big companies in the mining industry like Compute North and Core Scientific (CORZ) have been affected, along with smaller firms that face higher energy prices. Few, like CleanSpark (CLSK), have been in a position to take advantage of the situation to buy distressed assets.During the last dinner in Cancun, closed to most attendees of the event, Micree Zhan, co-founder and chairman of the board at Bitmain, unveiled the price of a special batch of new S19 XP Hyd. mining machines. The price was planned to be $19 per terahash (TH). But Zhan, speaking with a hoarse voice, decided on the spot to lower it to $18.5/TH in light of the revelations about FTX and how the market reacted. (Terahash is a measure of computing power.)Read more: Bitcoin Miners’ FTX Contagion Exposure May Amplify Industry Pain",2022/12/14
130,"While bitcoin and stock investors are cheering Tuesday's softer-than-expected U.S. consumer price index (CPI) print, one expert suggests slowing inflation is not a reason to buy risk assets.The CPI was 7.1% on an annual basis in November, slower than a Refinitiv consensus estimate of 7.3% and down from October's 7.7% reading. Core inflation, which strips the volatile food and energy components, dropped to 6.0% from 6.3% the month before.The data, which strengthen expectations for a slowdown in the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest-rate increase path and a pivot to liquidity easing in second-half 2023, lifted risk assets. Bitcoin jumped over 3% to $18,000 following the CPI release, the highest since Nov. 10, CoinDesk data shows. The S&P 500 gained 0.7%, while the dollar index dropped to a six-month low.Optimism stemming from an assumption that once the Fed turns dovish institutions will again have access to cheaper money may be premature, however. Slower inflation often portends a decline in earnings per share (EPS), a barometer of corporate profitability. And that usually weighs on stocks and zaps overall risk appetite in financial markets. Bitcoin has moved in lockstep with equities since last year.""Those who find a lower inflation print a good opportunity to buy risk assets should look away now,"" Andreas Steno Larsen, founder and CEO of Steno Research, noted in the inflation review published Tuesday. ""Remember that the PPI (and the CPI, for that matter) is a leading indicator for EPS ... And if we allow the oil future to predict PPI, then we are in for negative EPS growth already during Q2/Q3-2023,"" he wrote, referring to the producer price index.The PPI measures the average movements of prices received by domestic producers for goods and services sold on the domestic or international market. The U.S. PPI follows oil price movements closely and serves as a leading indicator for CPI.""This is NOT priced into expectations for equities. A revisit of the 3500-3600 should be on the cards for S&P 500,"" Larsen said. The benchmark U.S. stock index closed at 4019.65 on Tuesday.The chart shows PPI will likely turn negative in the second quarter of next year. The projection is based on the price of oil futures.Historically, EPS growth has closely tracked the PPI, meaning corporate profitability could take a hit in the second quarter, putting downward pressure on risk assets.",2022/12/14
131,"The past year in the digital asset market has been characterized by a series of negative shocks, triggered initially by the collapse of Terra/LUNA, Citi (C) said in a research report Monday looking back on the year.“Leverage, volatility and interest have faded as investors battle with declining prices,” analysts led by Joseph Ayoub wrote. “Retail interest has broadly diminished as prices have declined,” and this has “coincided with a more general decline in volatility.”Institutional interest has also declined. This “loss of trust” followed the failure of many centralized entities, and is reflected in exchange-traded product (ETP) flows, which have remained negative throughout the year, the report said.Against a broader macro backdrop of inflation concerns, rising interest rates and tightening financial conditions, total crypto market cap has declined by about 61% compared to an 18% drop for the S&P 500 index, the report added.The bank says the bankruptcies of crypto exchange FTX and lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital were failures of centralized entities rather than decentralized entities, “perhaps signifying the resilience of decentralized finance protocols.” Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on a blockchain.Bitcoin open interest saw a significant decline, the note said. It started the year at more than $23 billion and has dropped to around $9 billion. Leverage has also largely declined. Open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts held by investors and represents active positions.The bank notes there is still over $150 billion in market cap across stablecoins. This type of cryptocurrency saw only 5% net redemptions in 2022. However, relative declines show different investor behavior and diverging confidence in stablecoins, with tether (USDT) losing as much as $10 billion in market cap, while USD coin (USDC) stayed roughly level and Binance USD (BUSD) increased.Spot trading volumes have remained resilient despite falling crypto prices, and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes have grown in recent weeks following the collapse of FTX. The demise of FTX has “further bolstered policymaker calls for crypto regulation, placing a greater emphasis on consumer protection,” according to the note.Read more: Goldman Sachs Sees Gold Outperforming Bitcoin in the Longer Term",2022/12/14

Bitcoin gained 3.7%, hitting $17,805.Bitcoin recently hit a one-month high earlier this week ahead of U.S. inflation data, and its dominance has cracked 41%, CoinDesk previously reported. Digital assets are generally rising as traders expect the Federal Reserve to slow down its inflation-fighting interest rate hikes.""This is the main trigger in the increase in prices,"" Raphael Kim, the founder of Seoul-based crypto VC Reframe, told CoinDesk. Kim said the lower-than-expected data in the CPI was a relief to many traders, who are building a post-FTX investment narrative.Many other tokens on the CoinDesk 20 were up during the Asia afternoon trading session, in particular those associated with layer 1 tokens including Avalanche (AVAX0, up 7.3% to $13.69, Solana (SOL) up 7% to $13.94, and Cosmos (ATOM) up 6.9% to $9.92.Data from CoinGlass shows that traders who held short positions have faced immense liquidation pressure over the last 24 hours. In total, $119.51 million in positions have been liquidated, with 83% of them being shorts.Meanwhile, Binance’s exchange token, BNB, is up 4% to $274.Nansen data shows that the netflow to the exchange flipped positive during the last 24 hours to $715 million. During the Tuesday trading day outflow hit nearly $2 billion over regulatory concerns and news that the exchange was temporarily suspending USDC withdrawals.Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, Binance founder and CEO, tweeted that he welcomes the “stress test” and suggested that all centralized exchanges should have similar regular tests. While the exchange doesn’t appear to have a liquidity problem at this time, CZ has warned staff to expect “turbulent times” ahead.Data from Nansen shows that Binance currently has reserves of $57.4 billion. OKX, the next exchange on the list, has reserves of $6.7 billion, while Crypto.com, in third, has reserves of $3.4 billion.",2022/12/14
133,"The outlook for risk assets appears bright after Tuesday's U.S. inflation report that affirmed the expected slowing of the Federal Reserve's liquidity tightening.Bitcoin (BTC), however, could remain under pressure because several miners are likely to go bust, overshadowing improving macroeconomic conditions, according to investment giant VanEck.""Bitcoin will test $10,000-$12,000 in Q1 amid a wave of miner bankruptcies, which will mark the low point of the crypto winter,"" Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, said in the 2023 outlook.This year, bitcoin miners, or those responsible for making coins, have been caught between rising operational costs and falling bitcoin prices.Miners' profitability is closely tied to bitcoin's price, given they receive the cryptocurrency as a reward for solving complex mathematical puzzles to verify transactions on the blockchain. The rewards received are often liquidated to fund operational costs.And so, when the price crashes, as it has this year by 61%, it leads to miner capitulation – a situation where weak miners exit the market, selling their reserves and causing the price to drop further. In a worst-case scenario, the capitulation could lead to a death spiral.Miners have been running down their coin stash to cope with adverse market conditions. Data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shows balance held in miner wallets has declined by over 25,000 BTC (US$444 million) since July, hitting a 14-month low of 1.818 million BTC.The trend could continue as most companies engaged in mining are bleeding cash.""The MVIS Global Digital Assets Mining Index median market cap is now only $180 [million], with nearly all constituents burning cash and trading well below book value. With bitcoin mining largely unprofitable, given recent higher electricity prices and lower bitcoin prices, we predict many miners will restructure or merge,"" Sigel wrote.A drop to $12,000 would mean an 82% drawdown from the record high of $69,000 registered in November 2021. The previous two bear markets ran out of steam at roughly 85% drawdowns from the the-then record highs.Sigel expects bitcoin to bounce back to $30,000 in the second half of 2023.""Lower inflation, easing energy concerns, a possible truce in Ukraine, and a turnaround in M2 supply will power the start of a new bull market,"" Sigel noted, adding that an oil-exporting nation would add the cryptocurrency to its sovereign wealth fund.VanEck also expects financial institutions to tokenize more than $10 billion in off-chain assets and a new decentralized stablecoin to reach the $1 billion market cap.The investment giant also sees Brazil becoming one of the most crypto-friendly countries of the world and tokenizing a portion of sovereign debt offerings on blockchain, Ripple losing the Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit in the U.S. and Ethereum enabling withdrawals from the Beacon Chain.",2022/12/14
134,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin and other cryptos liked the sound of inflation slowing by more than expected in November.Insights: The South Korean city of Busan wants to be a blockchain hub, but it is forgetting a few inconvenient truths.Inflation Slows, Bitcoin AcceleratesBy James RubinFormer FTX boss and crypto wunderkind Sam Bankman-Fried went to a Bahamian jail, was denied bail and verbally pummeled at a congressional hearing by the executive who replaced him as the exchange's CEO.Binance saw a torrent of withdrawals hours after a report that U.S. prosecutors were considering criminal charges against the exchange. Shares of crypto-friendly bank Silvergate plummeted to a two-year low.The digital asset industry had a memorable 24 hours, though not for the reasons it would prefer.Yet, crypto markets only had eyes for encouraging inflation figures from November.Bitcoin was recently trading at $17,765, a 3.2% gain over the past 24 hours, as investors embraced the latest consumer price index (CPI) data, which showed prices rising 7.1%, lower than the 7.3% projected by economists responding to a FactSet survey. The CPI soared over 9% earlier this year.“It’s pretty clear that the back of inflation has been broken,"" Jacob Sansbury, co-founder and CEO of Pluto, a provider of DIY automated investing services for retail investors, wrote to CoinDesk. After all, CPI prints are trailing indicators.""Sansbury added: ""This is an auspicious sign for bitcoin and crypto, along with other risk assets. I’m not saying that a bottom has formed yet fully for the crypto market, but from today’s lower-than-expected CPI print, it’s pretty clear that a bottom is very, very close.""Ether was recently changing hands at $1,319, also up 3.4% from Monday, same time. Most other major cryptos had a solid green hue with AVAX, the token of base layer network Avalanche, and LINK, the token of software platform, Chainlink recently rising 5.8% and 3.2%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently climbed nearly 2.4%.U.S. equity indexes embraced the encouraging CPI figures more quietly as the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 climbed 1% and 0.7%, respectively. The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday also showed core inflation, which excludes more volatile food and fuel costs, increasing 6% versus expectations of 6.2% and offered additional evidence that the U.S. central bank's monetary hawkishness during the past six months has been working.U.S. Treasury yields, which hovered above 4% just a few months ago, sank to 3.5% on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Fed is likely to raise the interest rate 50 basis points (bps), a decline from its streak of four straight 75 bps increases.Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried was remanded to custody and will face an extradition hearing on Feb. 8, 2023. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York unsealed the indictment earlier on Tuesday, announcing that officials were charging Bankman-Fried with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and campaign violation allegations, among other alleged crimes. FTX collapsed last month after CoinDesk found irregularities in its balance sheet.In a Tweet on Tuesday, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao wrote that he welcomed a “stress test” of withdrawals on his exchange to address rising user redemption requests from the platform.Of cryptos' Tuesday price surge, Bob Ras, co-founder of exchange and digital asset ecosystem Sologenic, noted cautiously in an email to CoinDesk that the bounce was not ""as substantial as many had hoped for.""""This isn’t to say there won’t be more upside for major crypto assets here soon. It’s certainly possible, if not likely,"" he wrote, adding that the emergence of China from its Covid lockdowns, could affect inflation in the months ahead.""There’s just too much uncertainty for a full-blown market breakout for crypto assets and equities that are further along the risk curve,” he wrote.By Sam ReynoldsThe South Korean city of Busan seems hell-bent on being a blockchain hub. But will anyone care about its government enterprise blockchain initiatives and quest to build the first city-run crypto exchange?Part of Busan’s status as the ""center of a global digital information ecosystem,"" as government literature describes it, is to integrate blockchain technology into all facets of government service. That means, according to The Korea Herald, that blockchain will be the technology that powers the city’s blockchain-based ID service called B-Pass, B-Fresh, its seafood logistics service, B-Tour, a tour platform, to name a few.The problem is this initiative represents yesterday’s thinking on blockchain. Others have tried integrating permissioned enterprise blockchain into digital infrastructure, and it has failed. A few weeks ago, CoinDesk reported that two major enterprise blockchain projects were ending: Shipping giant Maersk and IBM abandoned TradeLens, a blockchain solution for optimizing supply chains, while the Australian Stock Exchange said it was abandoning a blockchain-powered clearing and settlement system because of a poor cost-benefit ratio.“It’s a Web2 business model, but a little bit of Web3 pixie dust sprinkled on. And once the pixie dust kind of wears off, the value proposition doesn’t look so hot,” Paul Brody, head of blockchain at global consulting giant Ernst & Young, told CoinDesk in a previous article.This is on top of IBM’s blockchain team being effectively wound down in early 2021, and Microsoft discontinuing its Azure cloud services for blockchain a few months later.It isn’t exactly clear how the powers that be in Busan will do anything differently that could change the equation on enterprise blockchain. It’s probably that they can’t.The reason why there hasn’t been a success story in this field is that the technology itself is slow compared to other database platforms.“The problem was the cost in computing power to implement. Blockchain technology is slow and requires a great deal more computer power. Blockchain is the Model T of distributed ledger technology. They are amazing but now dated,” explained Burke Files, a consultant, when asked about why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration isn’t implementing blockchain technology as it once claimed.Busan’s other blockchain venture is the creation of a government-run crypto exchange. In a recent announcement from the city, authorities said that the project had some setbacks, but its still on track for a launch next year.Setbacks indeed. FTX was an early contractor on the project, but that’s obviously not going to work now that the exchange has collapsed and the former CEO has been arrested.Binance and Huobi are also involved, but there’s been little to show for what should be a very simple project.Even if it's built, will anyone want to use it? There will certainly be benefits for traders when it comes to Korean won on-ramps and expedited know-your-customer procedures. But will people be comfortable trading on a government-run platform? It’s a fiat exchange, and many will no doubt find it antithetical to Satoshi’s vision for crypto.Busan might also be opening itself to some major headaches via liabilities.What if the exchange is hacked? Or what if a listed token is the victim of a rug pull? When dealing with offshore exchanges this can add a level of complexity, but serving the city of Busan with a legal notice will be a lot easier for a Korean lawyer then tracking down an exchange that’s registered in Seychelles but has no central office.Of course, the whole thing could be a Potemkin Village designed to look like busy work and extract dollars from tax payers. When CoinDesk visited the Busan blockchain center in August, it was just a co-working space with a handful of people.

135,"Court filings against alleged crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried are shedding more light on the cozy relationship that burned down his empire: the one between crypto exchange FTX and its sister hedge fund Alameda Research.“There was no meaningful distinction between FTX customer funds and Alameda’s own,” the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged Tuesday. Alameda is said to have improperly siphoned $8 billion from customers of the now-bankrupt FTX.In its own suit, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Alameda enjoyed special access to FTX’s trading backend. It could execute trades faster than other customers and was exempt from auto-liquidation, both “unfair advantages,” the suit said. And it could borrow as much money as it liked.Alameda Research was the giant crypto hedge fund and market making firm that Sam Bankman-Fried launched in 2017, well before FTX. It started as a bitcoin arbitrage trader but quickly grew into one of the industry's most influential names, both for its perceived trading prowess and its billions of dollars in capital. Alameda's stature rose in tandem with FTX's; Bankman-Fried ran both until October 2021, when he declared he was leaving the fund.Publicly, the firms claimed to be two different companies that operated ""at an arm's length,"" Alameda's former CEO Caroline Ellison has previously said. But in reality Bankman-Fried ran FTX and Alameda in lockstep, the suits allege. And Alameda was playing with FTX customers' funds.Bankman-Fried, who owns 90% of Alameda, was arrested in the Bahamas Monday and faces criminal money laundering, conspiracy and fraud charges in the U.S. His stunning fall from CEO at the top of the crypto industry to international defendant took just over one month.In that time, the 30-year-old former billionaire had embarked on an aggressive apology tour to cast his role in FTX’s implosion as stupid and reckless but hardly criminal. At times he jumped around questions that probed Alameda’s relationship with FTX and has repeatedly denied knowing of any back doors.The new suits take direct aim at Bankman-Fried’s assertions. He “directed” FTX to let Alameda do things its other customers could not, such as fall below margin requirements on risky bets and execute trades when its accounts were empty, the suits allege. They went on to say these loopholes were baked into FTX’s code at Bankman-Fried’s direction.When institutional customers like Alameda placed trades on FTX they used an API, which is by design more streamlined – and thus faster – than the website retail traders use. But Alameda’s access was faster still. According to the CFTC, it “was able to bypass certain portions” of the FTX API to move “several milliseconds faster” than other big spenders.Part of Alameda’s speed boost was due to its other special privileges. Because it didn’t need to have enough money to place trades, it wholly sidestepped the automatic balance check that other accounts had to clear. This gave Alameda “another significant speed advantage.”Once, when Alameda maxed out its borrowing limit on FTX, Bankman-Fried told staffers to set a ceiling so high it would never be reached, the CFTC alleged. Alameda could theoretically withdraw tens of billions of dollars from FTX.Alameda’s infinite money glitch led to the hedge fund repaying “billions of dollars of loans” using customer deposits, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. It unsealed criminal charges against Sam Bankman-Fried Tuesday after the former FTX CEO’s arrest in the Bahamas.Bankman-Fried tried to hide the relationship between his “personal piggy bank” and FTX by routing money to seemingly unaffiliated bank accounts that Alameda controlled, according to the SEC. FTX used the unassuming account name “fiat@ftx.com” to track its sister company’s multi-billion-dollar debts without raising eyebrows. And Alameda never told third parties that its “loan” was from FTX.Even when FTX tried to untangle its liabilities in 2022 it gave special treatment to Alameda. Bankman-Fried stopped the exchange’s accounting systems from charging interest on the hedge fund’s $8 billion liability (it had done so automatically, per the SEC).Bankman-Fried “drafted and shared a document that questioned whether Alameda should be permanently shut down” in September 2022, months before it imploded, according to the CFTC.His reasoning: Alameda was taking on more risk than it was worth.“I think it might be time for Alameda Research to shut down. Honestly, it was probably time to do that a year ago,” Bankman-Fried wrote in a document titled “We came, we saw, we researched.”At the same time, Bankman-Fried acknowledged that Alameda played such a large role in FTX’s operations that it might be impossible to pull the plug. As FTX's primary market maker, ensured trades went smoothly for all FTX customers, not just itself. Disappearing Alameda would create a shortfall in liquidity that might undermine FTX's value as an exchange.“Given the amount that Alameda is doing, we can’t really shut it down,” he wrote, according to the CFTC.The SEC and CFTC chart Nov. 2 as the day Alameda and FTX began to unravel. On that day, the regulators said CoinDesk published an article that probed Alameda’s extensive FTT token holdings. FTT is a token issued by FTX, and Alameda had billions of dollars of FTT and other FTX-linked tokens on its balance sheet.“On November 6, 2022, in response to this article, the CEO of [rival exchange] Binance tweeted that, “[d]ue to recent revelations that have came (sic) to light,” he would be selling the remainder of his significant FTT holdings, which he acquired during the buyout from FTX seed investment,” the CFTC said, referring to CEO Changpeng Zhao.Binance’s call-to-liquidate tanked the price of FTT and triggered a run on deposits at FTX. One day later, it became clear to the exchange that it didn’t have enough cash to cover for customers, the CFTC said.At the same time, Alameda traders were directed to “sell everything that could be sold” in a mad dash to “generally do anything possible to quickly obtain billions of dollars in capital to send to FTX,” the CFTC said, noting Bankman-Fried played a key role in that effort.Bankman-Fried also planned to use Alameda’s fire sale to fill a hole at FTX US, which was also getting pummeled by withdrawals. Executives there had found “a shortfall they did not understand and were unable to quantify,” per the CFTC. (During his apology tour Bankman-Fried insisted that the U.S. exchange was never insolvent.)“On November 8, Bankman-Fried directed Alameda traders to prioritize meeting FTX US capital requirements and to send excess capital to FTX US. On information and belief, Alameda sent in excess of $185 million to FTX US to fill its shortfall,” the CFTC said.It was just one more criss-cross in the sprawling, unspoken ties between Alameda and all aspects of the FTX empire.",2022/12/13

Inverted yield curves have historically preceded economic recessions and imply declining confidence in short-term economic prospects.In combating inflation, the securities holdings on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet declined to $8.6 trillion for the week, ending Dec 7, down $76.7 billion from this time last year.Trading activity over the next several days will show whether today’s push higher results in short-term profit taking or represents a sustained increase in prices.BTC has ground to cover before it reaches psychologically important $20,000 support when viewing the asset’s moving averages. On a positive note, its current price is approaching its 50-day moving average of $17,895.The 50-day moving average is now within 15% of the 200-day moving average of $20,852. The $20,000 mark for BTC also represents the on-chain realized price for market participants. Recapturing this level would push BTC past a significant technical resistance and key price point.Ether’s price is a bit further on. Its daily price has risen to match its 50-day moving average, and it sits less than 10% away from its 200-day average.",2022/12/13
139,"There has never been a time in the world’s history where environmental sustainability for major businesses has been more critical. The planet is showing signs of dramatic change, and the public is calling for greater accountability from all industries. Often, the blockchain community is portrayed as part of the problem, but this is largely a misrepresentation. This technology may actually assist in the global transition necessary for a sustainable future.The possibilities afforded by sustainable blockchains are massive, and the upsides for the environment are too important to ignore. Of course, there are still challenges to address as is true of any industry, but they are recognized and are being actively worked on. What other industry has had its second-largest operator reduce its energy consumption and emissions by more than 99% in less than 10 years since inception?Stefan Renton is the sustainability lead at Polygon, a blockchain development platform. This opinion piece is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023 outlook.Today, the importance of ecologically sustainable business practices has become a central part of the popular narrative. Prominent companies rush to declare that they are launching various programs to address sustainability, and in many cases they do just what they say. However, it is also common for some of these businesses to hide behind opaque metrics and somewhat more interpretive goals. A lack of transparent oversight or explicit standards exacerbates this. Some companies have been caught fudging the truth about their efforts to be greener in an effort to merely improve their image (also known as “greenwashing”). This serves nobody but company executives and has sown mistrust amongst the broader public.Blockchains are often stigmatized for their burden on the environment. While it is true that Bitcoin itself and similar proof-of-work (PoW) chains have a considerable ecological impact, proof-of-stake (PoS) chains are vastly more energy efficient. For example, the Ethereum network recently upgraded to PoS, which saw Ethereum’s energy usage drop by 99.9%.Moreover, efforts are already underway to address and rectify Ethereum's historical carbon consumption via the newly formed Ethereum Climate Platform (ECP) – a collective of industry luminaries, including Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, ConsenSys, Microsoft, Aave and Polygon, which launched at COP27’s U.N. Climate Change Global Innovation Hub.With new green credentials, blockchain networks can be put to good use by improving tracking and verifiably proving emissions of a given organization or supply chain. Due to their inherent immutability, accountability and transparency, blockchain can track carbon balances and other environmental measures, holding to account companies that proclaim to be sustainable.For example, implementing smart contracts can automate the process of tracking how much carbon is produced at every step of a business's operations. This information could then be reported to various monitoring services and relayed to the public. The verifiable, cryptographically enforced nature of this data will guarantee that it cannot be falsified or obfuscated in any way.Incidentally, that same cryptography will also protect the privacy of the company’s reporting. Thanks to zero-knowledge (ZK) technology, unfalsifiable proofs can be generated that confirm the underlying information without revealing it. In basic terms, a company could provide evidence that it met various energy usage or carbon emission standards without disclosing the underlying data – a current blocker to company transparency when reporting details on emissions producing activities.Another way environmentally friendly blockchains can become a sustainability solution is through the tokenization and digital distribution of digital environmental assets. A recent example is the accelerated development of the carbon credit market, which has attracted the attention of leading organizations across the globe, from the largest registries that provide accreditation including Verra and Gold Standard, to international bodies such as the World Economic Forum.Projects including KlimaDAO and Toucan deliver tokenization of carbon credits, bringing about important discussion on the future of carbon markets and if and how they should be using blockchain technology.There are even blockchain-native iterations focused on solving the scaling problem and the limited supply of current carbon markets such as Nori, whose novel approach recognizes the need for measurable drawdown alongside carbon avoidance. Nori’s future-forward focus, which was not widely recognized in earlier years, has recently secured a partnership and integration with Bayer, which has the potential to deliver immense scale.Even the United Nations is inviting the applications of blockchain in climate action and supporting initiatives driven by the Web3 community.Blockchain's role in helping the environment can go far beyond energy footprints and carbon credits as well. We expect to see an increasing number of sustainability-focused systems launching in 2023, where things like water usage or plastic creation could similarly be tracked and reported. Governments and regulators could create clear standards for what levels of environmental impact are acceptable across various industries and utilize these blockchain systems to monitor them. This would not only benefit the planet itself, but it would also streamline business processes via clear expectations for emissions.Even electrical grids can be managed via blockchains and smart contracts. Where power is routed can be largely automated while also being tracked, and this development stands to make energy use far more equitable. Applications that improve energy demand management can become easier, providing incentives for grid users. Increased access to investment in renewable energy infrastructure is a real possibility enabled by blockchain.The aforementioned ECP is a prime example of the sentiment within Web3 to tackle this monumental challenge. Beyond efforts to mitigate Ethereum's previous carbon footprint, the ECP aims to create a positive impact via investment in scaling carbon-reducing technologies that leverage blockchain.Another important possibility of blockchain and its applications such as DeFi (decentralized finance) is its ability to provide tools to empower communities most affected by climate change and business generated consumption, such as those in the global south. In other applications such as supply chain, it can bring more transparency and provability to equitable distribution of revenue and improved treatment; the next generation of fair trade.Clearly, this technology is nascent, and nobody is saying that blockchain on its own is a panacea for dealing with climate change. Nonetheless, more industries must consider what this technology can offer. Perhaps the most important initial component is accountability for companies claiming to be engaging in sustainable practices. That said, there is so much more that is possible. The world should begin paying attention and get past the notion that blockchain is part of the problem because, in truth, it could form part of the solution.",2022/12/13
140,"Whether it’s Verizon courting government contracts for its 5G upgrade, blockchain startups deploying routers with crypto mining incentives, or Elon Musk making Starlink available to the Ukrainian resistance, broadband and internet of things (IoT) are the new battleground for companies, ideologies and visionaries.This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.While it is still too early to tell whether there will be a singular or divergent solution, the new technological framework for interoperability will have ideology embedded in its code. Crypto and freedom advocates should ensure decentralization as a principle is enshrined, and cooperate to realize and expand on Nikola Tesla’s vision of a decentralized, ubiquitous network.In the late 1800s, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse found themselves in an ideological battle over the future of electricity. Threatened by Tesla and Westinghouse’s widely adopted alternating currents (AC) power system, Edison built out his direct-current (DC) stations, while deploying ruthless public relations campaigns to undermine his rivals’ credibility. As the three men urgently took their products to market and built out supporting infrastructure, corporations on the periphery also competed for market share, including Brush Electricity Company – which installed its arc lighting solutions in key regions including New York City.Tim Kravchunovsky is the Founder and CEO of Chirp. A graduate of Columbia University’s Masters Program, he has over 20 years experience as a network engineer and previously consulted for the World Bank.The AC system won out and became the gold standard underlying all electrification. An important lesson remains for those developing new architecture: The best technology can triumph only when it is also widely adopted.After developing the AC system, Tesla devoted much of his life to revolutionizing wireless electricity. The inventor envisioned infinite energy via a global network of towers that would electrify the world without wires. While investors including J.P. Morgan initially backed Tesla’s venture based on his past success with AC electricity, they later cut funding – a system handing such power over to end users, independent of the large companies who clashed during the “War of the Currents,” was too radical for many to handle at the time, and the technology wasn’t in place yet.Tesla died penniless in New York City, but his vision of ubiquitous energy run across a decentralized wireless system has served as inspiration for scientists, entrepreneurs and world leaders. Founders need to think carefully about the incentive structures that go into building such a system, while resisting centralized parties looking to co-opt its mechanisms under their own infrastructures – the blockchain sector in particular is in a unique position to guard against these attempts.While there is heroism in Elon Musk – an heir to Tesla’s legacy – stepping in to provide Starlink to Ukrainian citizens, there are also warnings that founders should note. Following Starlink’s deployment, Musk walked back his initial support for the cause and threatened to withdraw the program unless the U.S. Defense Department footed the bill. Although Musk also walked back these comments and kept Starlink operational in the region, the reversal revealed an incentive structure based on geopolitics, profit margins, and a billionaire’s impulses – which millions of innocent people suddenly found themselves tethered to. Musk is hardly an outlier when it comes to the murky relationship between centralized vested interests and state power. Telecom companies provide troves of data on millions of users daily to government entities.As the original use case of blockchain technology, Bitcoin allows any individual – no matter their socioeconomic class or country of origin – to take custody of their money. When applied to IoT devices, broadband and telecommunications infrastructure, blockchain technology can bestow more universe digital rights, including the ability to access modern internet and phone services without being surveilled.In the current “builder’s market,” blockchain developers and founders need to pay closer attention to the developments unfolding across telecommunications, broadband and IoT, rather than speculative digital asset bubbles that, unfortunately, defined the space over the past few years. Whether it’s setting up routers to power decentralized wireless networks (following in the tradition of Satoshi Nakamoto sending himself test amounts of bitcoin), or writing interoperable code, the crypto community should apply the principles of decentralization to this next frontier, and work together to ensure the ubiquitous network as envisioned by Tesla can take hold on the same scale as the inventor’s AC gold standard.",2022/12/13
141,"When the decentralized marketplace Storeum debuted its own freshly minted cryptocurrency in July 2019, the STO token soon grabbed traders’ attention: The STO price jumped from a few cents to an all-time high around $35 for a few days in March 2020 before quickly settling back to less than $1.But Storeum has since gone mostly quiet. Its website no longer works and social media accounts are inactive. The token technically still exists, in zombie form, as a contract on the Ethereum blockchain. This year, the STO has taken another step toward oblivion: It has vanished from the pricing site CoinGecko, which lists nearly 13,000 cryptocurrencies that are still considered viable in some form.CoinGecko officials would not confirm when exactly Storeum was deactivated from its website. But a cursory search using the Wayback Machine, which archives websites from prior dates, shows that a Storeum token page was still active as of early 2022. Now, typing Storeum into CoinGecko’s search bar turns up no results.Call it a dead coin.During the crypto bull market of recent years, the number of cryptocurrencies seemed to be ever-increasing, roughly quadrupling from 2019 through early 2022, based on data from the website Statista. Since peaking at 10,397 in February 2022, the number has dropped by about 1,000, the biggest-ever decline in the 13-year-old crypto industry’s volatile history.“It’s relatively simple for someone to create a token,” said Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko. “But these tokens can obviously lose interest extremely quickly.”Just as STO arrived during an earlier crypto bull-market hype cycle, a bevy of tokens appeared last year as bitcoin (BTC) – the oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market value, often viewed as an industry bellwether – shot to a record $69,000.According to CoinGecko, which uses a different methodology from Statista’s, over 8,000 cryptocurrencies were newly listed in 2021, but some 3,300 of them, or roughly 41%, ended up being deactivated and delisted.“During this period, many cryptocurrency projects, tokens and coins with little to no value or any immediate or discernible purpose were launched by various anonymous developers,” Julia Ng, growth marketing at CoinGecko, wrote in a recent analysis. “Few were actually committed to their projects, which resulted in a high rate of failure, and thus their ultimate demise.”Tokens might be removed from the site due to a lack of any discernible trading activity within the last two months, based on CoinGecko's methodology. A coin might also be taken off CoinGecko if it's deemed to be a ""rug pull"" or other scams, or if the project team requests a deactivation.""This might occur when the team disbands, rebrands, shutters the project, or undergo major token overhauls where old tokens become sufficiently illiquid or dead, according to CoinGecko standards,"" Ng wrote.The overall crypto market’s capitalization has shrunk from an all-time high of $3 trillion in November 2021 to about $850 billion now. Bitcoin’s price has fallen 66% over the past year and ether (ETH) is down 71%.Kaiko’s Carey estimated that the number of failed tokens could be “significantly higher in the past two years” because of the explosion in 2017 in the number of ERC-20 tokens – a type that’s easy to mint and runs atop the Ethereum blockchain.“It’s relatively simple for someone to create a token and an associated decentralized exchanges [DEX] liquidity pool,” Carey told CoinDesk. “If no one is providing liquidity, there will be little or no trading volume.”.Rug pullBesides losing buyers’ interests, some token failures could be associated with scams, according to Chainalysis Director of Research Kim Grauer.One of the more common schemes, referred to in the gallows-humor jargon of crypto traders as the “rug pull,” involves “creating a token, funding the liquidity pool, and then removing all the liquidity after an initial rush of people buy the token,” as Carey describes it.As is the case with Storeum, the contract behind the token remains on the blockchain; the data is still there, for posterity, even when the token has gone dormant and is long forgotten. Etherscan, a data explorer for the Ethereum blockchain, shows no transactions have occurred for 231 days.A warning notice on the Etherscan page reads, ""Warning! There are reports that this token used a fake team profile on their website. Please exercise caution when interacting with this token.""At one point, back in 2019, there was chatter on the forum bitcointalk.org that the Storeum project might be a ""scam hitting on all cylinders,"" including speculation that team members were ginned up using artificial intelligence.Chainalysis’s Grauer told CoinDesk that “it is difficult for a token to totally ‘die’ because the code keeps the project running even without buyers.”The existence of dead coins points up a key paradox of the crypto industry, according to Kaiko's Carey: Decentralization, often portrayed as a pillar of virtue, can proves to be little more than an illusion. Just like the fast growth.It's “decentralization, in that the bar to creating tokens has been dramatically lowered in recent years,” Carey said. It's “centralization, in that many of these tokens or projects relied on one or a few individuals to provide liquidity and keep the project alive. Centralized exchanges are well within their right to remove tokens with little or no trading volume, as they won’t contribute to revenue and likely entail some cost to upkeep.”Some tokens might be better off dead.",2022/12/13
142,"Déjà vu. You know that feeling, when you momentarily are not sure of where you are in the timeline and you wonder what you’ve missed. We’re there now.The “blockchain not bitcoin” chorus seems to be re-emerging, taking us back to the 2016-18 heyday of thematic and platform consortia convinced that the benefits of greater efficiency would overcome corporate competition. Bitcoin was an asset with no backing or clear utility, the implied argument seemed to go, whereas blockchain, well that was a technology.Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.Last week, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal titled “Blockchain Is Much More Than Crypto,” in which he reminded us of the potentially far-reaching impact of tokenization and peer-to-peer payments and drilled down on the benefits of risk reduction and settlement speed. Last month, Citi published the results of a survey showing that 92% of participating institutions see value in tokenization while 88% are either exploring distributed ledger use cases or actively participating in blockchain projects. Over the past few days, the Red Cross talked about ongoing work on a blockchain-based aid distribution prototype, and Japanese banking conglomerate Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group announced plans to work on soulbound tokens for digital identity.What’s going on? Is this part of a post-FTX “reset,” a cathartic back-to-basics? Or is something else in play?Both. Yes, we are likely to see more public discussion about distributed ledger efficiencies and less about crypto asset trading and investment. This is a natural reflex after the damage done by layered leverage, flimsy tokenomics and trading fraud, and some high-profile reminders that crypto is not just about greed are more than welcome.Read more: BTC Dominance Is Behaving Weirdly, and That’s Sort of Good | OpinionIt is also an acknowledgement that there is a constant battle for attention, and the “X not Y” model assumes that only one variable is worthy. “Blockchain not bitcoin” emerged in 2018 as an attempt by enterprise projects to capitalize on the market’s performance woes – the new version does the same but swaps in “crypto” to reflect the ecosystem’s spread.So, a large part of this is a cyclical narrative shift. But there’s something else going on as well. This shift comes on top of a longer-term tale of technological evolution and shiny things.The last wave of blockchain hype may not seem to have produced much value. Pilots and proofs of concept involving lettuce, plastics, even (alarmingly) nuclear weapons seemed to deliver no practical utility. Groups working on blockchain use cases for trade finance, healthcare, telecoms, insurance and more have either gone quiet or been wound down.And we have seen some recent high-profile distributed ledger failures. A couple of weeks ago, IBM and Maersk announced the closure of their blockchain-based supply chain joint venture TradeLens. Last month, the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) canceled its much-hyped blockchain project after years of delays and cost overruns. This summer blockchain-based trade finance initiative we.trade, backed by IBM and 12 major European banks, went into liquidation and B3i – a blockchain insurance venture backed by more than 20 insurers and reinsurers – ceased operation.So, the “please, not again” discomfort at the renewed protagonism of “blockchain” potential is understandable and even healthy (inflated expectations of any sort should be kept in check) – but not necessarily correct.Both hype and failure are a natural part of a new technology’s evolution. Remember the dot-com bubble? That wasn’t just about crazy stock valuations – it was as much about the promise of rapid societal change, with business models rewiring their engagement models and individuals flourishing in their new-found creative independence. In the early days of any radical innovation, manifesto and prophecy often get confused, and experimentation – of which failure is an integral part – is the only way to test the bounds of reality.See also: Central Banks and Bitcoin: Closer Than You Think | OpinionYou’re probably wondering where the successes are, and that’s fair because they don’t get much attention. They’re hidden in the persistence of some projects that could have given up ages ago, in new use cases under trial, and in a changing participant profile. Distributed ledger work has been ongoing all along, but given the rapid growth of crypto markets, the “flashiness” of some participants and the gripping drama of the year so far, it has been largely overlooked. Things that move fast get more attention. Enterprise experimentation does not move fast.Some examples: A few years ago, we got excited when a commercial bank successfully issued blockchain-based assets in pilot tests. This week a state-owned bank did the same but for real, and at least one government is almost there, while other governments and banks are testing the process with some intriguing innovations. We also have trials where the main participants are central banks. That is definitely progress.Large traditional asset managers such as KKR, Apollo and Hamilton Lane are issuing blockchain-based tokens representing funds. Not as a proof-of-concept but for real. Just this week we learned that Vanguard Australia is using a distributed ledger for back-office settlement, Starbucks (one of the largest unregulated “banks” in the world) has launched a non-fungible token (NFT) experience in beta for its Rewards users, and Goldman Sachs as well as Germany’s music rights management society have carried out separate distributed ledger tests. Recent initiatives seem to have learned from the failures to date: start small, iterate up the ladder and never overlook human incentives.​There’s also an ideological battle afoot. Many in the crypto industry hate the idea of anything being “permissioned” and accuse all gated experimentation of being “useless” while overlooking regulatory restrictions and client preferences. The assumption seems to be that everyone prefers open networks, permissioned blockchains can never be based on public ones and that the potential to integrate with stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) is irrelevant.Read more: After FTX: Rebuilding Trust in Crypto’s Founding Mission | OpinionThere’s also a strong cohort who thinks we should focus on more innovative applications since traditional markets work fine, in spite of settlement risk, gated access and a dangerous lack of transparency. More efficient and lower cost debt markets, for example, open up opportunities for a much broader demographic than big banks, possibly facilitating the development of sophisticated markets in regions currently underserved. They also make new types of products possible, such as intraday repo, enhancing liquidity in tight markets. Could this be done on traditional databases? Some of it, sure, but would that be future-proofing market evolution? Determining the answer to that is precisely what the experimentation is for.As the dust settles on the FTX fallout, and as the crypto ecosystem takes stock of the damage and starts to heal, we can expect more prominence for enterprise blockchain milestones. This doesn’t at all mean that crypto is losing its sparkle or that asset innovation is done. Last week we saw the emergence of an intriguing new derivative that lets traders bet on the Ethereum staking yield, potentially coalescing market acceptance of a benchmark interest rate. We are also still seeing glimmers of institutional interest in crypto assets as investment. None of that will disappear.But a time in the sun for the less-glamorous side of blockchain evolution will be good for the industry as a whole. We could well still see some ideas that strike us as fanciful, because people are people and creativity should never cease to surprise – who knows, some might even stick. But we can certainly expect more solid experimentation at senior levels.Perhaps even more important: we have to push back on the “X not Y” mentality. The crypto ecosystem is certainly big enough by now for any number of approaches, and this industry grew on the back of permissionless innovation – it’s incongruous to see crypto enthusiasts argue that only one approach is worth any time or attention. For those who care about distributed ledger utility, there’s plenty to get excited about. For those who think there’s greater societal value in trading and saving, markets will continue to evolve and some prices will eventually recover. Many of us may be frustrated by the amount of pixels given to what we personally see as useless ideas – but we should think about what our industry would look like were one reduced group to have the power to decide what is “valid” and what isn’t.Meanwhile, the narrative shift will act as a refreshing reminder that this industry is about much more than profits and portfolio allocations, and that the potential goes way beyond sentiment recovery, regulatory clarity and deeper understanding. “Blockchain and crypto” – there’s plenty of room for both.",2022/12/13
143,"Mending crypto’s reputation on Capitol Hill, tarnished in the wake of crypto exchange FTX’s collapse, will require continuing to engage with U.S. policymakers, according to Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association.Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas Monday, just hours before he was scheduled to testify virtually before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee in Washington, D.C.Smith said on CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin” program on Monday that the industry can “get beyond this current crisis.” What is needed is to work with a “bipartisan set of policymakers who are interested in finding the right regulatory framework” for crypto, not only to protect consumers but to drive innovation.Read more: FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Arrested in the Bahamas“We're going to see a number of bipartisan legislative proposals that are put forth that are going to be very much vetted and debated by multiple committees in Congress, and that we really could see some momentum around getting some legislation done,” Smith said.“What we don’t want them doing is rushing through legislation that hasn’t been vetted or that nobody understands,” Smith said. She said now is the time for lawmakers to ask questions to get to the bottom of what happened at FTX, especially what happened to the customer funds that were lost in the shuffle.Politicians could also think twice about taking donations from primarily crypto-based platforms, according to Smith.Read more: FTX US 'Was Not Independent' of Parent Company, New FTX CEO Will Say in House TestimonyWhether former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s political donations, which amounted to upwards of $73 million, can be clawed back to repay FTX creditors, is unlikely, according to Smith.“Once that money is donated, it’s usually fairly quickly spent,” Smith said, pointing out that in the weeks preceding the election, candidates spend a fairly large quantity of the money they’ve received on sending out mailers and buying airtime.“If it turns out the source of these funds were indeed customer deposits, that’s obviously a massive misuse,” said Smith. “It could be that the genie's out of the bottle and they won’t be able to get it back in.”",2022/12/13
144,"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares hit a record-high discount rate relative to the price of bitcoin (BTC), pushing past 50% for the first time after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reiterated its reasons for denying an application to convert the world’s largest bitcoin fund into an exchange-traded fund.Crypto analysts have said that the discount would likely close if the conversion went through, since the redemption process available for ETF market makers would likely cause the shares to trade back toward the price of the underlying bitcoin.In the past couple hours, the discount has since pulled back slightly to around 48.66%.GBTC, which is managed by Grayscale Investments, was designed as a way to let investors in traditional markets gain exposure to bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency. The fund currently has about $10.7 billion of assets under management, a figure that’s down 65% over the past 12 months thanks largely to this year’s steep decline in crypto prices.The fund is trading at a discount partly because investors, while free to sell GBTC shares in the market, have no way to redeem their holdings in exchange for the bitcoin in the trust. And in the meantime they’re being charged a 2% fee.Negative sentiment surrounding the trust has swelled over the last few weeks as fears surfaced that crypto trading firm Genesis Global Trading, which is owned by Grayscale’s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), might file for bankruptcy.Grayscale says it’s operating as business as usual, but analysts and Twitter posters have suggested that any financial ramifications for DCG might somehow, at some point, affect GBTC. (CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary of DCG.)Pablo Jodar, a crypto analyst at GenTwo, a financial service provider, said that some “investors do not trust the information that Grayscale discloses about the quantity of bitcoin that they’re holding, which contributes to selling pressure.”He also said that a recent spate of deposit withdrawals from the big crypto exchange Binance may have dampened market sentiment. “The market is not trusting intermediaries anymore, and that is why you see investors moving money out of exchanges and financial instruments like GBTC,” he added.Grayscale is currently being sued by hedge fund Fir Tree to obtain details about GBTC in order to investigate potential mismanagement and conflicts of interest. The firm said it wants Grayscale to resume redemptions and cut its 2% fees for the trust.",2022/12/13
145,"FTX was a massive hydra with subsidiaries across the globe. Amid FTX’s failure and entrance into bankruptcy court, one of these subsidiaries appears to be relatively unscathed: FTX Japan. Assuming FTX Japan makes it through, here are some things that other nations can learn from Japan’s experience.J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog. This opinion piece is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023 outlook.FTX Japan is a Japanese-based crypto exchange, formerly known as Liquid, that Bahamas-based FTX purchased in early 2022. Whereas the customers of most FTX entities are in limbo, FTX Japan says that it is close to paying out its customers in full:""We have put together a plan for the resumption of withdrawal service, which has been shared with and approved by the new FTX Trading management team. Development work for this plan has already started and our engineering teams are working to allow FTX Japan users to withdraw their funds.""Japanese customers' cash and crypto will not be bogged down in U.S. bankruptcy proceedings given ""how these assets are held and property interests under Japanese law,"" the exchange says. Meanwhile, the funds of customers of the flagship Bahamas-based exchange, FTX International; Chicago-based FTX US; and FTX Australia remain stuck in bankruptcy limbo.What is it about Japan that may end up allowing Japanese customers of FTX to get their money before anyone else?In brief, careful regulation of crypto exchanges.Spurred by the failure of Mt. Gox in 2014 and the 2017 hacking of Coincheck, both Tokyo-based exchanges, Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) established a broad set of standards for crypto exchanges, or what it defines as Crypto Asset Exchange Service Providers (CAESP). The FSA is also responsible for overseeing banking, securities and exchanges, and insurance sectors.Read more: JP Koning – Let's Stop Regulating Crypto Exchanges Like Western Union Here are six key elements of the FSA's framework for overseeing crypto exchanges:1. Japanese crypto exchanges must segregate customer fiat and crypto from the exchange's own crypto. That is, they can't deposit the exchange's own operating funds into the same account, or wallet, as their customers' funds.A separation of funds reduces the scope for fraud. For example, it would have been easier for FTX executives based in the Bahamas to raid customer funds held at their Japanese subsidiary if those funds were mingled together with FTX's corporate money.2. Going beyond segregation, Japanese exchanges must entrust customers' fiat money balances to a third-party Japanese institution – a trust company or bank trust – where they are managed by a trustee with customers designated as the beneficiaries.By interposing a third-party trustee between FTX Japan and its customers, regulators would have reduced the latitude for FTX insiders to tamper with Japanese customers' cash.Another advantage of a trust requirement is that it adds a layer of protection in the event of bankruptcy. Storing customers' funds with a third-party trustee prevents them from being diverted into a general pot where they can be claimed by an exchange's other competing creditors.Other countries are less stringent. Take the U.S., for instance. U.S. exchanges, including FTX US, operate under state money transmitter law. While some states do require money transmitters to keep customer funds in a trust but many don't, including Florida, Pennsylvania and Georgia. This lack of a trust company layer may be one reason why FTX US customers haven’t heard a peep about getting their money back.FTX Japan claims to be holding 6.03 billion yen worth of customer fiat in trust, or US$44 million.3. A more explicit bankruptcy protection stipulates that customers of Japanese exchanges are entitled to receive payment in priority to general creditors in the case of bankruptcy.Customers are creditors of an exchange. They own an exchange-issued IOU. But a crypto exchange may have other creditors including bond holders, bank lenders, suppliers or other subsidiaries holding inter-company debts. When an exchange goes under, all of these IOU owners are desperate to get some of the remaining crumbs. Putting customers at the very front of the line of creditors is a way to protect them.Compare the luxury of being a Japanese customer of FTX to the plight of Australian customers of FTX. To their horror, they recently found themselves competing with the parent company, FTX Trading, for part of the Australian bankruptcy estate.4. The FSA requires Japanese exchanges to keep at least 95% of customers' crypto in cold wallets. Because cold wallets are not connected to the internet, they are more secure against hacking and internal fraudsters.FTX Japan claims it currently holds 3,194 bitcoin (BTC) in cold wallets, as well as 16,418 in ether (ETH), 64.1 million XRP and a handful of other assets.Many exchanges in unregulated jurisdictions already use cold wallets (although probably not for 95% of their customers' funds). However, smaller exchanges may use other exchanges such as FTX to store customer funds rather than their own cold wallets.Australian exchange Digital Surge, with around 30,000 customers, recently entered into voluntary administration because it kept a significant amount of money on FTX. Huobi lost $13.2 million worth of customer funds that it had stored on FTX, while Crypto.com had $10 million in exposure.Japan’s 95% cold wallet rule helps protect against such losses, as does the following 5% rule:5. For the 5% of customer's crypto that can be kept in a less-secure hot [internet connected] wallet, Japanese exchanges must ""back"" each unit of hot-walleted crypto with exchange-owned crypto held in a segregated cold wallet. So, for example, if an exchange holds 5 BTC of customer funds in a hot wallet, it must hold another 5 BTC of its own personal coins in reserve, for a total of 10 BTC.The FSA refers to these reserves as an exchange's performance-guarantee assets. If there are any inappropriate leakages from hot wallets, the exchange's reserve must be used to make customers whole.6. Lastly, all of these rigid requirements must be verified by an external watchdog.Each Japanese exchange must undergo a yearly ""audit of separate management"" whereby a public accountant examines that each of the above requirements for holding assets are abided by. That is, the auditor verifies that all customer fiat money is being held in trust, that customer funds are segregated from exchange funds, that at least 95% of all crypto is held in a cold wallet and that the exchange is holding an appropriate amount of performance guarantee assets.FTX Japan customers haven't received their funds back yet. So we don't know for sure if they’ll be made whole. But initial indications suggest they will be. If so, credit goes to the six preceding protections afforded to customers of Japanese exchanges.In response to FTX's failure, many jurisdictions are already scrambling to fashion their own regulations for crypto exchanges. They should be watching Japan closely.",2022/12/13
146,"For a few years, I’ve been thinking about why social movements like crypto and bitcoin have so much momentum. I often get emails from proponents of crypto as an anti-monopoly tool, and a lot of smart people I respect believe that it is based on a groundbreaking technology that will sweep the world. I don’t see it that way. I think it’s a social movement based on a dangerous get-rich-quick scam. But there’s a tremendous amount of goodwill involved, and as with GameStop, the underlying driver of the energy in this movement is mass and legitimate disillusionment with liberal institutions who have failed to deliver.Matt Stoller is the author of the BIG newsletter, where a version of this article first appeared in 2021, and former policymaker who focuses on the politics of market power and antitrust. This article is part of ""Crypto 2023.""This weekend, I held a forum for paid subscribers on whether crypto is a useful anti-monopoly tool, and the debate got heated. I learned a lot, and after reading the comments I decided to write an essay, because it seems like there’s a lot of confusion about what crypto is and what it’s for. Dec. 8, for instance, there’s a hearing in the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on the crypto, with lots of talk about innovation along with warnings about risks and regulation. While useful, such traditional financial reform chatter obscures the far more interesting political debate that crypto has brought to the surface of our society about finance, monopoly and the state itself.To explain what is going on, I think it helps to start with a historical analogy, the state that always seems to be a critical ingredient of every financial crisis: Florida. In particular, Florida in the 1920s.In the early 1920s, just after a horrific war and decades of reform that ended in cynicism, a wave of speculation occurred around land in Florida. Thousands of disillusioned Americans in the Northeast sought to get rich quick, like the ""mushroom millionaires"" who had profited in the Great War that killed so many. These speculators used financial instruments and easy money, the equivalent of deregulation, to gamble massively across the economy. The mania became so insane that there was speculation over land lots in the city of Nettie, Florida, a city which later turned out not to exist. Eventually, the bubble popped. First, multiple hurricanes hit the state. The stock market did the rest by crashing in 1929. The result was tears, losses and decades of litigation.See also: The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Culture | OpinionAnd with that, let’s talk crypto. Cryptocurrencies are a social movement based on the belief that markings in a ledger on the internet have intrinsic value. The organizers of these ledgers call these markings bitcoin or dogecoin or offer other names based on the specific ledger. That’s really all a cryptocurrency is. There’s no magic. It’s not money, though it has money-like properties. It’s not anything except a set of markings. Sure, the technology behind the ledgers and how to create more of these markings is kind of neat.But crypto is a movement based on energetic storytellers who spin fables about the utopian future to come. In a lot of ways, cryptocurrencies are like Florida land that no one ever intends to use. It has value in the moment it is traded, but only because there’s a collective belief that it has some intrinsic worth. (There is a wide variety of ""tools"" in the crypto world, like [non-fungible tokens], smart contracts, and global computing systems, but they don’t work, and none of them have any use cases except speculation and money laundering, and even in their idealized form they have no use cases aside from doing stuff you can already do far more easily through existing technology, with a different permissioning model.)That said, the crypto narrative is one that anti-monopolists in general find deeply compelling, since both the anti-monopoly movement and the cryptocurrency movement emerged out of the financial crisis. Elizabeth Warren became a U.S. senator out of the crisis, and eventually pivoted to making the first call to break up big tech. Bitcoin was created on Jan. 3, 2009, a few weeks before Barack Obama was inaugurated as president. Inscribed in the code of Bitcoin is the following phrase, “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” Both crypto and the anti-monopoly movement are reactions to the destruction wrought by neoliberalism.Both financial crisis reformers and Bitcoin proponents believe that the existing financial order is a collusive arrangement between large banks who are supported by government power. Money laundering, tax evasion, criminal activity and fraud are fine as long as you are an insider in this system, and the Federal Reserve and various other government institutions will not only not stop corrupt insiders, but will subsidize and bail them out if necessary. Meanwhile, the rest of us have to live with foreclosures, high interest rates on credit cards and high fees for middlemen in every aspect of the economy.Indeed, it’s hard to see how our social contract is legitimate or fair. No one went to jail for the financial crisis, and the ongoing parade of scandals is nonstop. Just to take a random story that came out last week, several groups published a finding that the $11 trillion private investment industry is a haven for money laundering. We all know there will be no state reaction to fix this.So what is to be done? The traditional populist view is that we should reform our social order through politics, things like mass education, elections, and civic engagement. That’s how Elizabeth Warren sees the world. She wants to strengthen the state so it can restore the social order, one that will tolerate less cheating and will involve the rule of law applied to the powerful.The crypto response is different. The crypto response is to reject the social contract itself as irredeemably corrupt. Their goal is put pressure on the state itself by creating a money-like instrument outside of the public rule-setting capacity of the government. This is framed in the name of consumer choice, as in the state shouldn’t be able to boss you around and tell you what you can do with your money. After all, it’s yours. And anyone who doesn’t buy into this idea is inherently defending a set of collusive bailout-friendly institutions that we sometimes call liberal democracy.But core to having a state, even a democratic one, is the ability to ban things and use coercion to enforce such a ban. Societies and social contracts are built on cooperative mechanisms, but also barriers and enforceable rules. In this framework, the argument of crypto proponents makes no sense. It is basically, ""You can’t tell me not to have access to a money-like mechanism, even if the point of this instrument is to defraud people or engage in ransomware attacks, and even if we know that the ultimate endpoint is a giant collapse when people trapped in a liquidity crisis find out that there is no lender of last resort for Bitcoin or any of the other cryptocurrencies. If you do, that’s tyranny.""In other words, skeptics of cryptocurrencies generally believe that cryptocurrencies are easily manipulated mechanisms to launder money, commit fraud, evade sanctions, empower dictators, engage in heavily leveraged speculation prone to collapse, and ultimately break the state itself. The response to this concern is easy – exactly how is this accusation any different than the existing order? Surely if insiders are allowed to cheat in our regulated banking system, then why should we treat it as legitimate? Why not build our own financial channels? Yeah, maybe it’s bad, but at least we’re not Goldman Sachs or AIG.That’s why I don’t think this movement can be dismissed as merely get-rich-quick mania. There’s goodwill and energy behind this movement, as well as a lot of wealthy cynics and scam artists. But the lack of legitimacy of liberal democracies is real. Increasingly, though, the arguments from cryptocurrency proponents are changing. They are saying they want to be regulated, they are not opposed to the state, they are just into technological innovation, and so forth. That’s why every witness in today’s hearing said they want regulation by the state. I don’t buy it.We’re in new stage, where some very scary people are taking over monetary politics. If crypto boosters sought aggressive reform of the existing financial order, democratizing the Fed, clamping down on big banks, and so forth, and said that until that happens, they will pursue alternative currencies, that would be one thing. But that’s not at all how the politics of crypto works. In Washington, D.C., those who opposed the bailouts and sought to break up the banks – the reformers – are the most skeptical of cryptocurrencies.See also: 'Probably Nothing': Why People Still Hate Crypto | OpinionMeanwhile, the pro-crypto lobby includes men like Pat Toomey, the most pro-bailout and pro-Fed politician in D.C., and is financed by libertarian billionaire Marc Andreessen, a key force behind the rise of Facebook. Led by the leaders of Miami and New York City, a wave of mayors are actively trying to fuse cryptocurrencies to local governments, with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez asserting that these are ""natural resources"" and telling voters they may never have to pay taxes.The amount of utopian [crap] and fake promises on a technology that doesn’t really work as anything but a speculative bubble and money laundering device should be a big red flag. Crypto is a movement based on the theory that the existing nation-state is a system rigged by billionaires, and the right response is to create a different and more corrupt order rigged by different billionaires, money launderers and dictators. It will, of course, all end in tears, ironically when the Fed ends its monetary stimulus, creating bubbles across the economy. That much we know. But how much ruin this movement engenders will depend on whether and how quickly we can restore the legitimacy of our existing governing systems.UPDATE (DEC. 14 – 17:30 UTC): Adds original publication date.",2022/12/13
147,"U.S derivatives regulator Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is suing the founder of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, and trading arm Alameda Research, according to a press release.The suit comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Bankman-Fried for defrauding FTX investors.In its filing, the CFTC said Bankman-Fried had made misleading statements about the health of his companies and the user of customer funds, conduct which had had a “significant price impact” on commodities such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).The document repeats SEC allegations that Bankman-Fried had inappropriately mixed customer assets and blurred the line between Alameda and FTX, with money spent on private jets and “furtively” used to to pay for a Super Bowl ad and sports stadium sponsorship.“The use of customer funds by Alameda was not authorized by FTX customers, and FTX customers were not made aware that their funds were being used by Alameda,” the filing said, adding that this contradicts both best practices for derivatives exchanges and contractual terms of service.In mid-2022, after a crash in crypto markets that saw the likes of Terra and Celsius Network collapse, Bankman-Fried’s companies “portrayed that they remained highly profitable and liquid” in public, despite Alameda’s liability to FTX outstripping the latter’s total lifetime revenue, the document said.But rosy public statements about profits contradicted what Bankman-Fried really knew, the CFTC alleged. In September, Bankman-Fried drafted a never-published document saying Alameda should be shut down permanently because it didn’t make enough money from trading, the filing said.The CFTC was not immediately available for comment.Bloomberg initially reported on news of the lawsuit.Read more: US SEC Charges Sam Bankman-Fried for Defrauding FTX InvestorsUPDATE (Dec 13, 15:10 UTC): Adds details from filing.UPDATE (Dec 13, 16:17 UTC): Removes ""report"" from headline and confirms filing.",2022/12/13
148,"The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.1% in November from the month prior, slowing more than expected from October’s 0.4% pace, in a sign of progress in the Federal Reserve's campaign to bring down soaring inflation.The report pushed up prices for cryptocurrencies, based on the expectation that less-worrisome consumer-price increases might give the Fed more cover to ease up on interest-rate hikes.On an annual basis, the CPI rose 7.1%, the U.S. Labor Department reported Tuesday, below the 7.3% projected by economists in a FactSet survey.Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, which has been relatively steady so far in December, jumped 1.6% in the minutes after the report was released, to about $17,930; it's up 5.2% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second overall, is up 6.9% over 24 hours to $1,335. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) rose 3.8%.Traders have been monitoring the data for signs of whether the Fed’s rate hikes this year are helping to bring down the pace of consumer-price increases, which earlier this year hit a four-decade high. In general, tighter monetary policy puts downward pressure on prices of risky assets, from stocks to cryptocurrencies.The U.S. central bank's monetary-policy setting group, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is meeting this week behind closed doors, with a decision scheduled for Wednesday along with fresh projections by officials on the future path of economic indicators.Core CPI – which excludes food and energy because they tend to be more volatile – rose 0.2% in November, also a slowdown from October, the Labor Department reported.The weaker-than-expected inflation figure comes a day after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that respondents see one-year inflation running at a 5.2% pace.The November CPI release is the final major economic report of 2022 and the last key input the FOMC will see before as this week's meeting kicks off Tuesday. The two-day session is set to conclude on Wednesday with a statement due out at 2 p.m. ET and a fresh ""Summary of Economic Projections"" from top Fed officials, known colloquially as the ""dot plot.""“Tuesday's CPI release along with Wednesday's FOMC meeting will undoubtedly set the tone for financial markets as we head into next year,” analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note, expecting another 50 basis point (0.5 percentage point) rate hike by the Fed on Wednesday.Fed Chair Jerome Powell has previously said that he and his colleagues project the interest rate to peak – probably sometime next year – at a level that's higher than officials' previous telegraphed 4.9%. According to Deutsche Bank, the rate could reach 5.1% before the Fed pauses its campaign.“We expect the dot plot to lean hawkish … reinforcing the committee’s view that policy will need to remain restrictive for longer to guide inflation back to target,” the note said.Analysts at the French bank BNP Paribas see the terminal rate reaching 5.25% by March and holding that level until the end of the year.“Communications will emphasize the likelihood of holding rates at restrictive levels over a longer time horizon – possibly even challenging current market pricing,” they wrote in a note.Powell will speak following the FOMC’s rate hike decision, at 2:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday.UPDATE (Dec. 13, 13:43): Added information about the FOMC meeting Dec. 13-14 and comments from Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas analysts.",2022/12/13

153,"Bitcoin (BTC) rose on Tuesday as investors braced for crucial U.S. data likely to show that the consumer price index (CPI) growth is slowing in response to Federal Reserve's (Fed) aggressive liquidity tightening.The leading cryptocurrency neared $17,500 for the first time since Nov. 1, shrugging off concerns about the health of dominant digital assets exchange Binance.Other cryptocurrencies including ETH, XRP, DOT, MATIC and LTC rose, albeit by less than bitcoin's 24-hour gain of 2.4%, CoinDesk data showed.Bitcoin probably benefited from haven flows stemming from the unease about the health of the dominant cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The cryptocurrency's dominance rate, or the share in the crypto market, rose to 41.4%, the highest since Oct. 29. Historically, traders have piled into bitcoin, lifting its dominance rate during times of stress in the broader market.""Bitcoin's dominance has finally broken above 41%. Its a textbook de-risking market signal,"" Lewis Harland, portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital, said in a daily market note.In addition, the pre-U.S. CPI gain of 0.5% in the futures tied to the S&P 500, the benchmark for risk assets worldwide, likely helped bitcoin.The CPI inflation is forecast to have slowed to an annual pace of 7.3% in November, reaching the lowest since December 2021 and down from October's 7.7% increase, according to a consensus estimate by Refinitiv.Meanwhile, the growth in core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, is expected to have slowed to 6.1% from October's 6.3%.A soft inflation print will likely bolster hopes for a so-called Fed pivot in favor of easing, bringing cheer to risk assets. The Federal Reserve has raised rates by 375 basis points since March to control rampant inflation and the liquidity tightening has ruined risk assets, including bitcoin.Bitcoin traders, however, are playing it safe, and perhaps rightfully so, as a hotter-than-expected CPI could dash the already elevated Fed pivot hopes, triggering broad-based risk aversion and flight to safety.""BTC futures open interest remains flat at $8.25 billion while funding rates skew negative. Traders are taking a predominantly bearish stance,"" Harland said.Open interest refers to the dollar value locked in the number of active futures contracts. The funding rate, charged every eight hours by exchanges, refers to the cost of holding bullish/bearish positions in the perpetual futures market. A negative rate implies bears are paying the bulls to keep their positions open and leverage is skewed on the bearish side.Griffin Ardern, a trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said traders are trying to go long on volatility.Traders typically go long on volatility by purchasing both bullish call and bearish put options. The strategy makes money if the underlying asset either surges or tanks enough to recover more than what was paid to purchase calls and puts.Bitcoin may see heightened price volatility, as too may market-moving events are lined up in the next 72 hours.""The central banks of the four countries – the U.S., Japan, European Union and the U.K. – will announce interest rate decisions this week.

154,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) value proposition is based on the cryptocurrency’s potential usefulness. Its level of future adoption, therefore, is more sensitive to changes in interest rates – or has a longer duration – than gold, Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a research report Monday looking at the benefits of both assets in a diversified portfolio.In the last year came the “end of a decade of easy money” as central banks raised interest rates saw a sharp reduction in speculative positions in gold and bitcoin, the report said. However, gold is roughly unchanged year on year, whereas bitcoin is down 75%, in line with high-growth tech companies.Tight financial conditions are expected to be a drag on bitcoin’s user adoption, the report said, and this makes a repeat of the cryptocurrency’s strong returns of the last decade less likely. Volatility will likely remain elevated until it develops more use cases.“The development of real use cases is also crucial to reducing bitcoin’s volatility, but is by no means guaranteed and may take a long time to play out,” analysts Mikhail Sprogis and Jeffrey Currie wrote.Goldman says such conditions will be a smaller drag on the price of gold as it is a “shorter duration real asset with developed user cases,” adding that the metal “may benefit from structurally higher macro volatility and a need to diversify equity exposure.”The cryptocurrency’s adoption has been boosted by easy financial conditions, the bank said, with some investors more willing to “explore low liquidity, high risk/return options like bitcoin.” With tighter financial conditions expected moving forward, speculative interest in bitcoin is likely to decline.Bitcoin is more levered to financial conditions than gold because the metal has “developed non-investment cases today while bitcoin is still looking for one,” the note said, adding that BTC is a “solution looking for a problem.” The majority of bitcoin supply has not moved for over a year, which suggests that it is being held for investment purposes, the note added.Read more: Goldman: Regulators Should Protect Crypto Investors at the Point of Trust, Not the Blockchain",2022/12/13
155,"The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release the all-important Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for November at 8:30 a.m. ET (13:30 UTC) on Tuesday.If the inflation report comes hot, risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC), may face selling pressure. On the contrary, bitcoin could rally if data shows inflation showing signs of responding to the Federal Reserve's rate hike cycle.In other words, the CPI release could wake up bitcoin from its recent slumber. Trading giant Cumberland recommends an options strategy to profit from the post-data price action.""Sell BTC June calls and hedge with December options,"" Cumberland said in the CPI preview published on dominant crypto options exchange Deribit's market insights blog.The CPI is likely to show the cost of living rose by 7.3% in November on an annual basis, slowing from the 7.7% rise in the previous month. The core inflation, which excludes food and energy, likely rose 6.1% following October's 6.3% increase.To the uninitiated, bullish call options give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Meanwhile, put options give the right to sell.A call buyer compensates the call seller for offering protection against bullish moves by paying a premium when the contract is purchased. The premium received is the call seller's maximum profit, while the maximum loss is unlimited, as, in theory, the market can rise to infinity.Calls gain value when the market rises and bleed when the market drops. Seasoned traders sell higher strike or above-spot price call options when the market is expected to fall or stay flat.In the trade suggested by Cumberland, the June expiry calls will lose premium, making money for the call seller, if the data shows inflation remained elevated in November. A hotter-than-expected print would dash hopes for a Fed pivot in favor of rate cuts, pushing bitcoin lower and eroding the value of calls.""There is reason to believe that a high CPI print on Tuesday could be a tipping point, giving risk assets a strong reason to move back towards the downside and thus generating delta P&L through call selling,"" Cumberland noted.At this point, the obvious question that comes to mind is, what if the CPI misses estimates, bolstering hopes for the Federal Reserve pivot and lifting bitcoin? In that case, wouldn't the June call options gain value, yielding a big loss for the seller?While call options stand to gain value in case of a bitcoin rally, the rate of gain is likely to be tepid.That's because the implied volatility, or the market's forecast of a potential movement in the underlying asset, is expected to drop following Tuesday's CPI and Wednesday's Fed rate decision. A drop in implied volatility, which can be equated with lesser uncertainty, benefits options sellers.""A low CPI should reassert the market’s confidence in inflation coming down, causing a rally in risk assets but bringing vols [implied volatility] down again (generating vega P&L through call selling) as this narrative is already somewhat priced in,"" Cumberland said.Options vega measures the amount of increase or decrease in premium based on a 1% (100 basis points) change in the implied volatility (IV) assumption. A call buyer is long vega and stands to benefit from a rise in implied volatility, which can be equated with the degree of uncertainty. On the contrary, a call seller is short vega and will benefit from a drop in implied volatility.Besides, Cumberland favors buying short-dated options as a hedge against the risk of a potential blowup in volatility in the aftermath of the CPI report.""One can hedge this trade by buying some gamma (short-dated options expiring in December). The low levels of realized volatility have made the weekly straddle prices reasonably cheap compared to historical levels during data week,"" Cumberland noted.""This Friday’s BTC and ETH straddles are priced at 0.0453 and 0.0642, respectively, implying approximate moves of 4.5% and 6.4%,"" Cumberland added, referring to bitcoin and ether.Straddles is an options strategy that involves buying both call and put options when they are cheap relative to historical standards and implied volatility is expected to rise. Buying a straddle is akin to taking a bullish bet on volatility.Readers, however, should note that employing complex options strategies requires active management of position and ample capital supply. That's probably the reason why options market is dominated by institutions and sophisticated traders.",2022/12/13
156,"Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, endured a wave of withdrawals on Monday amid concerns about its proof of reserve report.Net outflows, the difference between the value of assets arriving and leaving the exchange, hit $902 million in the past 24 hours, according to data by blockchain intelligence platform Nansen.Binance’s net outflow has surpassed those of all other centralized exchanges’ in the last 24 hours, and is almost nine times larger than the second largest outflow.The outflow was the highest for Binance since Nov. 13, two days after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection, according to data provided by blockchain data platform Arkham Intelligence.However, the outflow “doesn’t seem notably anomalous,” an Arkham analyst wrote in a Telegram chat, given that there are ostensibly $64 billions of assets on Binance.Withdrawals rose following a string of concerning news reports about Binance, and as investors have become increasingly cautious about their funds on centralized exchanges. The swift collapse of rival exchange FTX, piled on other industry debacles, has prompted other exchanges to prove that they are safeguarding customers’ assets.Binance released a report by auditing firm Mazars last week claiming that its bitcoin (BTC) reserves are overcollateralized.

Jump Trading tweeted on Nov 12. that the firm remained well-capitalized, but didn’t specify losses or capital exposure to FTX.",2022/12/13
157,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin returned to its perch comfortably above $17,000 after dipping earlier in the day amid a news report that Binance was the subject of a U.S. federal probe.Insights: QCP Capital founder Darius Sit told a Tapei Blockchain Week audience that he does not see a recovery before 2024.Bitcoin Continues Its Side WaysBy James RubinA day before they will have a clearer view of the inflation landscape, investors had to reckon with the crypto industry's latest storm clouds: a report that Binance is the subject of a U.S. Justice Department probe, and later Monday, the arrest of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.Bitcoin tumbled below $16,900 at one point before recovering to recently trade at about $17,235, up slightly over the past 24 hours. BTC has spent much of the past two weeks clinging to support above $17,000 and seems likely to continue its tenacious ways for at least another day when the Bureau of Labor Statistics announces November's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.Inflation has shown signs of continuing its downward trend of recent months. On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve will likely drop its latest interest rate increase to 50 basis points (bps) from its current streak of 75 bps hikes, although markets are likely to remain nervously watchful for the time being.""It's a strong risk-off environment, not just in crypto but across every industry and in every country around the world,"" Hany Rashwan, CEO of 21.co, the parent company of crypto exchange-trading fund firm 21 Shares, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""The easiest way of thinking about this is [in] the last 10 years money has been cheaper to acquire, to borrow. As interest rates go up, the value of money becomes higher, so it becomes harder to get, and as a result people spend more carefully.""Yet, Rashwan added that his firm has ""been comforted internally by the plateauing of the bitcoin price within a specific band.""Ether followed a similar pattern to bitcoin, falling earlier in the day before rebounding. The second-largest crypto by market value was recently changing hands at about $1,275, a small gain from Sunday, same time. Most other major cryptos were in the green, with MATIC, the token of layer 2 platform Polygon, and SUSHI, the token of the Sushiswap decentralized exchange, recently rising about 2% and 1%, respectively.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, was recently up 0.23%.U.S. equity indexes closed in an upbeat mood about inflation and the Federal Reserve's expected dovish turn. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively.Meanwhile, according to Reuters, the Justice Department has discussed possible plea deals with Binance's lawyers. Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Seattle began investigating Binance in 2018 after a spate of cases that saw criminals use Binance to transfer illicit funds, according to Reuters. Other prosecutors believe that more evidence needs to be gathered before a criminal case can be filed, causing a split within the Department of Justice.Late Monday, the Bahamian Attorney General's office announced the arrest of Bankman-Fried. ""SBF's arrest followed receipt of formal notification from the United States that it has filed criminal charges against SBF and is likely to request his extradition,"" the office wrote in a release. ""As a result of the notification received and the material provided therewith, it was deemed appropriate for the Attorney General to seek SBF's arrest and hold him in custody pursuant to our nation's Extradition Act.""Genesis Shakeout Will Determine When Crypto Can ReboundBy Sam ReynoldsEverything that could go wrong in crypto has gone wrong in crypto, QCP Capital’s founder and chief investment officer said during a panel at Taipei Blockchain Week. But there are still uses for the asset class, and ""green shoots"" are emerging.“We are in a credit crisis triggered by LUNA and UST,” QCP’s Darius Sit said on stage, referring to the Terra token and algorithmic stablecoin. “This means there are cascading effects on everyone that had credit risks, and there are still some landmines in the space.”Sit said that he sees a great reset and washout caused by the credit crisis, which won't end until investors see whether Digital Currency Group (DCG) and its Genesis Global Trading unit are going to collapse or stay together. (DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk).“If this comes apart, there’s another round of defaults,” he said.Sit pegs a recovery happening around 2024, but macroeconomics will also play a role in this. He noted that the most successful appreciation of digital asset prices came during the COVID-19 pandemic when the U.S. Fed was enlarging its balance sheet. But now the opposite is happening.As far as the use cases and green shoots go, Sit points to the strength of the stablecoin industry, which Sit says has record revenue. There’s also the continued institutional adoption of the crypto options and derivatives market, where QCP is the most active.“The trading teams are all former [foreign exchange] people,” Sit said.If there’s one thing that not even a “dot-com bubble and 2008” can change, it's that everyone is now talking about crypto, Sit said. Meaning, from the cab driver to the banker to the former FX people now trading crypto options and derivatives.

BTC traded as low as $16,882 over the past 24 hours. Ether followed a similar pattern, sliding below $1,250 before regaining ground to trade at about $1,275, up slightly from Sunday, same time.Tron's decentralized algorithmic stablecoin (USDD): The USDD stablecoin, championed by Tron's founder Justin Sun and managed by Tron's decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), fell to slightly below 97 U.S. cents Monday, hitting its lowest level since June 22, according to data source CoinGecko. The decline violated the DAO's 3% price fluctuation threshold for price fluctuations to be considered de-pegs.Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink’s new “staking” program was intended to be broad-based by limiting each wallet to 7,000 LINK tokens. But blockchain data shows one large holder – a “whale,” in crypto parlance – recently was able to get around the limits by creating more than 150 addresses – and then staking the full 7,000 LINK allotment from each of them.

159,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a brief last week defending itself against claims its denial of Grayscale Investment’s application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) was “arbitrary, capricious and discriminatory.Grayscale filed suit against the SEC on June 29 – the same day the SEC rejected its application – and asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the SEC’s order. Grayscale is a sister company of CoinDesk.The suit was followed by a flurry of support from the wider crypto industry and beyond, and five amicus curiae (friend of the court) briefs were filed in the case.But the SEC is sticking to its guns. In the regulator’s first response brief since Grayscale filed suit, the SEC reiterated that its reasons for denying Grayscale’s applications were consistent with its earlier decisions to deny every other spot bitcoin ETF application it had received.Read more: Unpacking the Latest Bitcoin ETF RejectionsIn its lawsuit, Grayscale pointed to the SEC’s approval of several bitcoin futures ETFs to argue that greenlighting one type (futures ETFs) of instrument while rejecting the other (spot, or bitcoin-holding ETFs) was arbitrary, and thus a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).The SEC pushed back in its filing, arguing that “the two products are not the same” and have “fundamental differences in the ability to detect and deter fraud and manipulation,” that “reasonably support treating the two products differently.”Futures ETFs, unlike spot ETFs, are tradable only on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which the SEC pointed out is overseen by federal regulators and performs “extensive surveillance of the trading activity on its market.”The SEC also pointed to prior statements made by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that its permission to trade bitcoin futures “does NOT provide for … value judgements about the underlying spot market.”The SEC has long maintained that its denial of the ETF applications is largely due to the lack of regulatory oversight of the spot market, including surveillance-sharing agreements between a “regulated market of significant size” and a regulated exchange.Without proper oversight, the SEC has argued, spot ETFs could be vulnerable to “fraudulent and manipulative conduct,” including wash trading, price manipulation by “whales,” “malicious control of the bitcoin network,” hacking, insider trading, “manipulative activity involving purported ‘stablecoins’” and fraud at crypto exchanges.Grayscale and would-be spot ETF applicants that came before the SEC have argued the surveillance-sharing agreements the regulator wants aren’t necessary in the case of bitcoin, which they have argued has “novel protections” against fraud.But the SEC disagrees. In the filing last week, it pointed to statements made by Grayscale itself in its registration statement, which warns customers of the “unregulated nature and lack of transparency” surrounding the operations of spot-trading platforms, the risks of hacking and the risk of “fraud and manipulative activity” at bitcoin trading platforms.The SEC also highlighted a statement from the New York Stock Exchange that “fraud and manipulation may exist and that bitcoin trading on any given exchange may be no more uniquely resistant to fraud and manipulation than other commodity markets.”“Given these prior statements and the risks the Commission identified, the Commission concluded that NYSE Arca failed to substantiate its assertions regarding bitcoin’s purportedly novel anti-fraud properties,” the SEC wrote.Grayscale’s reply to the SEC is due on Jan. 13. The SEC’s response to Grayscale is due on Feb. 3.After all briefs have been submitted, the judge will review the SEC’s decision to reject Grayscale’s application and make a determination.As the lawsuit progresses, shares of Grayscale’s largest fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), are trading a record 47% discount to the value of the underlying cryptocurrency.",2022/12/12
160,"Bitcoin (BTC) investors should remain cautious.Historic pricing data for BTC suggests crypto winter will likely worsen next month. So far this month, bitcoin investors have suffered an average 0.08% daily loss, which is far lower than the 0.20% historic average for the month.Spread over 30 trading days, investors would lose 2.4% compared to the 6% gains they notched for bitcoin in past Decembers.Since 2014, bitcoin’s average daily returns have historically been the lowest in January. What’s made these dips less troublesome in past years is that December and February have traditionally been strong months for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Bitcoin has been hovering above $17,000 for the past two weeks, except for a two-day dip last week as investors mulled over the latest fallout from crypto exchange FTX’s collapse, and concerns about inflation.The price invariability and declining trading volume have highlighted investors’ fretfulness. They have been unwilling to forge more strongly into the market until they see firmer signs of macroeconomic improvement. Caution and risk aversion are the flavor du jour and bitcoin’s status as a hedge asset seems antiquated.By contrast, ether has generally performed well in January. Daily returns for the asset have averaged 0.49%, dating to 2017.This difference between ether and bitcoin is counterintuitive, given their normal tightly correlated pricing relationship.Moving from monthly to quarterly data offers a more mixed picture. Since 2014, January’s drag on BTC prices has led to a negative performance during the year’s first three months. However, from 2019 BTC’s performance has been positive in three of the four first quarters during this timeframe. Ether has generated positive average daily returns for every first quarter.Regardless, a weak December ahead of a traditionally weak January doesn’t offer great hopes for bullish bitcoin or ether investors. Whether February offers improvement remains unclear.",2022/12/12
161,"This year has certainly been a series of highs and lows for the crypto industry. After the 2021 bull run, we kicked off 2022 with a correction as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) dropped around 20% and 31%, respectively, in January alone. Macro factors, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes, high inflation, layoffs and generally slowing economic growth have led to much uncertainty. Rough market conditions largely became the standard for much of the year, but that didn’t stop crypto from many incredible technological achievements.Improvements in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector like the protocol Compound’s version (v)3 and the march of the zero-knowledge (ZK) ecosystem continued regardless. Institutional adoption of crypto has also occurred at a rapid pace, with Disney, Starbucks, Adidas and many other household brands quietly embracing blockchain. Large banks have also shown increasing interest in the sector: Fidelity launched a crypto service for investors, BlackRock partnered with Coinbase to bring its institutional clients crypto access and Goldman Sachs is creating a crypto data service.One industry highlight this year was the Ethereum Merge in September, where the blockchain transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, reducing Ethereum’s energy usage by an incredible 99.9%. Secondly, many amazing engineers continued to build through this bear market, and some of the strongest projects came out of it. Another benefit for the industry, though rough in the moment, was the lessons learned from each of the disasters that 2022 brought. Many projects – and even entire categories in crypto – have shown their resiliency in light of these events. If crypto has proven anything through its existence, though, it has proven that it can survive unfavorable times. Because of this, the industry will enter 2023 with a level of strength and durability that 2022 has given it.Paul Veradittakit is a general partner at investment firm Pantera Capital. This story is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 outlook.DeFi will continue to grow while CeFi consolidates: This past year exposed many of the problems of centralized finance (CeFi), while DeFi at large functioned flawlessly. In light of 2022’s many CeFi collapses, I expect the industry to consolidate into highly regulated players such as Coinbase and Bitstamp.In the period following the FTX collapse, DeFi transactions have already spiked, with volumes up 68% (to $97 billion) from October to November. Events like these prove the case for DeFi: governing assets via secure smart contracts enables users to better understand liquidity flows and have more control over their investments.Come 2023, I believe we’ll see more complex and interesting applications of DeFi increase. A few exciting examples are GMX, a decentralized perpetual exchange, and 1inch Pro, a regulatory-compliant platform that connects traditional finance (TradFi) to DeFi. Next year will also likely bring more traction for use cases like self-custody wallets, synthetic assets, and prediction markets.Despite market conditions, the sector’s true strengths lie in its foundational infrastructure that powers transactions in a trustless and efficient way. These properties will greatly accelerate DeFi’s adoption and growth in 2023, especially in light of CeFi’s struggles this year.We will see tremendous ZK adoption and use cases: As the question of privacy comes to the forefront of the crypto industry, zero-knowledge technology has been particularly notable this year. ZK technology essentially uses a prover, a verifier and mathematical algorithms to prove something without revealing underlying information about the proof. Because blockchains are inherently transparent, this application is huge for the industry and allows many more interactions to take place on-chain in a private way. ZK proofs are also extremely lightweight, making on-chain interactions much more scalable and efficient.With projects such as Succinct Labs, Risczero and Espresso Systems emerging, we’ve seen use cases for ZK proofs, VMs and rollups explode. ZK technology has particularly beneficial applications for identity as a crypto vertical. With ZK proofs, users are able to prove their identity on-chain without having to reveal sensitive data. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also noted in a recent piece how huge ZK technology is for solving the on-chain information problem – but that the category is “something that will actually need to be worked on.”ZK technology is also valuable for bridges, which are able to transmit messages and tokens while guaranteeing security and correctness via succinct proofs. There are also exciting applications for TradFi systems like credit scores and taxes.Institutions will increasingly tokenize financial assets: Real-world assets (RWA) are financial primitives that represent a claim on an underlying asset and often produce yield for that asset. The emergence of the category has unlocked huge amounts of liquidity and utility so far, and 2023 will likely bring more assets represented on-chain in an accessible manner.Stablecoins are arguably the most popular application of a RWA in today’s market, with the category constituting three of the top seven tokens by market capitalization. Circle’s USDC and Maker’s DAI have been top-tier stablecoins and have both seen almost no volatility throughout the bear market.On-chain communities have demonstrated demand for RWAs: for example, MakerDAO decided in mid-2022 to invest $500 million worth of DAI into U.S. treasuries and corporate bonds. Goldfinch, a company that provides loans that are collateralized off-chain, currently has an active loan value of ~$100 million. Jia allows business owners to take out blockchain-based loans and generates substantial yields for liquidity providers backed by real-world businesses and assets. I expect 2023 to bring the growth of interesting applications of RWAs, such as flash loans and real estate. In-line with the real world asset trend, I also expect to see a surge of startups focused on bringing TradFi institutions into crypto in a regulatory-compliant way.More companies will emerge to leverage blockchain data: Arguably, rich and open-source data is one of the blockchain’s best features, as it allows for deep analysis of on-chain activity. Leveraging this data in an efficient and responsible way is integral to the expansion of blockchain dapps and their use cases. Data reveals a massive amount about how blockchains are used, emerging trends, user behavior, and on-chain money flows.Blockchain analytics platforms like Nansen will continue to be critical for understanding on-chain analytics through wallet activity. Companies such as nxyz are also tackling blockchain indexing by providing data APIs with no rate limits. Definitive emerged in 2022 to provide user acquisition tooling and insights for both on-chain and off-chain activity. Even with the growth of these companies, blockchain data is still largely untapped and I expect to see significant developments in the sector during 2023. To understand where crypto is going next, we need to get granular with our level of data analysis of the state of the industry as it is right now.The developer tooling stack will continue to grow as blockchain engineers increasingly seek easy and efficient ways to deploy Web3 projects: Developer tooling eliminates many repetitive and tedious parts of the job and encourages more engineers to experiment with creating on-chain protocols. Companies including Alchemy and Tenderly have been particularly critical players in the sector this past year.Despite the bear market, developers have experimented with on-chain applications more than ever. Alchemy recently stated that it saw the number of engineers using its platform soar three times since the start of the year. In September 2022, monthly verified smart contracts were up 2.6 times, year over year. Impressively, 2022 also saw 36% of total smart contracts ever deployed and verified.As a greater number of Web3 developers get involved in the ecosystem, it is critical to provide them with sturdy tooling as they begin to build. Cross-chain tooling is particularly relevant, as it provides composable software that makes launching projects on multiple chains easy. By serving as the backbone for many crypto projects, developer tooling will continue to grow in 2023 as more crypto use cases arise and an increasing number of engineers seek to enter the industry.Non-fungible tokens that provide some kind of value to their holder, such as gaming NFTs and identity NFTs, will expand: Utility NFTs, such as in-game NFTs, identity tokens, and token-gated communities, software, and events will expand in 2023. This year, we’ve seen the sector start to develop technologically and creatively, but the space is nowhere near mainstream adoption. While the digital (pure) art industry is undoubtedly a massive vertical, using NFTs to permit specific privileges has the potential to disrupt many incumbent sectors.We’ve seen some exciting applications and developments of these ideas so far. Proof Collective allows its NFT holders to access future Proof drops (one of which was the popular Moonbirds NFT project) and access to Proof community initiatives, such as in-person events and a private Discord. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also released a formative paper on soulbound tokens (NFTs that hold on-chain identity information), which some projects have already adopted. Gaming transactions also skyrocketed in 2022, at one point composing over half of all blockchain activity. Further, NFTs are starting to be explored in the context of entertainment, specifically for fan engagement.Traditional companies have been exploring adoption of NFTs at an increasingly rapid pace. A few highlights: Tiffany’s released a collection of pendants for CryptoPunk holders, Instagram announced that it will incorporate NFTs into its platform and Nike acquired metaverse fashion company RTFKT. Royal has redefined music revenue streams and ownership by allowing fans to invest directly into songs. In addition, sports players including Cristiano Ronaldo have dropped NFT collections to drive up fan engagement and potentially give access to other future perks.In 2023, I’m excited to see industry disruption and ideas for utility NFTs fleshed out even further. Cryptonative applications, as well as traditional companies, will likely start to experiment more with using NFTs to bring something valuable to their owners.At the end of 2021, I made predictions about the growth of six sectors listed below. Here’s how I score myself on accuracy, with 1 being the least accurate and 5 being the most accurate.Layer 2s and Rollups, both ZK and optimistic, will continue to expand in the coming yearAccuracy: 4Layer 2s have seen incredible growth this year. Though Ethereum underwent the Merge, its gas fees were essentially unchanged, meaning layer 2s are still critical for decreasing the financial barrier to entry to interact on-chain.Layer 2s account for an impressive 30%-40% of Ethereum transactions, and around $250 million flows into layer 2s monthly. Arbitrum and Optimism have been particularly dominant players – both of the networks saw their TVL surpass Solana’s this year. Arbitrum also had an incredible 516% growth in active developer teams since January. Further, cumulative volume traded on all StarkEx platforms has skyrocketed to $775 billion since launch. However, the sector wasn’t completely immune from the effects of the bear: total value locked on layer 2s on Ethereum was down 30%+, from ~$7.3 billion in January to ~$5 billion in late October.Non-Ethereum/Bitcoin chains will become larger players in DeFi, gaming, and moreAccuracy: 4Ethereum’s share of TVL versus alternative layer 1 chains (altchains) has mostly stayed flat between ~50% and ~58% throughout 2022. 2021 saw explosive growth of alternative chains, with Ethereum’s share of TVL dropping ~20%. 2022 has been flatter, with Ethereum retaining around the same share for the year versus competing altchains. Part of this may be due to the Ethereum Merge, where the network switched from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and subsequently made the chain a more attractive option.Though Ethereum maintained its TVL share, many layer 1s did emerge in 2022, promising higher transaction fees and lower gas fees. Two notable examples are Sui and Aptos, both founded by ex-Meta developers (specifically Diem). The projects collectively raised $450 million+ in funding in 2022 and have seen huge amounts of attention and ecosystem growth since launch.I noted last year that Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) platforms have allowed Ethereum dapps to seamlessly launch on other EVM-compatible chains. This technology continues to show its strength, as it essentially eliminates the need to rebuild a dapp from the ground up to ensure that it is compatible with a given layer 1’s tech stack. In 2022, EVM has driven efficiency and interoperability on the development side as well as improved functionality and more seamless liquidity flows for users. Recent data also shows that EVM-compatible chains experienced more activity than non-EVM compatible chains.Composability and Web3 will continue to gain traction as crypto’s use cases growAccuracy: 4Last year, I speculated on the growth of the Web3 sector, which in general is a blanket term which refers to blockchain and crypto-enabled technologies. This prediction was largely accurate as we saw composability/interoperability popularize massively in 2022. Projects like Succinct have done a fantastic job reducing friction by allowing for seamless communication between protocols.Web3 also made huge strides as companies including CreatorDAO, Arpeggi Labs, and Arkive redefined ownership, collaboration mechanisms, and monetization streams. Developers are continually experimenting with fresh use cases for crypto: Ethers.js was downloaded ~948,000 times so far in 2022, a 212% increase since 2021, and web3.js was downloaded ~587,000 times, a 137% increase since 2021. In addition, powerful new revenue streams for creators, financial mechanisms like co-ownership, and identity and social tools were brought to the market in 2022. Companies including Farcaster and Lens Protocol made Web3 social a less complex and more palatable sector by providing users better UI/UX and offering unique, crypto-enabled ways to interact.Expansion of NFTs will be a dominant trend in 2022Accuracy: 2NFTs were definitely all the buzz in 2021, but the sector didn’t fare quite as well in 2022. From the fourth quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022, the total number of NFT sales was down ~46%, from ~14 million to 7 million. Another notable stat reveals that NFT trading volumes have decreased 97% from all-time highs. Additionally, in Sept. 2022, OpenSea saw trade volume decrease 99% since May highs. Many metaverse NFT companies have been struggling as well; for example, digital fashion giant RTFKT saw sales decrease from roughly 14,000 ETH in February to 154 ETH in November.However, the year definitely did see expansion in utility, gaming, and music NFTs, as well as creative new applications for utility NFTs, such as soulbound tokens, token-gated communities and events, and co-ownership mechanisms. In addition, 2022 saw the launch of Sudoswap, a novel and permissionless NFT exchange for trading NFTs via an AMM design. The royalty-free platform saw more than 7,000 transactions in one day at its peak in August, representing over $3 million. Uniswap also recently introduced NFTs on their platform with an aggregator that supports OpenSea, Sudoswap, and X2Y2, among others. Overall, the year brought many creative new takes on how NFTs can be used, despite the category’s sluggish transaction volume.The DAO space will continue to see growth in complexity and use casesAccuracy: 4Both the number of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) – and the number of companies tackling DAO tooling – have grown significantly in 2022. The total number of DAOs skyrocketed from 700 in May of 2021 to more than 6,000 in June of this year, and companies such as Utopia Labs, Coordinape, and Layer3, among others, have made it easy to deploy and manage a DAO.The total market cap of all DAO tokens was roughly $21 billion in Jan. 2022, with the top five DAO tokens constituting $13.2 billion of that number – revealing that value is largely concentrated in only a few quality DAOs. Uniswap, the leading DAO in terms of treasury size, saw its treasury decrease from $2.9 billion at the end of 2021 to $2.3 billion in late Nov. 2022. Most DAO treasuries have followed suit during the bear market, but the sector has shown resilience. Analytics reveal that more than 2,850 DAOs began governance activities from May to Oct. 2022, and in general, more DAOs were created this year than last (on a month-by-month basis). Because incentive structures, use cases, and governance look different for every DAO, the sector is still evolving rapidly and we’re continually seeing fresh takes on what it means to operate as a DAO.Security will be integral for strengthening the DeFi ecosystemAccuracy: 3The Ronin bridge hack in March 2022, where attackers stole $625 million, constituted a higher amount than the roughly $610 million stolen in malicious DeFi exploits in all of 2021. In total, 2022 saw more than $3 billion worth of digital assets stolen, as of Nov. 1. The sheer number of DeFi security companies has certainly increased in 2022, and their tech stacks have improved; however, explosive DeFi growth led to more targeted hacks than ever as the industry expanded.We’ve undoubtedly seen more innovation in the sector as companies such as Quantstamp, CertiK, and OtterSec continually secure the industry via mechanisms such as formal verification, smart contract auditing tooling, and white-hat hacking.However, the spotlight remains on crypto security. In the midst of continued exploits, the FBI cautioned investors of potential platform hacks and asked DeFi platforms to improve security measures. Crypto cannot go totally mainstream unless it becomes secure; 2022 was largely disappointing in terms of hacks, but we did see more companies emerging and strengthening to tackle the issue.Despite some painful hacks and CeFi crashes, the crypto industry as a whole made huge technological strides in 2022. Even through the harsh crypto winter, Web3 has reached an incredible amount of individuals – and the technology is clearly here to stay. Our job as an industry is to make that technology accessible, reliable and safe for users around the world in order to usher in an era of financial transparency, dependability, and autonomy. Web3 continues to redefine how we think about money, ownership (of both physical and digital assets), identity, and community. I’m very excited to see what 2023 brings as we continue to accelerate the adoption of an economic layer to the internet.",2022/12/12
162,"Bitcoin mining firm Argo Blockchain (ARBK) is in advanced negotiations to sell some of its assets and carry out an equipment financing transaction to strengthen its balance sheet and improve its liquidity, the company said in a filing with the London Stock Exchange Monday.The London-based company said it is hopeful it will be able to make these moves outside of a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the U.S., but there is no reassurance it will be able to do so.Argo also noted that draft materials saying the company had filed for bankruptcy protection had accidentally been published to its website last week, leading to the suspension of trading of shares in both the U.K. and U.S. on Friday.The company is now requesting that its listing in the U.K. be restored, and expects that to happen “as soon as practicable.” The miner's shares had already lost about 94% of their value in the past year, underperforming the rest of the industry.As part of the process, the company has hired McDermott Will & Emery LLP as legal advisers, Berkeley Research Group, LLC as financial advisers and Stifel GMP and its affiliate, Miller Buckfire & Co., LLC, as investment bankers.Argo has been trying to raise $25 million to $35 million since late August. In November it became clear it needed the funds to survive. After a deal for $27 million fell through in October, the firm warned it might soon have negative cash flow.Argo has built a mega bitcoin mining facility in West Texas, dubbed Helios. The facility started operations in May with a plan to reach 800 megawatts (MW) of energy consumption and 20 exahash/second (EH/s) of computing power. This would have made Argo one of the world's biggest miners.However, problems quickly emerged, and the firm found costs from the facility outpacing revenue, such that margins narrowed in the following few months. That has been a common issue in the industry as the price of energy has soared and the price of bitcoin has slumped. Argo felt the effect of soaring energy prices particularly hard as it didn't have a fixed-rate power agreement for the Helios facility.Argo also has two smaller facilities in Canada's Quebec province.",2022/12/12

164,"Before 2022, sanctions in crypto sounded somewhat extravagant. While governments around the world have been after this industry for quite a while, it still seemed that cryptocurrencies, by their initial promise of privacy, freedom and censorship resistance, wouldn’t become as politicized as the fiat system.Then 2022 showed how naive those expectations were.This story is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 outlook.“It became very clear that crypto needs to pay attention to sanctions and the consequences of not doing it can be significant,” says Daniel Tannebaum, partner at the Oliver Wyman consulting firm. He believes we will see more enforcement actions related to sanctions, and the mainstream crypto industry will need to keep adjusting to that reality.Crypto felt its first chill of sanctions in 2021 when Virgil Griffith, an Ethereum developer, arrested earlier for speaking at a North Korean blockchain conference, pleaded guilty to helping the rogue regime evade sanctions.The same year, Ethereum projects’ incubator ConsenSys banned Iranian students from a blockchain coding course, and fundraising platform Gitcoin shut down a campaign aimed at Farsi-speaking Ethereum coders.This April, Griffith finally got his verdict: a sentence of 63 months in prison.For the Ethereum community, Griffith’s case was just the beginning. In August, Tornado Cash, an Ethereum-based mixer, was blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The reason: The mixer was used by the Lazarus hacker group linked to North Korea. It was not the first mixer sanctioned this year. But because Tornado Cash is a noncustodial, open-source tool, the incident provoked outrage in the crypto community.Probably the most high-profile crypto sanction case to date, Tornado Cash sanctioning provoked a backlash. The think tank Coin Center and U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase sued OFAC, claiming it had overstepped its authority and deprived Americans of their right for private use of cryptocurrency.OFAC, for its part, believes that neither the open-source nature of the Tornado Cash code, nor the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) managing the protocol’s updates is a reason not to deem it a money-laundering entity that must be sanctioned.“OFAC also kept the door open for DAOs and other decentralized organizations to be viewed as ‘entities’ for sanctions designations and enforcement actions. We are likely to see this come up again if OFAC targets the [decentralized finance] space,” says Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at blockchain intel firm TRM Labs. The sanctions severely hurt the popularity of Tornado Cash, with monthly deposits to it falling by 68%, Redbord added.The crypto community noted that innocent people who used Tornado Cash ended up with their money locked in the sanctioned wallets. In response, OFAC published a guidance, suggesting such users apply for a license to withdraw funds – in other words, deanonymize themselves and their wallets, effectively defeating the whole point of using a mixer.The success of such a procedure, however, is not guaranteed. The users of the sanctioned Russian exchange Chatex, whose money got frozen in the custodian wallet in 2021, applied for their licenses one year ago and are still waiting for resolution.We have yet to see what happens when you ask OFAC to release your crypto from a sanctioned wallet – and what happens afterwards. Tornado Cash is a test of the promise.Tornado Cash was also the first case when a blockchain coder went to jail for his product. Alexey Pertsev, a Tornado Cash developer and one the founders of PepperSec, a company that created the mixer, was arrested in the Netherlands in August and remains in custody as of today.The Dutch public prosecutor voiced the position of law enforcement: Pertsev and his co-founders knew Tornado was used by bad actors, they owned a majority of protocols’ governance tokens and therefore could enforce anti-money-laundering measures but chose not to.While Tornado Cash had a website with user-friendly interface, on which, technically, it was possible to implement know your customer/anti-money-laundering (KYC/AML) features (even considering the absurdity of such an idea for a crypto mixer), its smart contracts code is open source. Users can deploy it without going to a specific website as well as copy it and clone the service, using other, not-yet-sanctioned wallets.This poses the most critical question of the case: Can releasing an open-source code, which can be used by bad actors, be a criminal offense? And, if yes, what does that mean for software developers around the globe? The nature of open-source software means the creator only puts it out there and has no power or responsibility over how people use it.Whether creating the Tornado Cash code will be a part of Pertsev’s final charges (and not just maintaining the website and wallets) and whether the court decides it is a valid accusation will mean a lot for the future of open-source development.“It became clear that the U.S. government is not fond of mixers,” Tannebaum, at Oliver Wyman, said.The war in Ukraine precipitated another wave of U.S. sanctions, this time against Russia, which started the conflict in February, provoking global outrage. As the Western countries have been trying to help out Ukraine and limit Russia’s capacity to wage war, financial sanctions have been applied to both high-profile Russian individuals and the country as a whole.In particular, global payment providers Visa and Mastercard, as well as payment services such as Western Union, stopped sending money to and from Russia, to a significant extent isolating the country’s financial system from the world. In October, the European Union banned crypto exchanges from serving Russian citizens and residents.Immediately, a bunch of services licensed in the EU, such as Blockchain.com, LocalBitcoins, Crypto.com, Dappers Lab and Kraken, informed their Russian users they’re no longer welcome.As with any blanket sanctions, a number of people not involved in anything nefarious got thrown under that bus. Among them, some independent journalists and human rights activists protesting the war, who left Russia when the war started and now are using crypto as a remittance tool of last resort.Now, a number of U.S. crypto businesses are discussing banning Russian nationals from their platforms, even though the U.S. law doesn’t require it at this point, Tannebaum saidThe discussions go this way, Tannebaum explains: “The EU, U.K. and U.S. sanctions on Russia are not perfectly aligned. So to operate across these jurisdictions, do we even want to go through the headache to navigate what is permissible and what is not permissible? We may just ban the clients outright.”Russians I spoke to believe this is unfair; Ukrainians insist that whatever inflicts pain on Russia and Russians is helping to stop the war. Without discussing the gruesome reality that led to this whole situation, it’s worth reminding that Ukrainians themselves have been indiscriminately shadow-banned from U.S. crypto services recently.For several years, U.S.-based exchanges have refused to serve Ukrainians because Ukraine had a sanctioned territory within its borders. That was the Crimea peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, and therefore sanctioned by the West. It is still considered a part of Ukraine by most of the world.So Ukraine, in addition to losing a part of its territory, was effectively penalized for formally owning it! The country’s deputy minister of digital transformation had to write to then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asking him to do something about the anomaly – to no avail for at least another year.If you remember the case of Iranians banned from learning to code Ethereum blockchain by the cautious U.S. companies, you might see the problematic nature of blanket nation-wide crypto sanctions, and even more problematic implementation by crypto entities that would always prefer the public outrage to the ire of an (already not too friendly) regulator.2023 will show if we are about to see more black spaces on the crypto map.The initial thesis that Russians might use crypto en masse to evade sanctions were proved unfounded, says Tannebaum. “The firms that are doing analytics in this space haven’t found evidence of any sort of mass movement out of the traditional banking sector,” he added.However, the sheer proportion of risk and reward from servicing a citizen of a sanctioned nation might encourage exchanges to err on the side of caution.“We are likely to continue to see OFAC engage in enforcement actions against exchanges that do not have the right tools in place to mitigate the risks of sanctions exposure and see OFAC use sanctions offensively as well to deter hacks and the laundering of hacked funds,” TRM Labs’ Redbord believes.There is no sign the sanctions pressure on crypto will get any lower in foreseeable future – on the contrary, the U.S. government, for one, believes crypto services must be proactively banning users when they see “clearly observable red flags” and not to wait for the government agencies to guide their hand.An approach like this might soon make crypto exchanges and other services very similar to banks, effectively excluding “risky” clients and leaving many people frozen out of the financial system.And it looks like the exchanges will be given the strongest incentives to “de-risk” as hard as they can. Only this fall, two U.S. exchanges, Bittrex and Kraken, had to settle with OFAC and pay fines for failing to prevent Iranians from using their exchanges.Major U.S. exchanges have been hiring compliance professionals from the banking sector for a while now, Tannebaum said, so it is no surprise “they’re starting to look at how to quantify risk in a manner consistent with the banking sector’s more mature practices.”Does it mean crypto will be purified of crime and the political untouchables? Chances are, it won’t be. There will always be a market of shadow over-the-counter (OTC) brokers willing to process crime-related and sanctioned crypto. That has been the way the infamous Conti ransomware hacker group used, for example.Those brokers, in turn, still need big exchanges with lots of liquidity to operate, and the exchanges would look the other way only until a certain point. That was the case with SUEX, the sanctioned Russian OTC that used Binance – and was banned.However, AML tools, based on blockchain analytics systems, still allow some space for covering traces, which “will inevitably have some success no matter how sophisticated the controls,” Redbord says.Blacklisting a blockchain address does not automatically mean freezing money on it: the owner of the addresses’ private key still can move funds, sell them peer-to-peer and swap on decentralized marketplaces that do not implement KYC/AML procedures.In February, Canadian authorities blacklisted 34 blockchain addresses with funds raised by the so-called Freedom Convoy truckers. But it didn’t prevent the owners from moving the funds and at least trying to cash them out through exchanges like Crypto.com and Coinbase (the exchanges declined to comment on the fate of the funds).Another example: The arrest of people behind BTC-e, the exchange linked to the Mt. Gox hack, did not prevent someone from spending money from the long-asleep BTC-e wallet in November.In the near future, compliance tools will be getting more sophisticated, making life for sanctioned users harder and harder, Redbord said.So the cat and mouse game will likely only get more intense in the years to come. Only the hunter will get ever hungrier, and the population of prey ever larger and more heterogenous.At the start of the war, Ukraine tried to block another money channel for Russians. The country’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, asked Tether to freeze any transactions related to Russia. Tether did not abide.It’s not clear whether it’s even technically tangible to locate and freeze all funds and transactions belonging to owners of a certain nationality or territory (given the existence of anonymizing tools). But Tether, which maintains tether (USDT) stablecoin smart contracts in a centralized fashion, can blacklist addresses and block funds on them.Another, earlier attempt of protocol-level implementation of sanctions was an initiative of one single American miner Marathon, which announced last May its “OFAC pool” will only mine sanctions-free transactions. The idea was immediately ridiculed by bitcoiners and abandoned in less than a month. However, it doesn’t mean ideas of this sort won’t be entertained – and successfully implemented – in the future.Economist John Paul Koning believes that stablecoins, which by design are mostly centralized, will be the primary target for sanctions in the future.“Going forward, I'd suspect that a greater share of OFAC digital currency designations will explicitly target stablecoins rather than ether or bitcoin, since stablecoins have become the preferred medium of exchange in the crypto ecosystem,” Koning told CoinDesk.Sanctions on the level of protocols would be much more powerful than on the level of service providers. We have yet to see whether the regulators will be pressing developer teams to do it and whether protocol maintainers will abide. That would create a whole new reality where you may not only get banned from an exchange but also find your crypto wallet frozen, just like a bank account.Government authorities would probably love that level of control. And in this case, fully decentralized networks like Bitcoin would seem to regulators like an odd inconvenience once again. There might be a big temptation to go after bitcoin and discourage people from using it.Crypto has to brace for more various and complex battles ahead, with odds not always in its favor. It will require a lot of integrity on the part of the crypto community to preserve at least islands of privacy and personal sovereignty in this future world.",2022/12/12

166,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin was trading steady over $17K as investors awaited the latest Consumer Price Index report and U.S. central bank interest rate decision.Insights: Uniswap's governance proposal to pilot turning on a “fee switch” has received mostly positive reactions, but the community remains cautious.As Big Events Approach, Bitcoin Trades Sideways to Hold Over $17KBy James RubinCrypto markets remained calm over the weekend as investors girded themselves for what will likely be the last significant events on 2022's inflation front, the release of November's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Tuesday and the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision a day later.Bitcoin was recently trading at $17,114, slightly below where it stood 24 hours earlier, and when it started the weekend. With just a couple of glitches, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has held firmly above $17,000 for the past two weeks as the fallout from crypto exchange FTX's implosion and other industry debacles has slowed.In an email to CoinDesk, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, noted that bitcoin has managed to hold the ""17K threshold,"" although the CPI, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate verdict, as well as the U.S. Labor Department's latest jobless claims report on Thursday could affect prices.""With these key events coming up, volatility is expected but the bias remains to the upside and we’d like to see $20K on the top and respect for $16K at the bottom,"" DiPasquale wrote.Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,275, also roughly unmoved from the previous day and when the weekend kicked off. Other major cryptos were trading slightly to the red, with decentralized network Cosmos' ATOM recently falling more than 4% and popular meme coin DOGE off 3.6%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently sank nearly 0.5%.Stocks closed down on Friday following an unexpectedly large rise in November's producer price index (PPI), which calculates monthly wholesale prices. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.4%, higher than Wall Street expectations of 0.2%, suggesting that central bank measures to tame inflation have not been fully effective. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 each dropped 0.7%.The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment offered a counterpoint to the gloom, rising to 59.1, higher than Dow Jones projections of 56.5. The index also signaled more upbeat attitudes about inflation.The CPI fell to 7.7% for October, although the decline was not enough to satisfy monetary hawks fearful about the long-term affects of stubborn inflation. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise the interest rate 50 basis points (bps), a decline from its recent diet of four consecutive rate increases 75 bps, although Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have reiterated their commitment to stem rising prices in recent weeks, and investors have fretted about the possibility of steeper, liquidity-squeezing rate hikes in 2023.BitBull's DiPasquale wrote that investors are already expecting a 50 bps lift, although it ""could rise further upon the [FOMC] announcement.""Uniswap 'Fee Switch' Proposal for Ether Pools Stirs Up Community DebateBy Shaurya MalwaA proposal by crypto exchange Uniswap to test whether reducing trading fees will result in significantly lower volume has attracted a lot of interest from community members and users.The proposal was put forward in July to pilot a ""fee switch"" for a small set of Uniswap protocol pools. The vote was postponed until Dec. 1 to allow more time for people to think about it. On Dec. 2, the vote moved forward and the decision was to go ahead with the test.The switch will not increase fees for users, but will retain a small portion of what is currently paid out to liquidity providers (LP), or users who lock up their tokens on Uniswap in exchange for fee rewards.The fee switch – if enabled considering the current conditions – could potentially mean lesser fee earnings for Uniswap’s liquidity providers and more rewards for holders of Uniswap’s native token UNI, which in turn accrues value for UNI holders.The proposal is a pilot program and is intended to evaluate the impact of turning on the fee switch on trade execution, on a small set of Uniswap pools that utilize USD coin (USDC), dai (DAI) and ether (ETH) over a 120-day period.The experiment will be considered a success, Uniswap’s developers said, if trading execution is not diminished for pools with the fee switch turned on. It is one of the many ongoing examples of community-led decisions that dictate the future growth of protocols like Uniswap.Meanwhile, community reactions remain mostly positive, albeit with caution.Some users in favor of the proposal said not moving ahead with the changes meant “stifling governance/revenue model innovation,” while some expressed concerns  that liquidity providers could pull their funds from the platform.One user called the proposal “a very important moment for Uniswap,” but opined that it was currently the “wrong time” to execute the move.“While we may identify that the fee switch does not or has a minimal negative impact on these metrics for certain pools, taxing LPs certainly cannot help here. I see only downside across the core KPIs,” the user, tagged as “Jack_Longarzo” on Uniswap’s governance forum, said.They added: “The other reason is that this proposal could have very serious and unpredictable negative externalities for the Uniswap community. The Uniswap Foundation’s brief discusses the severe lack of clarity for decentralized finance in the U.S. It is very possible that this proposal could negatively impact community members like Uniswap Labs, the Uniswap Foundation, and even individuals in the community. I don’t think the proposed exploration is justifiable amidst these uncertainties.”3:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:00 UTC) United Kingdom Gross Domestic Product (MoM/Oct)3:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(19:00 UTC) United States Monthly Budget Statement (Nov) 4:25 p.m. HKT/SGT(20:25 UTC) Bank of Canada's Governor Macklem SpeechIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Sam Bankman-Fried Agrees to Testify Before Lawmakers; Bitcoin Regains $17KSam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, tweeted he's ""willing"" to testify at a Dec. 13 House Financial Services Committee hearing.

167,"This week, David Solomon (DJ D-Sol if we’re using stage names), chairman and CEO of investment bank Goldman Sachs, proved he’s stuck in the past with a Wall Street Journal opinion piece he penned titled: “Blockchain Is Much More Than Crypto.” The article was published on the heels of Goldman saying it’s planning to spend “tens of millions” on discounted crypto investments.In the article, Solomon correctly points out that blockchain came in and disrupted heavily regulated industries like banks. Oddly, he goes on from there to claim that the deafening call for regulation means young “blockchain organizations” won’t be able to keep up with regulatory requirements. And that is especially true of cryptocurrencies, but we “shouldn’t miss the forest for the trees” – that is, we should recognize that blockchain can “support responsible innovation across the financial industry” without cryptocurrencies.We’ve heard that one before: “I don’t know about this bitcoin thing, but there’s surely some potential in the underlying blockchain technology!”You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.To defend his position, Solomon shared how Goldman Sachs used a private blockchain to arrange a 100 million euro two-year digital bond for the European Investment Bank that was settled in 60 seconds instead of the usual five days. Praise be to its private blockchain!The takeaway is supposed to be that Goldman will use a private blockchain to reduce settlement times, ultimately lowering costs for all stakeholders.Except.The reason bonds settle in five days is not because of the lack of a blockchain; it’s because of Goldman Sachs and regulation and bureaucratic red tape. Adding a private blockchain isn’t going to rid Goldman Sachs’ bond placement process of Goldman Sachs and regulation and bureaucratic red tape. Especially when that deafening call for regulation is answered.Sure, maybe adding a blockchain is a solution, but really, it’s not for one main reason: Private, permissioned blockchains are worse than useless.Read more: How I Lost My Faith in Private BlockchainsDon’t let anyone trick you; blockchains are not a complicated idea. If you know what a database is (an electronic repository of data), then you basically know what a blockchain is. Databases store data in a place. You or Goldman Sachs can access that data electronically if the database manager allows you access to that data. Otherwise, no data for you or Goldman Sachs.Blockchains are the same thing, but all the data is public and copies of the database are stored in many disparate places. In theory, just about anyone can join and maintain their own copy of the data on a computer they know and trust.If that sounds like a very narrow, minimal-potential use case and potentially slow technology, that’s because it is. There’s no need to allow everyone to have non-permissioned access to every piece of data all the time unless you are trying to get around needing a database manager or some other trusted third party to access that data. Something like digital money could be a good application of this technology.Anything else, you’re better off with a regular database.Really, the takeaway here is that blockchains are yet another round of narrow, minimal-potential-use-case technologies getting shoved into all sorts of broad applications where they simply shouldn’t be shoved. (Cue the conversation about pairing artificial intelligence with our drinking water, or whatever).Shipping company Maersk and tech giant International Business Machines tried to blockchain-ify supply chains and put tomatoes or bananas or whatever on the blockchain through a shipping blockchain called TradeLens (whatever that means). TradeLens failed and shut down two weeks ago after almost five years of trying. It failed because it didn’t reach “the level of commercial viability necessary to continue work and meet the financial expectations as an independent business” because the idea simply isn’t viable.I think the killer app for blockchain is decentralized money. Others think it's decentralized governance. These ideas come to life as unbanked women in Afghanistan seek financial freedom through Bitcoin and as crowdfunding efforts are organized to bid on things like the U.S. Constitution (a sillier example comparatively, sure, but pretty timely). The killer blockchain apps will most probably (and currently do) live on public, permissionless blockchains.All said, I can assure you of one thing: The killer app won’t come from private, permissioned blockchains used to settle bond placements by huge, multinational investment banks.",2022/12/11

Its native token FET’s price jumped from 6 cents at the start of the week to now 11 cents, surging 80% in the five days since Sunday and 36% in the past 24 hours alone at the time of publication. The price jump came after the release of an upgrade to the Fetch.ai wallet with features, including “more easy-to-use messaging,” “fewer server interactions” and “faster load times.”FTX Token (FTT): The native cryptocurrency of the failed FTX crypto exchange surged Friday after the platform's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, came out in support of an exchange revival plan proposed by a crypto influencer Ran Neuner. The FTT token surged as much as 47% to $1.97, its highest level since Nov. 16, after Bankman-Fried's tweet at 08:18 UTC, TradingView data show. The token has since settled back to $1.64.By Glenn Williams Jr.Both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were essentially flat over the last week, with the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value trading .005% and .006% higher than the last recorded price on Dec. 2. Volume for both has been stable, with trading activity falling slightly below their respective 20-day moving averages.BTC appears to be bumping up against potential resistance at current levels. A look at the asset’s Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) indicator indicates high levels of price agreement at current levels, which can lead to static price movement. If BTC breaks above this level, the next high volume node appears at the $20,000 level.ETH’s price, since hitting a short-term bottom on Nov. 22, is showing the early makings of a potential uptrend, with prices up 12% since that day.

171,"Symbiont.io, which almost a decade ago joined the rush of startups trying to bring crypto's underlying blockchain technology into conventional finance, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 1.The New York-based company said its assets and liabilities both ranged between $1 million and $10 million, according to a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for Southern District of New York.Originally named Math Money FX, the company was formed in 2013 to help financial institutions leverage the Bitcoin blockchain to ""reduce risk, save costs, and increase efficiencies,"" according to a company timeline. Early on, it raised money from finance titans including the former CEO of the New York Stock Exchange, and allowed investors to track the cap table (finance jargon for who owns how much of a privately held startup) using the Bitcoin network.Over the years, it continued to win partnerships with large institutions including index-fund giant Vanguard. Just last year, Vanguard and State Street used Symbiont's platform for a foreign exchange forward contract. And just a few months ago, SWIFT, which helps banks move money across borders, said it was using Symbiont's technology.But it apparently fell into distress amid the brutal bear market in crypto that's felled other players, too.",2022/12/09
172,"Prices and ChartsAfter last month’s extreme market plunge as Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange collapsed, some traders might be grateful for a bit of respite – in the form of a sideways-trading market.Both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were essentially flat over the last week, with the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value trading .005% and .006% higher than the last recorded price on Dec. 2. Volume for both has been stable, with trading activity falling slightly below their respective 20-day moving averages.BTC appears to be bumping up against potential resistance at current levels. A look at the asset’s Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) indicator indicates high levels of price agreement at current levels, which can lead to static price movement. If BTC breaks above this level, the next high volume node appears at the $20,000 level.ETH's price, since hitting a short-term bottom on Nov. 22 is showing the early makings of a potential uptrend, with prices up 12% since that day. A distinction between ETH and BTC’s recent price action is that ETH has pushed past a high volume node at $1,200 with the next stop above being at $1,340.Top 90-day performersAmong the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, your 90-day winners are dogecoin (DOGE), litecoin (LTC), XRP and Polygon's MATIC.The laggards are Polkadot's DOT, Avalanche's AVAX, Cardano's ADA and Solana's SOL.Bitcoin and ether are near the middle of the range, ranking 13th and 15th, respectively.Each leader is down versus the U.S. dollar over the last seven days, as are the laggards, except for SOL.CorrelationsBitcoin and ether prices remain tightly correlated at 0.96. Despite the differences between the two assets in supply, consensus mechanism, and utility, their prices continue to move in tandem. Other bitcoin correlations of note include:The week ahead …The upcoming week will have its share of headline-worthy moments.On Dec. 13, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee will hold part 1 of a hearing titled “Investigating the Collapse of FTX.” The embattled former CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, has agreed to testify before the committee, following the threat of a subpoena.The Senate Banking Committee will be holding its own FTX hearing the following day. Whether Bankman-Fried appears remains unclear.The threat of a Senate subpoena may have a similar effect to the House Financial Service Committee’s action.The impact of these events on crypto prices will be long term and connected to legislation arising from each committee’s findings.The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Dec. 14 may have a more immediate effect, although markets seem to have already priced in a 50-basis point rate hike. Investors will likely be eyeing the Fed funds futures rate curve following the meeting.Currently, markets anticipate that rates will reach 5% during the second and third quarters of 2023.",2022/12/09
173,"The Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s layer 2 scaling platform, has a privacy problem. Receiving payments, requesting refunds, and opening and closing payment channels (connections between Lightning nodes) – all raise privacy concerns for users of the payment network.Those concerns have inspired protocol-based solutions like “Basis of Lightning Technology 12” (BOLT 12), a proposed upgrade that not only enhances privacy but also introduces many other useful features. (BOLTs are Lightning draft proposals similar to Bitcoin improvement proposals or BIP.)Independent solutions have also sprung up – notably, lnproxy, an invoice privacy tool (invoices are simply payment requests), and LNURL, a suite of tools for enabling communication between various Lightning applications and services over the web.So what’s a privacy-focused Bitcoiner to do, rely on the fledgling BOLT 12 specification or turn to one of these independent tools?“The best thing about BOLT 12 and the technologies it relies on is that you won't need anything else,” Rusty Russell told CoinDesk. Russell is the lead developer of Core Lightning (CLN) at Bitcoin infrastructure firm, Blockstream. “Lightning nodes will give everyone the privacy they should have by default.”Read more: What Is Bitcoin's Lightning Network?“BOLT 12 adds a ton of functionality to Lightning invoices. It also adds privacy,” said Jack Sweeney, communications manager at LN Capital, creators of Torq – capital management software for Lightning routing nodes – in an interview with CoinDesk. “The real difference between BOLT 12 and something like lnproxy is that BOLT 12 is a protocol-based solution, whereas something like lnproxy is an application layer solution.”BOLT 12 introduces “offers” to the Lightning Network. According to the official BOLT 12 website, “offers are a precursor to an invoice” that enable key functionality such as reusable QR codes, the ability to both send and receive payments and of course, enhanced privacy.Reusable QR codes pave the way for use cases like recurring subscriptions and donations. Send and receive functionality can now be used for Lightning ATMs and private refunds. Finally, new features like route blinding, payer keys and Schnorr signatures will provide an extra layer of privacy.Currently, receiving a Lightning payment means sharing private details with the sender (via an invoice). Route blinding (also called “blinded paths”) makes it possible for the sender to make that same payment to an anonymous recipient by hiding details about the route or path a payment has taken.Lightning payments go from sender to receiver by “hopping” from one channel to the next via a series of Lightning nodes. With route blinding, each node only receives just enough information to pass the payment on to the next node until the payment reaches the recipient.How does a customer request a refund for a product or service they are unhappy with while keeping their identity private? Enter “payer keys.”Offers in BOLT 12 generate payer keys that prove the origin of an invoice without revealing the customer’s identity. Combine that with route blinding and you get enhanced privacy during the refund process.BOLT 12 uses Schnorr signatures, the central component in Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade. Schnorr signatures are a simpler and more efficient alternative to the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures that are still commonly used in Bitcoin today.When a Lightning channel is closed, the closing transaction is currently reflected as a 2-of-2 multisignature (multisig) transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. This metadata, together with additional information and some sophisticated sleuthing, can ultimately expose the personal financial data of private users.Schnorr signatures could potentially solve this issue by making Lightning transactions look like regular single-signature Bitcoin transactions via a signature scheme called MuSig2.Read more: Most Influential 2021: The Developers Who Wrote Bitcoin’s Taproot UpgradeAn anonymous developer has been quietly working on lnproxy, and although the project is new and limited in scope, it’s been gaining a few fans among Bitcoiners.The tool uses a feature called “wrapped” invoices to hide the destination of a Lightning payment or conceal the identity of a sender’s public Lightning node. Essentially, wrapped invoices do for lnproxy, what route blinding and payer keys do for BOLT 12.Wrapped invoices are really just “hold” (or “hodl”) invoices – payment requests that require the recipient to perform some action before cashing the payment.Per the lnproxy website, “lnproxy takes a Bolt 11 invoice and generates a ‘wrapped’ invoice that can be settled if and only if the original invoice is settled [first].”CLN still considers BOLT 12 experimental, and not all Lightning implementations have adopted it.“The thing about the way Lightning spec implementation works is that you need two implementations for it to be considered fully ratified,” Sweeney explains.Based on responses in the BOLT 12 Telegram group, several teams like Lightning wallet firm ACINQ, open-source wallet project Lightning Development Kit (LDK), and open-source Lightning implementation project Lightning Network Daemon (LND) are all working on incorporating the specification, but none has fully adopted it.“It's essentially in beta on Core Lightning,” Sweeney says.Lnproxy also seems to be in some sort of beta stage, based on nascency alone, although nothing on its site explicitly mentions that. Nevertheless, it’s not as fully featured as BOLT 12.“The privacy aspect [of BOLT 12] is just one part of it. The other part of it is the ability to pay with a static invoice,” says Henrik Skogstrom, CEO and founder of LN Capital.An alternative to lnproxy in that regard may be something like LNURL which, although comparable to BOLT 12, requires a complex setup.LNURL is an independent project that’s developed a set of tools for enabling communication (over the web) between various Lightning applications.Much like BOLT 12’s offers, LNURL enables withdrawals and reusable QR codes. LNURL can also replace standard username/password login schemes with a unique wallet-generated Bitcoin key, something not currently available via BOLT 12. Conversely, LNURL lacks standard BOLT 12 enhancements like blinded paths and payer keys.But LNURL’s major drawback is that its users must run their own web server. This means setting up things like dedicated machines, software, domain names and web certificates – a process that requires time, money and expertise.As it stands, both lnproxy and LNURL are effective additions to the Lightning “toolbox.” But the general sentiment seems to indicate little need for either, once BOLT 12 is fully adopted.“The lnproxy server can hide your payment from the payer, but the server still knows who you paid and can definitely reveal it later. LNURL provides a nice way to request invoices but requires that you run a web service, which is not a simple thing to do,” Russell explains. “Lnproxy is a wonderful development and so is LNURL. But these are not substitutes for native Lightning privacy.”",2022/12/09
174,"On Wednesday, Apple Inc. made an announcement that might sound minor: It will now offer end-to-end encryption for most material its users backup on its iCloud storage service.That means only a user with an authorized device will be able to access the contents of their cloud storage, in much the same way only the holder of a private key can control a bitcoin wallet. The new feature will protect photos, notes and other files for users who choose to activate it. Email, calendar and contacts material aren’t included, however, because they need to interact with multiple services. In an announcement that also outlines impressive new high-security messaging features, Apple said encrypted iCloud storage will begin rolling out worldwide in early 2023.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.This change is, in fact, a huge deal.Apple emphasizes the benefits of the new system for defending against hackers. But the privacy implications are arguably more profound. Until now, most materials on iCloud could be accessed by Apple under duress, such as when a search warrant or other court order forced them.Apple has tried to stand up to those demands, for instance in its inconclusive 2015 court battle with the FBI. But the new encrypted storage system will render the legal debate moot: law enforcement and intelligence agencies will not be able to subpoena or otherwise compel Apple to hand over user data, because Apple will simply not have the technological ability to comply.That’s why governments and intelligence agencies have reportedly pressured Apple for years not to release the feature. Apple’s defiance of that pressure is admirable, and has potentially immense benefits for public perception of digital privacy.The most influential digital hardware and software maker on the planet, in short, is making a strong stand for the idea that real digital privacy should be allowed to exist. That Apple regards this as important enough that it is pushing back against the U.S. government puts the lie to one of the most shallow and cowardly arguments against privacy: the idea that “if you haven’t done anything wrong, you shouldn’t care about privacy.” Clearly, Tim Cook disagrees.The move towards end-to-end encryption should in turn help normalize online financial privacy, a major agenda item for the cryptocurrency industry. Crypto privacy has been under mounting attack in cases such as the sanctioning of Tornado Cash.The new Apple systems will benefit crypto more directly in two other ways. First, they will have some direct impact on the security of things like crypto keys and wallets. Whether through negligence or truly bad judgment, some crypto users have been known to store their security keys in iCloud backups. That makes them vulnerable to both hackers and, in one notorious instance, the FBI – but with Apple’s new encryption that risk will be massively reduced.The final notable upside for crypto is that Apple’s new system will introduce a huge new user base to security practices and interface features also widespread in crypto. It will be the first time many users are asked to manage their own personal encryption keys, without a centralized recovery process. It’s not dissimilar to how non-custodial crypto apps and protocols require users to keep track of private keys to “be their own bank.”Apple’s software chief Craig Federighi has called this a major responsibility because, much as with blockchain systems, Apple won’t be able to simply reset and send a new password when a user loses theirs. Though technical details are scarce, this is likely impossible to do without effectively giving Apple a backdoor to user files.See also: 4 Reasons Privacy Coins Haven't Taken Off | OpinionTo mitigate this downside, Apple will also introduce a process known as “social recovery” to a mass audience, according to the Washington Post. An encrypted iCloud user can name another person who will have to participate if they ever lose their encryption key. Social recovery or other “multi-signature” backup schemes are becoming more widespread in crypto as a solution to the risk of key loss.We haven’t gotten a look at the interface or workflow yet, but you can bet Apple has designed something elegant and intuitive. Hundreds of thousands of users are about to be introduced to private key management by the most respected name in computing. From there, crypto is just a hop and a skip away.",2022/12/09

176,"Grayscale Investments, manager of the world’s biggest publicly traded bitcoin fund, said a new decentralized finance (DeFi) fund has started trading on over-the-counter markets.The trading debut for the new fund, under the symbol “DEFG,” comes as the shares of Grayscale’s largest fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), are trading a record 47% discount to the value of the underlying cryptocurrency. Grayscale has said it’s operating business as usual, but speculation about the fund’s future has arisen among traders and on Twitter in recent weeks amid swirling questions about the finances of Grayscale’s parent company, Digital Currency Group, after a halt in crypto lending operations at another subsidiary, Genesis Global Capital. (CoinDesk is also a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.)Similar to Grayscale’s other multi-asset investment vehicles, the DeFi fund is designed to give investors exposure to price movements of a basket of digital assets through a single investment vehicle via the stock market instead of buying the cryptocurrencies directly. DEFG tracks the CoinDesk DeFi Index (DFX), which includes the likes of Aave (AAVE), Uniswap (UNI) and Compound (COMP).The components of the fund will be evaluated on a quarterly basis, according to the press release.This is Grayscale’s 15th digital currency investment product to trade on OTC markets, according to the press release.",2022/12/09
177,"Genesis’ extended withdrawal freeze – the lender has told its creditors it will take weeks rather than days to find a solution – continues to weigh on crypto markets, Bernstein said in a research report Thursday.Parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) owes Genesis about $1.7 billion. Bernstein sees three potential approaches for DCG: It could raise capital, sell non-strategic assets and save digital currency asset manager Grayscale or dissolve the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).The “nuclear option,” and the least preferred choice for DCG, would be a dissolution of GBTC, the report said. DCG could apply for Reg M relief and instead of bitcoin (BTC) being sold in the open market upon dissolution, it could be exchanged for GBTC shares. That would leave holders of GBTC with bitcoin instead, causing the least market impact. It's unclear, however, if GBTC holders want to own the bitcoin itself as many bought the fund to avoid the hassles of cryptocurrency custody, the report added.Raising capital may prove difficult as valuations have dropped significantly in the private market since DCG’s last fundraising in November 2021, the note said. And with $2 billion of loans, the company’s balance sheet position is much worse. Therefore, a potential DCG deal structure would be a “comprehensive strategic financing” using a combination of debt to fund the loans, and fresh equity, the note added.Given the size of loans and illiquid assets, it is likely that the state of the balance sheet would weigh on the residual equity value, Bernstein said. This suggests that any deal would require a more strategic partner to be involved.“The feasible deal might be somewhere between a large minority partner or a buyout-like structure into DCG, led by more strategic partners, possibly financial institutions looking to buy entry into the industry,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.As Grayscale is the “crown jewel” and largest revenue generator in the group, the founders could decide to sell non-core assets including CoinDesk, Luno, Foundry or other venture assets, the note said, but it is not clear if this would bridge the balance sheet gap or happen quickly enough.The best option would be for DCG to work toward a comprehensive, strategic financing of the group, and any deal may involve founder Barry Silbert “giving up a large part of the pie,” the note added.Read more: Bernstein Says Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Is Protected From Fallout at Sibling Company Genesis Global",2022/12/09
178,"Crypto mining firm Hive Blockchain (HIVE) will receive less computing power than forecast from its mining rigs using Intel's (INTC) new chips.The 5,800 new machines, dubbed Hive Buzzminers, will have total computing power of more than 630 petahash/second (PH/s), the Vancouver firm said Friday. In October, it estimated a total of 1 exahash/second (EH/s).Hive did not give a reason for the discrepancy, and had not responded to CoinDesk's request for comment by the time of publication. It's possible it changed the specification of the machines to lower power consumption during a period of high electricity costs. It's also possible it ordered fewer machines than anticipated as the price of bitcoin fell more than 60% this year.Some of the machines have already been installed, with the rest expected by the end of January. The rigs' computing power of about 109 terahahes/second (TH/s) per machine is a little over that of Bitmain's Antminer S19 Pro, released in 2020. Hive didn't divulge the energy efficiency or cost of the rigs, key metrics for miners struggling to keep up with high power costs. The Intel chip is touted as environmentally friendly, indicating that efficiency will be its strong suit.Intel's second-generation Blocksale application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for bitcoin mining rigs was announced in April. It is expected to break the Bitmain and MicroBT duopoly in the bitcoin mining ASIC market. Miners can configure the chip into machines of their own design, such as Hive's. That is a marked difference from the Bitmain machines, which are notoriously closed-source. The flexibility, however, comes with the difficulties of deciding on designs and bringing them to production.Argo Blockchain (ARBK), another one of Intel's early clients, decided to redesign the machines, leading to delays in deployment. The London-based company, which is working with ePIC Blockchain on the rigs, said it wanted to reorient the machines more toward power efficiency, bringing them closer to close to Bitmain's Antminer S19 XP with 134 TH/s at 21.5 joules/terahash. Initially, the machines were designed for computing power, Argo said.Griid Infrastructure and Jack Dorsey's company, Block (formerly Square), have been named as other first customers.Read more: Hive to Buy Intel Mining Chip That Can Raise Hashrate by 95%",2022/12/09

The second-largest crypto in market value rose after Ethereum developers determined that the network’s next hard fork, called “Shanghai,” will have a target release time frame of March 2023. The March fork and a second one in the fall will give developers time to focus on technical issues and alleviate stress for individuals who have their ETH (and any accrued rewards) locked in the Beacon Chain staking smart contract.Crypto news has been anything but straightforward this year, though. Earlier in the day, CoinDesk analyst Omkar Godbole wrote that an ETH bear market was likely to intensify after dipping below pivotal support. ETH fell 17% last month, breaching an ascending trend line connecting June and October lows. Later Thursday, CoinDesk also reported that shares of the world’s largest bitcoin fund, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), hit a record-high discount rate of nearly 50% relative to the price of bitcoin.“The fact that Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust is now trading at nearly 50% discount is just awful for holders of GBTC. It really highlights the vast differences in structure quality between different investment vehicles,” Bradley Duke, co-CEO at ETC Group, said in a note to CoinDesk.Grayscale and CoinDesk are both subsidiaries of Digital Currency Group.Most other major cryptos were recently in the green with MATIC, the token of layer 2 platform Polygon, up about 3.3% and popular meme coin DOGE climbing almost 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, jumped more than 2%.Major equity indexes snapped a five-day losing streak with the tech heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 increasing 1.1% and 0.8%, respectively despite recent macroeconomic uncertainties. On Friday, investors will be eyeing the University of Michigan's widely watched consumer sentiment index, which is expected to tick up a few fractions of a percentage point in its preliminary December reading compared to the previous month.IG North America's Kinahan sees cryptos' recent sideways movement as a victory. ""If you get through the end of the year going sideways, I would look at that more as building momentum,"" he said. ""If you're long right now, you're saying to yourself, 'can we just stay in 1% to 3% of the levels we're at right now because that's building a base that will be longer-term confidence.'""Tokocrypto Token Holders See an UpswingBy Glenn ArdiMedia reports from Indonesia say that Binance is in the process of acquiring Tokocrypto, one of the country’s largest crypto exchanges – except this deal hasn’t yet been completed.It's far from official.

According to CoinGecko data, Tokocrypto’s exchange token, TKO, jumped 97% after the first story was published, and is up 50% over the last week.TKO’s trading volume has jumped from around $3 million pre-story to around $67 million as of Dec. 8.Binance acquiring Tokocrypto would make a lot of sense. Indonesia has 16.3 million crypto users registered with its national know-your-customer system, and a population of 280.7 million. As of August 2020, the country reportedly has more crypto investors than stock market traders.Meanwhile, Tokocrypto has had a rough crypto winter. In the past month, the exchange has laid off 20% of its employees and has begun separating out its business units, such as T-Hub (a crypto lounge community in Bali) and TokoMall (a non-fungible token marketplace), into separate entities and will likely spin them off to raise cash.A Binance acquisition would be the perfect opportunity for the struggling exchange.

181,"Chainlink, a provider of price feeds and other data for blockchains, had its first-ever staking pool draw in 24.27 million tokens worth some $170 million, with community allotment filling up in two days.The new staking effort is designed to help secure the quality of the project’s price feed for the cryptocurrency ether (ETH). Under the system, participants and node operators commit their holdings of Chainlink’s LINK tokens as a form of guarantee, in exchange for 4.75% annualized rewards.The Chainlink team tweeted at 1:51 p.m. ET on Thursday that the staking community pool’s limit of 22.5 million total LINK tokens was “100% filled.” While community allotment has been filled, node operators are still able to stake their LINK tokens because the overall staking pool is capped at 25 million LINK. This leaves node operators with roughly 730,000 remaining LINK tokens to stake.General access for the staking program opened earlier in the day, after an early-access period started Tuesday and had seen rapid uptake. At the current price, the staked tokens are worth about $170 million.Staking is a key part of the project’s “Chainlink Economics 2.0” plan, described on its web site as “a new era of sustainable growth, cryptoeconomic security and deeper value capture.”According to a Chainlink blog post, “Stakers will earn rewards for helping secure the Data Feed, specifically by participating in a decentralized altering system that flags if the Data Feed has not met certain performance requirements regarding uptime.”The overwhelming interest in the new staking effort shows that some cryptocurrency investors and users are still eager to sock money into digital-asset projects, even with the nascent markets mired in crypto winter and bellwether bitcoin (BTC) down 64% year to date.For its part, the LINK price is down 65% so far in 2022, including a 10% decline over the past week.There are roughly 508 million LINK in circulation, so the staked LINK represents about 4.8% of the circulating supply.According to the blog post, the next phase of staking is being planned for release in nine to 12 months, after which participants in the initial phase can unlock their staked tokens and rewards.",2022/12/08
182,"Friday’s Commitment of Traders report will show whether recent increased longs are an aberration or sign of increasing confidence.The most recent COT, which measures weekly trading trends among institutional investors, showed such organizations increasing their exposure to bitcoin last week, even as overall markets remained quiet.The current report, reflecting data for the week ending Nov. 29, came as BTC was trading 1.4% higher than the prior week. Following three successive weeks of reduced BTC exposure on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, institutional investors reversed course, adding 147 new long positions. They currently account for 33% of all long open interest on the CME, and are 80% long as a collective.The degree and direction to which these figures change, if at all, will be a key point in tomorrow’s release.Correlation to macroeconomic factorsAs digital asset prices once again appear highly correlated to macroeconomic factors, increased exposure tomorrow would signal that institutions are relatively confident about next week’s interest rate decision, and comfortable with current BTC entry points.Recent macroeconomic data has not surprised markets. Thursday’s 230,000 initial jobless claims aligned with forecasts. Continuing jobless claims of 1.67 million were higher than expectations for 1.6 million. The irony in the data is that higher-than-average continuing claims are likely viewed more favorably, as markets wade through a “bad news is good news” climate.Projections for a 50-basis point increase in the fed funds rate during next week’s meeting fell only slightly to 75%, from 78% following the data release.Long-term investors appear to be taking advantage of BTC now trading at an opportunistic discount.On-chain metrics reflect little conviction, whether bullish or bearish, specific to short-term price movement. At the moment, signs point to an asset with minimal momentum, trading at a compelling valuation.Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, remains below zero, implying that BTC is undervalued. The metric has declined slightly since Dec 6.Moreover, the three-month rolling, annualized basis for BTC remains below zero, reducing the incentive for traders to place market neutral carry trades.When the basis is positive, traders are inclined to simultaneously buy bitcoin in spot markets and sell BTC in futures markets, pocketing the difference in yields. The same holds true for ether (ETH), whose three-month basis has been below zero since Nov 12.Bitcoin’s chart highlights recent price inelasticity. Since Dec. 1, prices have moved a total of .001%.Ultimately, this market favors investors with long-time horizons and significant comfort in BTC’s valuation.Friday’s COT report will provide insight into the degree to which institutional comfort may be shifting.",2022/12/08
183,"U.S. Senators Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) introduced a bill Thursday that would, if passed, direct the Environmental Protection Agency to study the energy usage and environmental impact of crypto mining.Cautioning that crypto mining threatened U.S. energy goals and local power grids, the lawmakers said the Crypto-Asset Environmental Transparency Act would direct the EPA to produce a report examining the effect miners using more than 5 megawatts of power have on greenhouse gas emissions.In a statement, Markey said the mining firms were ""undermining decades of progress in our fight against climate change by putting profits over the promise of our clean energy future.""""Ensuring crypto mining companies report their greenhouse gas emissions is a necessary step toward holding them accountable and protecting communities across the country that rely on the grid to heat their homes, cook their food, and go about their daily lives,"" the statement read.Markey also warned that utility companies may have to raise prices for other consumers, an issue that's led some communities to try and impose restrictions on mining firms in the past.The bill itself refers to concerns about climate change and its growing ecological impacts, including droughts, wildfires and unusual weather events.""Crypto-asset mining operations ... are often designed to generally increase computing requirements over time, which can lead to increased energy consumption,"" the bill said. ""A crypto-asset network, Bitcoin, consumes more energy annually than countries such as Chile or Bangladesh consume.""Noise and water pollution are two other concerns mentioned in the bill. Furthermore, the bill would impose the same energy recommendations on mining facilities already imposed on data centers.The document recommends the EPA propose rules to cover the crypto mining industry to ensure it is bound by greenhouse gas emission reporting and other similar rules, and assess whether any mining facilities are operating without the requisite permits.Merkley pointed to mining facilities being powered by fossil fuels in a statement, saying this practice ""has an environmental impact on climate chaos equivalent to putting 30 million gas-burning cars on the road! And a lot of that fossil electricity is generated at power plants that have a disproportionate impact on disadvantaged and frontline communities, making bad environmental justice issues worse.""His statement also mentioned mining machines being discarded after they burn out and the ""strain on fragile electric grids.""A number of environmental groups have already expressed their support of the bill, according to a press release.",2022/12/08
184,"Shares of the world’s largest bitcoin fund, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), hit a record-high discount rate of nearly 50% relative to the price of bitcoin (BTC) on Thursday.GBTC is a way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin through a traditional investment vehicle. GBTC was trading at a discount rate of 47.3%, according to data from crypto index provider TradeBlock.“The fact that Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust is now trading at nearly 50% discount is just awful for holders of GBTC. It really highlights the vast differences in structure quality between different investment vehicles,” Bradley Duke, co-CEO at ETC Group, said in a note to CoinDesk.Bearish sentiment surrounding the trust deepened over the last few weeks as fears surfaced that crypto trading firm Genesis Global Trading, which is owned by Grayscale’s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), could file for bankruptcy. DCG is also CoinDesk's parent company.Following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, Genesis Global Trading announced on Nov. 16 that it would halt customer withdrawals from its lending unit, Genesis Global Capital. Amid speculation about a possible filing, Genesis said in a note to clients on Wednesday that a resolution of the lending unit’s withdrawal freeze is likely to be a matter of “weeks” rather than days.One line of speculation on Twitter was that a cascade of liquidity issues at DCG subsidiaries might ultimately lead to the liquidation of GBTC, which could lead to a massive amount of dumping of bitcoin on the open market.There were even some complaints that Grayscale hadn'r transparently proven its GBTC fund reserves.GBTC shares haven't traded at a premium to bitcoin since March 2021. Prior to that date, the trust benefited from strong institutional demand and traded at a double-digit premium to its net asset value.On Tuesday, hedge fund Fir Tree said it is suing Grayscale to obtain details about GBTC in order to investigate potential mismanagement and conflicts of interest. The firm said it wants Grayscale to resume redemptions and cut its 2% fees for the trust.",2022/12/08

Russia’s general prosecutor’s office has already requested his extradition to face criminal charges for fraud, according to the report. He had been on the wanted list since Nov. 12, and was apprehended Nov. 30. Earlier in the month, co-founder Zygmunt Zygmuntovich was also arrested in the UAE, and Russia is pursuing his extradition as well, according to RIA Novosti.Finiko was popular in Russia in 2020-2021, marketing itself as a crypto investment fund. The company, which had been conducting public events and openly advertising itself, operated as a multilevel marketing scheme, offering rewards for bringing in new users and targeting mostly women from 30 to 50 years old, according to the Russian investigative outlet The Bell. It could have gotten away with as much as $95 million of investors’ money, The Bell said.In summer 2021, Finiko froze bitcoin withdrawals on its website, allowing users to withdraw only the fund's native token, FNK, which immediately plunged in price by 97%. According to Crystal Blockchain, at the time of the crash Finiko’s crypto wallets contained 1.8 million USDC, 111.3 million USDT and 888 ETH, as well as 110 million FNK tokens.Sabirov's arrest leaves just one of Finiko's known leaders at large, Marat Sabirov, who is not related to Edvard. Kirill Doronin was arrested in Russia in July, despite obtaining Turkish citizenship under the name Onur Namik.Russian serial crypto entrepreneur Sergey Mendeleev told CoinDesk last year that in January 2021, Finiko has been cashing out massive amounts of crypto, sending Moscow's over-the-counter crypto market into a frenzy.",2022/12/08
186,"Presidio Trading, a quantitative hedge fund focused on trading digital assets, plans to separate its crypto tail risk strategy into a standalone fund, the company said.The decision follows the strategy’s strong performance this year, the firm said. In June, the strategy returned about 560% while the overall fund added 4%. Ether (ETH) fell 44% and bitcoin (BTC) dropped 37% in the same period.“Many current and prospective investors in our multi-strategy fund were interested in learning about our tail risk strategy and if we could provide them with access to the strategy through a standalone vehicle,” said Christoper Kvamme, founder and CEO of Presidio Trading.A tail risk is the chance of an investment loss due to the occurrence of a rare event. Tail risk investment strategies look to reduce overall portfolio risk by outperforming during an unexpected downturn, but do so at the cost of lower returns in a bull market.“It's not just other funds and investors who can benefit from protection against nonlinear drops in cryptocurrency markets. I think this new fund will be valuable to the entire crypto ecosystem; exchanges, payment processors, project endowments, and really anyone with significant exposure to crypto,” Kvamme said.The new fund will make some slight changes to the existing tail risk strategy. While the strategy can post positive returns when markets decline, its current design returns losses when digital assets are performing well. The strategy will be tweaked to provide broader protection, most likely by covering a cryptocurrency index, the firm said.The Dallas, Texas-based firm said it is planning to open the fund to accredited investors in the first quarter of 2023, with a limited capacity of $10 million to start.",2022/12/08
187,"It’s no secret that 2022 has been a difficult year for global markets.The U.S. stock market has fallen over 15% in value, bond markets have fallen over 20% and crypto markets have fallen over 50% from their peak in 2021.Early in 2022, central banks around the world began to raise interest rates in order to slow inflation and decrease the rate of economic expansion. The tightening of monetary and fiscal policies has dramatically decreased investors’ appetite for risk and speculative investment strategies. Many investors have opted to sell or exit speculative asset classes altogether. This macroeconomic pressure has affected traditional asset classes and has put tremendous pressure on emerging asset classes including cryptocurrency.The economic situation leading into 2022 allowed crypto to shine. Record low interest rates, an expanding money supply and a strong economy all set the stage for record growth, both in price and adoption, in the crypto economy.You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.Investor interest in crypto was evident as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) both reached all-time highs, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols grew to record size, the crypto market cap topped $3 trillion, the non-fungible token (NFT) market grew exponentially and venture capital firms invested in many crypto businesses.Centralized finance (CeFi) exchanges saw incredible growth as their services offered attractive yields to investors who were not able to find appealing yields in the traditional financial markets. New crypto projects garnered incredible attention and growth, including the Terra ecosystem, headlined by the algorithmic stable coin UST and sister cryptocurrency LUNA.Investor appetite for risk and speculative asset investments was driven by economic policy that many people believed would continue for years to come. Traders, institutional investors and speculators entered leveraged positions, borrowing money at low rates, which added to the frenzy witnessed in the crypto markets.Watch: DeFi vs CeFi: The Search for YieldAs central banks reversed course, began to decrease market liquidity and raise interest rates, these speculative asset classes started to slow. Because of the increase in interest rates, investors saw opportunities to hold lower-risk investments and earn an attractive yield. As the prices of risk assets began to decrease, the crypto market began to sell off. By the end of the second quarter of 2022, the crypto market cap had fallen over $1 trillion. This severe sell-off was accelerated as leveraged positions began to unwind.New and exciting projects like Terra, began to implode as traders exited the crypto markets. The UST stablecoin de-pegged from the U.S. dollar. Investors lost billions of dollars in the UST blow-up, and the overall market went under even more pressure.CeFi intuitions were overleveraged, having lent significant funds to hedge funds such as Three Arrows Capital, which lost a tremendous amount of capital in the sell-off that followed the Terra failure. Three Arrows Capital, along with many other leveraged hedge funds, defaulted on loans owed to many CeFi companies and these CeFi companies were forced to file for bankruptcy protection. User funds held on CeFi platforms were frozen and retail investors were not able to remove their funds. Companies such as Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, which promised attractive yields to users, failed and users lost their funds.Read more: The Fall of Terra: A Timeline of the Meteoric Rise and Crash of UST and LUNABy the end of the summer, crypto markets were showing signs of stabilizing. The leverage in the ecosystem had apparently been purged from the markets and investor confidence began to return to crypto. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) rose to a summer high level of $1,092 on Sept. 12. Confidence was returning to the markets, driven by FTX, a large exchange and custodian, which had stepped in to rescue large CeFi lender BlockFi from bankruptcy. The seemingly strong FTX, led by founder Sam Bankman-Fried, continued to invest in crypto companies, bailed out many distressed startups and was seen as the strongest company in crypto.Confidence in crypto markets continued into the late fall of 2022, until shocking revelations around FTX and sister company Alameda Research came to light in a November CoinDesk article. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao immediately and publicly expressed concerns around FTX's solvency and ability to sustain its self-issued token, FTT. Traders began to withdraw funds from FTX. The FTT price fell from roughly $26 to $1 in just a few days and FTX paused customer withdrawals.The previously healthy company was discovered to be insolvent, having commingled customer deposits and funds. FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in late November. The previous bailout of BlockFi was reversed and BlockFi was back into bankruptcy court. Crypto markets crashed. The CoinDesk Market Index plummeted to a low of $795 as investors continued their exodus from crypto markets.Read more: The Epic Collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX Exchange: A Crypto Markets TimelineIt is important to note that none of the failures we’ve seen this year have been caused by a failure of the underlying blockchain technology. In fact, technical development has continued in the space, and this year has been a monumental time in the history of many blockchains. Ethereum underwent a successful upgrade in 2022, transitioning from a proof-of-work blockchain to a proof-of-stake blockchain. The tokenomics of Ethereum have also changed significantly, which many people believe will benefit the future of the Ethereum ecosystem.The failures and bankruptcies seen in 2022 have led many people to call for further regulation in crypto. Fraud, theft, along with irresponsible lending and leveraged trading have created a difficult environment for investors, which many believe would not have been possible with proper government oversight and regulation.As we move into 2023, investors should be aware that the current macro environment, lack of regulation and confidence in crypto, and unclear regulatory frameworks will continue to put pressure on crypto. While these issues are significant and will not be easy to overcome, blockchain innovation and progress is continuing to grow and the use cases for the technology are continuing to be adopted. It is important for all investors to review their crypto portfolios, their investment thesis behind crypto allocations, and set a plan for proper crypto investment moving forward.",2022/12/08

190,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin and other cryptos sink some, but not enough to disturb the calm of the past 10 days.Insights: How will the fallout from FTX affect Sino Global's Liquid Value Fund?Bitcoin Dips, Albeit Not by MuchBy James RubinIn soccer World Cup terms, bitcoin's performance the past 10 days would be the equivalent of a 0-0 draw.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization isn't losing or gaining much ground. On Wednesday, BTC was recently trading at about $16,850. That was down more than 1% over the past 24 hours but didn't offer much variance from its perch since late November when bitcoin established support above $17,000.In an interview with CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" TV program, Joe Orsini, vice president of research at digital asset management platform Eaglebrook Advisors, attributed bitcoin's toughness to an at least temporary slowdown in bad news stemming from the collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX and other crypto fiascos this year.""When it comes to the unexpected, no news is good news,"" Orsini said. ""We've had a few things play out since the FTX news, of course, the BlockFi bankruptcy that was relatively priced in knowing they kind of relied on that FTX-Alameda bailout, as well as now you have concerns with some of the lenders. But it's been slow to play out, and there hasn't been that second wave of shock.""Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,230, off 2.8% from Tuesday, same time. Other major cryptos spent much of the day in the red, albeit not by much, as investors continued to gnaw on recent economic indicators suggesting the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy had not taken as big a bite out of inflation as was hoped. SUSHI, the token of the decentralized exchange SushiSwap was recently off more than 8%, while popular meme coin DOGE fell more than 3.5%.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, tumbled 1.59%.Cryptos roughly tracked U.S. equity markets, which were most down, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropping 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively, amid inflationary fears, although stocks performance improved over the steeper drops of the previous two days. Markets received an extra whiff of encouragement on Wednesday when China announced it was dropping its harshest Covid restrictions. China's measures to limit mortalities from the disease have been slowing the economic growth of the world's second largest economy by GDP.Eaglebrook Advisors' Orsini said that additional contagion could unsettle markets. ""The important thing to consider is if the news does come, and if there is real contagion, does it lead to forced selling or liquidations or stronger selling pressure?"" he asked, although he remained upbeat about a crypto rebound.""Price does have a knack for changing sentiment,"" he said. ""When things are on sale, people want them less. We believe in the long run that these event-driven declines have very little meaning to underlying technology. Bitcoin has specific characteristics that it a really attractive form of money, and potentially to take market share away from fiat. And with Etherium, the ability to automate transactions, and the quality of entrepreneurs entering the ecosystem is not changing.""Orsini added: ""Cycles happen, and so we've been in a bear market for about 13 months, and those (bear markets) were where the opportunities lie for long-term investors.""How will FTX Contagion Affect Sino Global Capital?By Sam ReynoldsConnections between Sino Global Capital’s Liquid Value Fund, its first fund for outside investment, and Sam Bankman-Fried as well as Alameda Research, might mean the venture capital fund is mentioned in FTX’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection proceedings, according to a Hong Kong lawyer who specializes in asset tracing.According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Sino Global’s Liquid Value counts Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda as general partners and co-owners of the fund.In a prior comment to The Block, Matthew Graham, Sino Global’s founder, who has been historically closely aligned with SBF and FTX, said that a “substantial” portion of the Liquid Value fund’s $200 million had been committed by FTX and other partners.According to a recent report by the Financial Times, which detailed all of Alameda’s investments, the Bankman-Fried-affiliated fund put $60 million into Sino Global’s Liquid Value Fund. An unknown amount was then contributed by SBF himself.These events will complicate FTX and Alameda’s process in their bankruptcy hearings, says Stephen Chan, a partner at Hong Kong-based law firm Ince.“If they are in a partnership, all partners share in the upside and the downside,” Chan said in an interview with CoinDesk. “The other partners may incur liability for the actions of SBF and Alameda.”A material amount of Alameda’s balance sheet was made up of FTX’s FTT token, as CoinDesk previously reported, which it used for collateral on investments. If Alameda funded part, or all, of its contribution to Sino Global’s Liquid Value fund via FTT, then this pool of assets – and whatever they were invested in – would be a part of what’s available to creditors.If it turns out that SBF and his cohorts were committing fraud and some of SBF’s partners were in knowing receipt of proceeds of fraud, Chan explained, there would be a slightly different route under Hong Kong common law (the fund is domiciled there, and FTX/Alameda had a significant presence in the territory).“If SBF is a general partner, then the partnership may have liability,” Chan said.In instances of fraud, liquidators working on the FTX-Alameda case may look to recipients of proceeds of fraud to see whether civil recovery is possible.But all of this might be challenging, to say the least. Sino Global is heavily invested in Solana and its respective infrastructure.CoinGecko data shows that Solana has suffered a 93% loss during the last year, and in the weeks following FTX’s collapse nearly $700 million in locked-in value has been wiped out from Solana decentralized finance protocols.The token of Orca, a Solana-based decentralized exchange that is one of Sino Global’s leading portfolio companies, reached a high of $20 in October 2021; it is now worth just over 40 cents. Its total value locked went from $1.4 billion at its height to $43.15 million today, according to DeFiLlama.FTX’s FTT token is currently trading at $1.51, up 14% during the last two weeks, but down 95% on the month. Recently, its contract deployer has dumped the entirety of the locked FTT tokens into circulation, effectively flooding the market with what is already a token of questionable value.8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(00:30 UTC) Australia Trade Balance (MoM/Oct)8:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(12:00 UTC) European Central Bank's President Christine Lagarde Speech9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Initial Jobless ClaimsIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Dips Under $17K; Sam Bankman-Fried Hires Attorney Mark Cohen: ReportFormer FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has hired high-profile defense attorney Mark Cohen, the same attorney who represented Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex-trafficking trial, according to Reuters.

BTC has held comfortably above $17,000 for much of the past nine days, despite ongoing investor jitters about contagion linked to the implosion of crypto exchange FTX and macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly signs since late last week that the U.S. Federal Reserve will have to maintain its hawkish course on interest rate hikes through 2023.SushiSwap (SUSHI): The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol is facing a significant deficit in its treasury that threatens its long-term operational viability, according to a governance proposal from project developers. After reviewing expenditures, the project's annual runway requirement was reduced from $9 million to $5 million, but the treasury still provides for only about 18 months of runway, developers said.Axie Infinity (AXS): The native token of the blockchain-based play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, has come out of oblivion this week with a double-digit price rally. Yet, leverage traders appear skeptical if AXS' turnaround from 17-month lows would be longlasting. That's because while open interest, or the dollar value locked in the number of active standard futures and perpetual futures contracts tied to AXS, has increased to a three-month high of $129.70 million, funding rates remain negative, according to data source Coinglass.By Glenn Williams Jr.Absent a black swan or negative contagion event specific to a centralized entity, digital assets still seem very much connected to macroeconomic developments.But, notably, yields for the federal funds rate, U.S. three-month and two-year Treasurys exceed the yield of 10-year Treasurys.This condition, called an inverted yield curve, has predated past economic recessions. If viewed in isolation, an inverted yield curve does not bode well for bitcoin, or copper prices for that matter.

Absent a black swan or negative contagion event specific to a centralized entity, digital assets still seem very much connected to macroeconomic developments.But, notably, yields for the federal funds rate, U.S. three-month and two-year Treasurys exceed the yield of 10-year Treasurys.This condition, called an inverted yield curve, has predated past economic recessions. If viewed in isolation, an inverted yield curve does not bode well for bitcoin, or copper prices for that matter. Increased short-term rates and slower economic growth lead to lower demand and prices for physical and digital assets.Copper’s individual chart is not nearly as gloomy, however.The metal's price has increased close to 3% over the last month on increasing momentum and steady volume. Its 10-day moving average is north of its 100-day moving average as well, which is a bullish sign.On point two, equities may be trading at an unjustified premium at the moment. A CoinDesk article on Tuesday highlighted how equities trading has been unaligned to fundamental data, decoupling from its normal relationship with the two-year Treasury bond yield.Given the decoupling and the price of copper itself, traders may be expecting a reversion to equities, and may place trades accordingly.Unfortunately, bitcoin traders currently don’t have much cause for optimism about short-term price appreciation.Prices have been noticeably range-bound for the last 30 days, and appear poised to continue that way.Sentiment has followed the same pattern, and the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which has occupied extreme fear and fear territory for months, aligns with September figures.For long-term accumulators of bitcoin, however, this is likely their season. The increased connection to macro factors has provided stable (if not sluggish) price activity for the asset, providing investors with additional opportunities for accumulation.",2022/12/07
193,"CORRECTION (Dec. 7, 2022, 18:52 UTC): Corrects headline to say that Lummis views ether as a security.The U.S. senator behind one of the more important pieces of bipartisan crypto legislation in the works said bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that can be considered a commodity because ether is now a security thanks to September's Ethereum Merge.“It’s starting to look more like bitcoin is the only thing that would qualify as a commodity,” said Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), a longtime bitcoin holder and advocate. She told CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin” program on Tuesday that ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could be deemed a security.“It’s a security because of the way [it] moved from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake,” Lummis said about the blockchain’s upgrade earlier this year. The “inability to [unstake tokens] right now makes it susceptible to being [considered] a security.”Read more: US Sen. Gillibrand Says a Last-Ditch Stablecoin Bill May Still Emerge This YearThat could change, of course, she added. It is possible ether will become “sufficiently decentralized that it could later be deemed a commodity.”A member of the Senate Banking Committee, Lummis, with Sen. Kirsten Gillbrand (D-N.Y.), is a sponsor of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, which was introduced in June. If passed the bill would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) the main power to set regulatory standards for crypto. Lummis told CDTV that among the goals of the bill is clearly defining what can be deemed a security or a commodity.Had the bill already been law, Lummis said, the collapse of crypto exchange FTX might've been avoided.“The type of rehypothecation that was going on with FTX and some of the other attributes of FTX which caused it to fail would have been prevented had the Lummis-Gillibrand bill been in effect,” Lummis said.Lummis said the fall of FTX has only underscored a “more emphatic enthusiasm” to reintroduce the Lummis-Gillibrand legislation in the new Congress next month, and to set clear regulatory standards that will help consumers who take part in the digital asset industry.Read more: Key US Senators Introduce Crypto Bill Outlining Sweeping Plan for Future Rules",2022/12/07
194,"It has now been more than a month since the CoinDesk report that unraveled Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange, what could be one of the largest and most egregious criminal frauds in human history. But we’re still getting a steady stream of horrifying revelations, like desiccated victims being excavated from a serial killer’s basement on live TV. On the brighter side, we also have some fresh insight into the severe consequences Bankman-Fried and his co-conspirators are likely to face.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.There has been huge anxiety, particularly among crypto types, about when and whether Bankman-Fried will be brought to justice. Despite clear signs of fraud, he does not seem to have been detained by law enforcement. He remains in the Bahamas, giving interviews intended to obfuscate his actions and distract from the continuing drumbeat of grisly financial discoveries. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is not alone in regarding this as “baffling.”The most paranoid observers (and the seemingly delusional Bankman-Fried himself) might suspect this to be light treatment, the fruit of his years of currying favor with U.S. leaders. But it’s more likely the delay is just part of the slow-grinding legal process, according to an in-depth new legal report from the excellent MacKenzie Sigalos at CNBC. The U.S. Department of Justice has requested an independent probe of the case, and former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti told CNBC that “it sure looks like there’s a chargeable fraud case here.”And Bankman-Fried’s potential punishment is no small potatoes. He could be sentenced to life in prison, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission trial lawyer Braden Perry told CNBC. That’s according to U.S. sentencing guidelines, and taking into account the number of victims and the size of the apparent fraud at FTX and its closely related trading shop Alameda Research. The CNBC report goes into gratifying detail about exactly what books are likely to be thrown at Bankman-Fried, and how hard.See also: What a Securities Lawyer Would Ask FTX's Bankman-Fried | OpinionThe bad news is that those sentencing guidelines are often “bent” to give softer penalties to white-collar criminals. That’s based on the implicit belief, still widespread in the U.S. court system, that things like financial fraud and embezzlement aren’t “real” crimes. Bankman-Fried’s youth, combined with his ongoing scheme to paint himself as an incompetent buffoon, could also elicit undeserved mercy from a court. It will take real and sustained public and political pressure to make sure that Bankman-Fried gets what’s coming to him.Coming to him it most certainly is – and investigators just keep pulling up bodies. Recent days have seen the emergence of at least two leaks that suggest the fraud was even more depraved than previously understood.Data shared with Bitcoin.com appears to show that Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison had a staggering $1.3 billion deficit on her personal FTX margin trading account as of May 2022. Accounting at both FTX and Alameda was clearly considered a detriment to organizational goals (that is, theft). But taken as read, this deficit would be in addition to the mind-bending losses Alameda proper was allowed to rack up on FTX.These deficits, it must be emphasized, point to fraud at FTX more than malfeasance by Caroline Ellison or Alameda (though there was probably plenty of that, too).It has become increasingly clear that part of Bankman-Fried’s strategy is to throw Ellison under the bus by blaming Alameda for losing funds. This was especially clear in an interview published Tuesday with Frank Chaparro at The Block. But the real crime here was not Alameda being terrible at trading – it was FTX’s failure to enforce fair liquidation rules for Alameda, Ellison and perhaps other allies. In effect, exempting them from margin controls enabled their use of FTX customer funds for speculative activities. Bankman-Fried’s backstabbing of Ellison (reportedly a former romantic partner) should be understood above all as an index of just how little character he has, despite his carefully crafted altruistic persona.And the hits just keep on coming: The Financial Times has received a leaked copy of the investment holdings of FTX Ventures, the exchange’s venture capital (VC) unit. One number is paramount here: The total of investment outflows, tallied by the FT, runs to more than $5.4 billion.Here’s the thing: It seems impossible that FTX could have afforded those investments, along with its other vast expenditures, simply from three years of exchange revenue and its own venture capital inflows of $1.8 billion. Maybe some of the FTX Ventures stakes used fake FTX money like FTT, so there’s more work to be done. But very simple arithmetic strongly suggests not only that FTX was dipping into customer funds, but that the people running FTX could not possibly have been ignorant of that fact.Another detail from those FTX Ventures documents may or may not be criminal, but it is unambiguously disgusting. Among the entities receiving money from FTX Ventures were funds that themselves initially invested in FTX, including Sequoia Capital and Skybridge Capital. Why were they investing in their investors? The Skybridge deal in particular had an air of weirdness even back when it was announced in September. The FTX Ventures funding was earmarked for the Anthony Scaramucci-run venture firm to purchase cryptocurrency.This likely meant buying and custodying crypto through FTX, which has been alleged as a condition of other deals by the exchange. So Skybridge (among others) first gave FTX money to attract more users. FTX then effectively sent those user funds back to Skybridge (and others). That left users with fictitious balances, while Skybridge funneled the cash back to FTX. The technical term for this is “shady as hell.”And now we venture into the real basement. What follows is a hypothetical so shocking, so gory, so foul that only the most steel-stomached financial gorehounds should dare entertain it.See also: Let's Talk About the Bankman-Fried New York Times' 'Puff Piece' | OpinionThe Skybridge announcement doesn’t specify what kind of crypto strategies the fund would pursue with the FTX Ventures money. The most horrifying, human-centipede scenario would be that Skybridge, and/or other funds that got tens of millions from FTX, used some of those rehypothecated FTX user funds to buy the exchange token FTT, which was created by FTX.As I’ve detailed, the role of FTT as collateral in various loans was key to the entire house of cards. Re-re-re-hypothecating user funds by getting outside funds to use them to buy or hold FTT would have opened up further leverage for creative accounting. It’s a possibility that’s beyond grim, and beyond Machiavellian.Maybe that’s all we should ask ourselves to stomach for now. Time to go enjoy some light entertainment, something to distract us from the depths of real-world human depravity. I would suggest a light romp like, say, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""",2022/12/07
195,"Crypto assets should be banned if they are too energy intensive, European Central Bank board member Fabio Panetta said in a Wednesday speech that added to the ECB's previous criticism of private digital currencies.Investors have been caught in the “textbook definition of a bubble,” lured by the promise of ever-rising prices, Panetta said in remarks that echo earlier criticism that the unregulated sector is like a “Ponzi scheme” and a “Wild West.”Though the collapse of crypto exchange FTX has revealed flaws in accounting and risk management, Panetta said crypto would likely “continue to attract investors looking to gamble” – a risky activity he wants to keep sealed off from traditional finance.""It is difficult to see a justification for the existence of unbacked crypto assets in the financial landscape,” he added, saying they are too volatile and inefficient to use for regular payments.The FTX debacle will likely send investors toward decentralized exchanges, he said – adding that those exchanges will be harder to regulate and are liable to amplify financial shocks.“Crypto assets deemed to have an excessive ecological footprint should also be banned,” he said, in a likely reference to platforms like Bitcoin that use an energy-intensive mechanism known as ""proof-of-work"" to validate transactions and secure their network.The ECB's skepticism about crypto is nothing new. Two staffers last week said bitcoin (BTC) is on the “road to irrelevance.” Panetta is considering whether the central bank itself should issue a digital currency, and earlier Wednesday, he set out some of the criteria for apps and wallets using the digital euro.Read more: Bitcoin's Last Stand: ECB Staffers Say the Crypto Is on 'Road to Irrelevance'",2022/12/07
196,"Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, released a new report on Wednesday from global financial audit, tax and advisory firm Mazars showing that Binance's customer bitcoin (BTC) reserves are overcollateralized.""At the time of assessment, Mazars observed Binance controlled in-scope assets in excess of 100% of their total platform liabilities,"" Mazars said in an announcement. The exact percentage was 101%.The collapse of centralized crypto exchange FTX because of liquidity issues has rivals rushing to improve the transparency of their financial reserves. The report from Mazars was meant to assure customers that their bitcoin is collateralized, exist on the blockchain and is in Binance’s control.However, the assessment is not an official audit, according to Francine McKenna, lecturer in financial accounting at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ""They did a comparison of balances per public key address from a list they got from management. They did not compare any balances in independent banks or custodians or depositories,"" said McKenna.""This is more worthless than even the Tether or USDC report,"" she added. In September, Friedman LLP, a New York-based accounting firm that provided auditing services for the stablecoin issuer Tether in 2017 was accused of “serial violations of the federal securities laws” and “improper professional conduct,” by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which fined the auditor $1 million. Tether hired BDO Italia to take over its regular attestation reports in August.Mazars took a snapshot of Binance’s total reserves and liabilities on Nov. 22 to perform a collateralization analysis.

200,"CONCORD, New Hampshire — Federal prosecutors say early bitcoin pioneer and Libertarian activist Ian Freeman and a group of his associates helped scammers and other criminals launder more than $10 million using bitcoin through a network of bitcoin vending machines and in-person and virtual cash-for-bitcoin trades from 2016 until their arrests in 2021.Freeman is standing trial in New Hampshire this week to face federal charges related to tax evasion and the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business.Freeman and a group of his associates – who have collectively been dubbed the “Crypto 6” – were arrested in a raid in March 2021.Four of the Crypto 6, including Freeman’s fellow radio host Aria DiMezzo, his former girlfriend Renee Spinella and her husband Andrew Spinella, and Nobody (formerly Richard Paul) have taken plea deals. Though DiMezzo is not set to be sentenced until later this month, the other three defendants escaped with relatively lenient sentences, avoiding jail time. Another, Colleen Fordham, had all charges against her dropped.But Freeman – the host of the ""Free Talk Live"" radio show and a one-time member of the Libertarian migration movement, the Free State Project – has maintained his innocence and has described the charges against him as politically motivated and the trial as a “sham.”Freeman’s trial comes approximately a year and a half after his residence was raided in the middle of the night by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).In March 2021, gun-wielding agents surrounded the Keene, New Hampshire, home, crashing through a first-floor window with an armored car. They seized property from the residence, including $180,000 in cash, coins and bars made of precious metals, and two physical Casascius bitcoins worth a combined 101 bitcoins. Agents also seized several bitcoin kiosks owned by Freeman from restaurants and other local businesses.During their opening statements on Tuesday, prosecutors told the New Hampshire jury that Freeman was the ringleader of the illegal crypto selling business.They said that Freeman began by installing several bitcoin kiosks (which have been described as distinct from bitcoin ATMs due to their local wallets) throughout the state of New Hampshire, and then eventually branched out into advertising for in-person and virtual cash-for-bitcoins trades on websites like localbitcoins.com.Freeman didn’t ask a lot of questions of his customers, prosecutors told the jury, but charged his customers a premium (usually between 10% and 15%) for their privacy.Assistant U.S. Attorney Georgiana MacDonald described Freeman’s “golden rule” of telling his customers that “what you do with your bitcoin is your business” and not to give him more information.MacDonald said that Freeman’s bank accounts were often shut down, which is why he enlisted the help of his friends and colleagues, whom he asked to help him by opening bank accounts – sometimes in their own names, but also by forming religious entities.Prosecutors say that DiMezzo (who described herself as a “transsexual Satanist anarchist” while running as the Republican candidate for Cheshire County sheriff in 2020) opened an account for the Reformed Satanic Church, and Nobody opened another for the so-called Church of the Invisible Hand.MacDonald described the churches (of which a multitude are involved in Freeman’s operation, including the Shire Free Church, the entity that owns ""Free Talk Radio"") as “little more than letterhead” for Freeman’s operation.Customers of Freeman’s virtual cash-for-bitcoins business (whom prosecutors say include scammers preying on the elderly with romance scams or “Nigerian prince” scams) were allegedly directed to send money to one of the bank accounts associated with the Crypto 6, using descriptions like “purchase of rare coins” or to avoid flagging the attention of the banks.When Freeman’s lawyer, Mark Sisti, addressed the jury during his opening statements on Tuesday, he told them that what they’d heard from MacDonald was “absolute nonsense” and accused the government of intentionally leaving out details that did not benefit their case against Freeman.“Just because it's the federal government, and just because it is an Assistant U.S. Attorney saying it, doesn’t make it true,” Sisti told the jury. “Just because it’s an FBI investigation doesn’t make it credible.”Sisti described Freeman as a gentle, non-violent man who helped victims of scams rather than perpetrating them, and had even helped with crypto-related investigations. The churches implicated in his operation were real institutions, Sisti argued, which had done things like set up an orphanage in Uganda and helped local businesses in New Hampshire set up bitcoin payment systems.Freeman, Sisti said, operated his business in the open and kept records of his transactions (including pictures of his customers’ drivers licenses) on his computer.“Why would you hold onto [licenses and pictures] if you’re scamming? You’d ditch that junk as quick as you could,” Sisti told the jury. “It makes no sense.”Sisti said Freeman often declined to do business with suspicious customers, including an undercover agent who claimed to be a heroin dealer. Sisti said the agent put $20,000 in one of Freeman’s bitcoin kiosks even after Freeman told him he wouldn’t do business with him in person as he’d requested.“[MacDonald] told you he said no before this clown went to a vending machine – without Freeman’s permission by the way – and dumped $20,000,” Sisti said. “What’s he supposed to do, put an armed guard in front of his vending machine?”Sisti also pushed back against MacDonald’s assertions that Freeman ignored “red flags” in his customers and looked the other way when dealing with scammers. He referenced the case of one potential witness, a 76-year-old woman who, over six days, transferred her entire life savings – $755,000 – to a romance scammer who then allegedly traded the cash for bitcoins via Freeman, who charged a 10% fee.What bank did the “little old lady” use, Sisti wondered aloud to the jury, that was “so highly regulated” yet missed the classic red flags of her pulling out enormous sums of money in less than a week?“Show me that bank president,” Sisti said. “Because that guy should be sitting next to me [instead of Freeman].”In addition to the unlicensed money transmitting business charges and two counts of money laundering (one that applies to his entire operation and one for allegedly selling bitcoin to an undercover FBI agent posing as a drug dealer), Freeman also faces four counts of tax evasion.“Ian Freeman just doesn’t like to pay taxes,” MacDonald said.Freeman would probably agree with her statement. Though he’s only being charged for attempting to evade taxes from 2016 to 2019, Freeman told New York Magazine last year that he hasn’t paid federal income tax since 2004.He’s not alone. Libertarians, as a general rule, oppose federal taxes, and the phrase “taxation is theft” has become something of a political meme for many.One trial attendee, who introduced himself pseudonymously as “Bear” (“You know, like the right to bear arms?” he explained), told CoinDesk outside the Concord courthouse that he does not pay federal income taxes and, based on the wording of the U.S. Constitution, does not believe anyone besides government employees are subject to taxes.The question of how to get around taxes is a common one in libertarian circles, and bitcoin – at least in its salad days, before the development of sophisticated blockchain analytics and high-profile arrests of crypto criminals – was touted as a potential solution.Read more: How Tax Protesters Set Off the Bitcoin RevolutionMany major figures in crypto, from ShapeShift founder Erik Voorhees to Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, were inspired by the libertarian use-case for cryptocurrency – but times are changing.As the industry has matured and grown it has attracted the attention of both mainstream investors and regulators, and has subsequently undergone a makeover. “New” crypto is (at least in appearance) regulated and polished, and many industry leaders like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong work hand in glove with the U.S. government.Bitcoin-as-currency is increasingly uncommon, as is intentionally picking fights with regulators, making Freeman and those like him feel like relics of bitcoin’s crypto-anarchist past.Though they have been largely sidelined by the current iteration of the industry, crypto libertarians like Freeman are still active, especially in libertarian strongholds such as Keene, where ""Free Talk Radio"" is headquartered.Many came out to Concord to show support for Freeman on the first day of his trial. Observers in bitcoin T-shirts peppered the courtroom benches, and an overflow room had to be set up for attendees after lunch.“I’ve never seen the courtroom like that,” one security officer told CoinDesk, referencing the number of attendees.Protesters also gathered in front of the courthouse. One man, wearing a custom-made bitcoin mascot costume, told CoinDesk he’d paid a quarter of a bitcoin to have a seamstress make it for the inevitable trial when the Crypto 6 were arrested in 2021. He said he and his husband had made the 29-hour drive from Denver, Colorado, to attend the trial.Freeman’s trial, which began Tuesday, is slated to last approximately three weeks, with both sides listing dozens of potential witnesses.Renee Spinella, Freeman’s former girlfriend and alleged accomplice, is expected to testify against him.Though prosecutors dropped 17 of the initial 25 felony charges against Freeman ahead of the trial, the eight remaining counts carry a weighty 70-year maximum penalty if Freeman is found guilty.",2022/12/07
201,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin, ether and other major cryptos traded sideways, albeit slightly to the green.Insights: Asia is ready for a scaled-up, crypto-friendly bank.Bitcoin Watches and Waits From Its $17K PerchBy James RubinBitcoin spent another day watching and waiting.The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading just above $17,000, up a smidgen of a percentage point over the past 24 hours and roughly around its level of the past two weeks as investors continued to weigh economic indicators suggesting the U.S. Federal Reserve still had work to do on the inflation front. BTC has remained tethered to the $17,000 handhold it grabbed eight days ago when signs pointed to the Federal Reserve retreating from its ultra-monetary hawkishness.But in a speech at the Brookings Institute on Dec. 1, Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated the bank might raise interest rates higher than expected in 2023 even as it contemplated lowering its next rate hike later this month from its current fare of 75 basis points (bps) increases to 50 bps. ""The positive market response to the Powell speech suggests that macro conditions will still play a substantial part in BTC's price discovery onwards,"" Arcane Research, which provides analysis of digital asset trends, wrote in a newsletter on Tuesday.Arcane added, however that separate from reaction to Powell's remarks, markets have stayed ""directionless ... as BTC has spent the first six days of December floating in a narrow trading range near $17,000. The market slowdown is reflected in severely reduced trading volumes in spot and derivatives markets, and the last month seems to have caused market participants to shy [away from] the crypto market.""Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,260, up slightly since Monday, same time. Most other major altcoins were recently in the green with AXS, the token of gaming platform Axie Infinity, rising more than 4.5% to continue a recent surge. SUSHI, the token of decentralized exchange Sushiswap, was off more than 10%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, climbed 0.33%.In an increasingly common pattern, crypto prices veered from U.S. equity indexes, which sank amid inflationary worries and macroeconomic uncertainties that have plagued 2022. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged 2% and the S&P 500, with its strong technology component, tumbled 1.4%.Arcane wrote that the crypto market's more than week-long calm has stemmed from ""a trader exodus"" following the collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX. ""The crypto market has mostly traded as one coordinated organism in the last week evident by all indexes trading in a very flat environment,"" Arcane wrote.In an emailed market analysis, Mark Conners, head of research at digital asset manager 3iQ, noted that institutions have been ""doubling down on the promise of blockchain and digital assets, despite the FTX filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and other contagion. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Goldman Sachs (GS), one of the world's largest investment banks, was looking to spend tens of millions of dollars on crypto firms whose valuations have been hit hard by FTX's implosion.3iQ's Connors also highlighted Fidelity's new retail-focused digital asset offering and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink's comments on decentralized finance's potential. He also noted a Financial Times op-ed by BNY Mellon CEO Robin Vince, who called for an ""embrace digital asset innovation."" Vance also wrote that ""a comprehensive regulatory framework is needed, but much of the underpinning already exists and can be extended from the regulation of traditional assets. There is a path to be found.""Asia Ready for a Crypto Friendly BankBy Sam ReynoldsThe short sellers are circling around Silvergate Bank, concerned about its exposure to FTX and falling digital asset prices. But while the bank’s exposure to the FTX exchange is limited, its problem is that it is wholly reliant on U.S. regulations.While Silvergate doesn’t have any outstanding loans to FTX, the failed crypto exchange represents just 10% of the bank’s $11.9 billion in total deposits. It’s not a worst-case scenario, but the concentration of deposits is alarming to some short sellers: Coinbase, Paxos, Crypto.com and Kraken are the bank’s next largest customers.Silvergate's smaller rival Signature seems to be cognizant of the issue, and recently announced that it intends to shrink its crypto exposure. Investors are signaling that it's as good as time as ever to reduce crypto exposure, as Silvergate's stock has underperformed bitcoin itself, and also KRE, a regional bank ETF that holds shares in many similar-sized banks.And all of Silvergate's major customers are based in the U.S. For a bank that specializes in an asset class that is, in theory, decentralized, the bank’s book is heavily centralized around the U.S. regulatory regime.The exact regulatory response to FTX’s collapse hasn’t been written yet. But lawmakers are eager to understand what happened, and there’s been talk of establishing significant guardrails to ensure that what occurred doesn’t happen again.We can all agree that the FTX-Alameda structure was problematic, but lawmakers are bound to look beyond that and do what they can to heavily restrict future crypto trading in the U.S. Onshore crypto trading isn’t going to look the same in the U.S. in 2023 and beyond – and Silvergate is going to be stuck dealing with this much-more-regulated reality.But the U.S. isn’t the only regulatory regime in town. Around Asia there are countries and territories with much more industry-friendly rulebooks that provide regulatory clarity, an absence about which many U.S. stakeholders have complained.Sure, some such as Singapore discourage retail trading, but make up for it with a high concentration of institutions and family offices that trade. Then there’s Thailand, which bans meme coins and some non-fungible tokens (NFT), citing a lack of substance, but doesn’t discourage retail crypto trading if rules can be followed.""...To protect consumers, we need regulatory guidance for companies that ensures trust and transparency. There's a reason why most crypto trading is offshore – companies have 0 guidance on how to comply here in the U.S.,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse tweeted in mid-November.""Compare that with Singapore, which has a licensing framework, token taxonomy laid out, and much more. They can appropriately regulate crypto b/c they've done the work to define what 'good' looks like, and know all tokens aren’t securities (despite what [SEC Chair Gary Gensler] insists),"" he added in a follow-up tweet.If crypto gradually moves offshore because of reactionary over-regulation in the U.S., Silvergate will have no exposure to this.Instead, crypto-friendly banks abroad, like Thailand’s SCB (which is actively investing in crypto infrastructure) or DBS will take up this niche.

Despite investors’ nervousness about industry contagion linked to crypto exchange FTX’s implosion and other crises, BTC's share of the total crypto market has held steady at around 40%, countering its history of rising sharply during stressful times. Observers said the stagnant dominance rate reflects an exodus of investors from the market, among other factors.Chainlink (LINK): The provider of price feeds and other data to blockchains has introduced staking of its native token LINK to its network to help keep the protocol secure. Staking will provide incentives that will enable the Chainlink system to grow, according to Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov. He said the Chainlink network has enabled more than $6.6 trillion in transaction value this year. LINK was recently trading around $7, down 1.7% in the past 24 hours.ApeCoin (APE): Over $30 million worth of APE tokens has been deposited into its contract one day after the Ape Foundation opened staking for its APE currency.

Maple said Orthogonal Trading had misrepresented its exposure to Sam Bankman-Fried’s collapsed FTX exchange. Now, officials with Orthogonal Credit have come forward with a Medium post claiming they were kept unapprised on the depth of Orthogonal Trading’s financial troubles and weren’t aware of the hole in the trading book.Crypto-friendly bank Silvergate shares are adding to their roughly 50% decline since the FTX collapse, falling another 6.15% and touching a new 52-week low in Tuesday morning trade. The drop came after Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), John Kennedy (R-La.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), in a letter late Monday evening, asked Silvergate for answers to its supposed role in facilitating transfers between bankrupt exchange FTX and its sister firm, Alameda Research.Macro continued to struggle on Tuesday. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 closed down 2% and 1.44%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1.03% as investors weighed the U.S. central bank’s likely 50 basis point interest rate hike at its next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Dec. 14.West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures, which try to anticipate the price of the energy benchmark and reflect market trends, dropped 3.3% to $74 a barrel. “Energy traders are not confidently buying dips, but they will if the current sell-off sends prices close to the levels the Biden Administration might refill the [Strategic Petroleum Reserve], which is in the $70 region,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst of the Americas at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Tuesday note.",2022/12/06

In its update on Tuesday, the company said it has now written off $8 million of that total, and expects to recover about $22 million of the $42 million still remaining.That would leave $20 million of the deposit still unaccounted for, and Marathon said it continues ""to work with the various parties involved to determine [its] ultimate recoverability.""In addition to that $50 million deposit, Marathon previously said that it invested $10 million in convertible preferred stock and $21.3 million in an unsecured senior promissory note in different entities within Compute North.Read more: Troubled Data Center Compute North Struggled With Crypto Winter.

It implies BTC is trading cheaply on a relative basis and foreshadows likely future trends.MVRV readings above 3.7 indicate that an asset is overvalued, while readings below 1 indicate that an asset is undervalued.With a current reading of 0.85, bitcoin’s MVRV ratio has fallen to levels last seen in 2019, implying that current prices present a compelling entry point for long biased investors. For context, BTC prices were trading sub $5,000 during that time period.Bitcoin’s current relative strength index (RSI), however, implies that BTC's price is fairly valued, given its current reading of 48. RSI ranges from 0-100, with readings above 70 implying that prices are overvalued and those below 30 indicating the opposite. RSI’s reflect likely, immediate price movement.Despite the neutral reading, a look at historical pricing when BTC’s RSI trades at or around 48 shows a hint of promise. In over 120 occurrences since 2015, following a reading between 47 and 49,BTC has increased on average 6% after 90 days and 2% after seven days.A look at BTC’s Bollinger Bands shows a series of six consecutive narrow-range trading days, with prices briefly touching the upper range of its bands and now trending in the direction of the 20-day moving average.The narrow trading range implies a lack of conviction among traders. The reversion to the 20-day average suggests that BTC is trading relatively close to where it should be.To be sure, the discrepancy between the indicators is small.MVRV holds primary relevance for investors, who tend to look longer term for payoffs. RSI and Bollinger Bands are most relevant for traders, who seek to accumulate gains more quickly.Ultimately, the MVRV ratio appears to be a valid indication of BTC’s current intrinsic value. Technical indicators such as the RSI and Bollinger Band indicate the length of time in which BTC will remain undervalued.Investors who are long bitcoin have an opportunity to acquire bitcoin as it trades near three-year lows relative to its realized value, but only if they can tolerate current price levels, which are unlikely to move much for the foreseeable future.",2022/12/06
205,"Texas is offering an interim, voluntary power curtailment program for “Large Flexible Loads (LFL),” intended to give bitcoin miners incentives to lower their power consumption during periods of high electricity demand.The program should help the state’s grid operator, Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), ease worries about mining adding extra stress during periods of high system demand.“Due to the anticipated interconnection of an increasing number of large flexible Loads in the ERCOT Region, ERCOT is establishing an interim, voluntary curtailment program that would allow these Loads to assist ERCOT in ensuring reliability during periods of high system demand,” ERCOT said in a statement.LFLs are large-scale power consumers that have the ability to turn on and off electricity uses at a moment’s notice in order to divert energy to other grid participants. Bitcoin miners and data centers are the main type of LFLs that operate in Texas. They require immense amounts of energy and have been able to curtail their power consumption during the peak power demand with a flick of a switch.The temporary program is expected to go live on or about Jan. 1, 2023, according to ERCOT. However, the program might be terminated at any time because ERCOT said it plans to develop a permanent reliability framework for LFLs.The miners have already been curtailing their operations during winter storms and heat waves in Texas to serve the grid’s energy needs via so-called demand response programs. As participants of the program, the miners power down their operations in exchange for energy credits they can use in the future, thus releasing power back to the struggling grid.However, the practice has come under scrutiny recently as a group of seven Democratic lawmakers in Washington, D.C., led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has questioned the impact of the miners' power usage on the grid and how it's affecting local consumers.Earlier in July, Texas’ Large Flexible Load Task Force discussed the possibility of integrating bitcoin mining operations into the ERCOT system, which was described as “the core issues that must be resolved.”Read more: The End of the Texas Bitcoin Mining Gold Rush",2022/12/06
206,"Hedge fund Fir Tree is suing crypto investment firm Grayscale to obtain details about its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) in order to investigate potential mismanagement and conflicts of interest, according to a report from Bloomberg.Fir Tree wants Grayscale to resume redemptions and cut fees for the trust, which is the largest publicly traded crypto fund in the world, with $10.7 billion in assets. It allows U.S. investors to gain exposure to the price movement of bitcoin without buying the asset itself.GBTC is selling at close to a record 43% discount to the price of the underlying bitcoin in the trust and is down almost 75% this year in the wake of bitcoin's sharp decline and the collapse of several high-profile crypto firms such as FTX. Fir Tree wants to use the information it's seeking to pressure Grayscale to resume redemptions, which are not immediately available to investors, and to cut fees from the current 2%, according to Bloomberg's sources.Fir Tree is known for making a large short bet against the stablecoin tether earlier this year.A Grayscale spokesperson told CoinDesk the company's ""mission is to help investors access the ever-evolving crypto ecosystem through familiar, secure, and transparent investment vehicles.

207,"In the current whirlwind of dismay and disappointment (or should I say shock and shame?), many in the Bitcoin ecosystem are no doubt fondly remembering simpler times when the bitcoin currency crashing was all we had to stress about. In 2011, BTC’s drawdown reached 93%, a market cap loss of $172 million. The 2014-15 crypto winter saw bitcoin market cap lose over 80%, wiping out $11.3 billion of value. Sigh, those were the days.Obviously, I’m not serious – that time was, no doubt, shockingly painful for anyone in the industry back then. The Mt. Gox implosion at one stage felt existential – sure, the Bitcoin blockchain would continue to exist after the largest exchange turned out to be engaged in fraud, but would anyone care? The fallout, however, was limited to a relatively small circle of libertarians, cryptographic experimenters and the techno-curious. It was barely covered in the mainstream press. This turned out to be a blessing because the bruised could get to work rebuilding, out of the glare of mainstream attention.Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.The contrast with today’s market could not be more stark because the world has been flooded with a torrent of headlines covering every possible angle of the FTX exchange’s implosion. Wednesday’s Andrew Ross Sorkin/Sam Bankman-Fried interview at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit was viewed by probably hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people. The extent of the fallout is as yet unknown, there is serious talk about how it might impact traditional finance and skeptics feel they should be involved in shaping what the reconstruction might look like. The damage has hit thousands of assets, costing almost $160 billion in market cap.Back in 2011-2015, bitcoin was the whole market. Now, that is far from the case. This is unreservedly good – the range of technological spin-offs and evolving use cases has probably surprised even the most optimistic of the early adopters. And the rapid spread of interest and adoption has grown the value of the entire market. It has also, through diversification, reduced overall market risk.This last assertion may sound out of place, given the implosion the industry has just witnessed. But it has been an industry implosion much more than a market implosion. The market still works. Crypto assets (with a couple of notable exceptions) are still doing what they do. Bitcoin still produces secure blocks, Ethereum still pays staking rewards, decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens continue to incentivize platform participation, value is still transferred on-chain. The market infrastructure has changed; the market itself, not so much.Read more: Steps to Crypto Recovery: Where 'We' Go From Here | OpinionWe can see this in a key metric that serves as an indicator of sentiment, and that I subliminally introduced in the previous paragraphs: bitcoin dominance. This is simply the percentage of total crypto market cap accounted for by BTC, and is tracked through the BTC.D index. Up until the emergence of Ethereum in 2015, it was around 99% (a few smaller tokens had emerged, none of which gained significant traction). Ethereum’s early success triggered a Cambrian explosion of innovation, new tokens emerged at an astonishing pace and the initial coin offering frenzy of 2017 pushed bitcoin’s dominance down to 37%. The drop coincided with a 470% increase in the overall crypto market cap in the space of approximately three months.This introduces a salient feature of bitcoin’s dominance: its role as a sentiment gauge. In times of high speculation, such as in late 2017, BTC.D drops. BTC is the least volatile of the nonstablecoin crypto assets, and when traders and short-term investors are feeling confident they tend to prefer the high risk/high reward offered by some of the smaller tokens.The 2018 crash and the ensuing bear market reversed that trend. The speculative assets fell by much more than the relatively “stable” bitcoin and its dominance climbed, reaching over 70% in August 2019. Then the market got confident again, new layer 1 blockchains attracted attention, and BTC.D headed down, reaching 58% a year later. We then saw an unusual phenomenon – a speculative market in which bitcoin was a star performer. In August 2020, MicroStrategy announced its first major BTC purchase; in the following weeks, several other firms, funds and millionaires revealed BTC holdings. The institutions had arrived.In early 2021, BTC corrected from its highs just as institutional and celebrity interest in other tokens started to take off, with a flurry of new funds, new listings and new services. BTC.D dropped as lower-cap tokens took the spotlight, outshining BTC’s performance even as it reached its all-time high of $69,000 on Nov. 10. The following chart shows how the normally high 60-day correlation between BTC and other tokens dropped sharply during this period.We’re getting to the weird part: BTC.D spiked during this year’s May/June market drama along with a rotation into the relatively “safe” crypto asset, although the metric remained below 50%. It then understandably declined as the dust settled. But it hasn’t really moved since, even though there has been plenty of cause for fear.Over the month of November, as the FTX contagion rippled through the system, crypto’s market cap lost 15%. Yet, BTC.D oscillated between 40.0% and 40.9%. It can’t possibly be telling us that sentiment is flat.Has BTC.D lost its role as a sentiment gauge? That would imply that BTC has lost its role as the “safe” crypto asset. Or could there be something else going on?It’s possible that BTC has not outperformed other crypto assets because, rather than rotate into relative safety, investors have largely left the market. BTC spot volumes have dropped to local lows after the panic spike earlier this month. But they are still above levels at the beginning of the year, while those for ETH are notably lower. This feels like an exit but not a massive one.It's more likely that we are witnessing the consolidation of the crypto market’s speculative nature.This may sound alarming as many of us now instinctively recoil at the thought of more speculation, after the damage done to portfolios and reputation by shady actors over the past year. We also flinch just imagining how regulators are sharpening their knives to excise heightened risk from the market. All this is reasonable, as is the relief felt by builders and creators that the industry can focus on the constructive aspects of crypto potential now that risky froth has been washed out.Only, it hasn’t. We’re seeing this not only in the flat BTC.D but also in the performance of some smaller tokens. Over the past month, one of the worst for crypto in recent memory, litecoin (LTC), is up over 25%, OKEx’s token OKB is up more than 36%, the Binance ecosystem wallet’s token TWT is up over 110% and DeFi exchange GMX’s token is up over 33%. The past week has produced scores of 10+% jumps among medium-cap tokens such as dogecoin, AAVE and Uniswap, among others.The FTX implosion has not removed speculation; nor has macro uncertainty plus the broad withdrawal of liquidity from crypto and traditional markets. What will? Nothing. Speculation is here to stay.As much as some of us may wish it away, speculation is a feature of free markets. It is also a feature of sophisticated ones, and we want crypto markets to be both. Speculators may be all about buying an asset and selling at a higher price (or selling an asset and buying lower if they’re shorting) rather than actually contributing to a project’s growth. But that is a key feature of markets – the freedom to buy and sell at prices we deem fair. Without the ability to express different opinions, markets become predictable and altogether uninteresting.See also: After FTX: Rebuilding Trust in Crypto's Founding Mission | OpinionThey also become less useful – speculators may contribute to volatility, but they also enhance price discovery by reflecting opinions weighted by capital, closing arbitrage gaps and providing exit liquidity.Speculation is not harmless: It can destabilize markets, especially if done with high leverage. But in most cases the issue is more with the facilitating platforms than with the trading behavior. Many critics point to the price distortions as evidence of speculative damage, conflating aggressive trading with market manipulation. In the confusing aftermath of the FTX implosion, even industry insiders are assuming that speculation rather than a violation of trust was at fault. And for many of us who are in this industry because of its potential to improve financial freedom and integrity, the desperate rush for returns feels, well, uncomfortably superficial.Speculation bashing may align with many core crypto values, and it does have a certain cathartic utility, but it is pointless. The strange behavior of BTC.D during the recent turmoil tells us that the market composition has changed. Bitcoin is still the anchor asset, by a wide margin, but the volatility of its protagonism is weakening. This is a sign of a maturing asset class. That this should become apparent during one of the industry’s darkest times is cause for hope.",2022/12/06
208,"While some expect bitcoin (BTC) to catch up with the recent rally in stocks, Singapore-based crypto options trading firm QCP Capital suggests otherwise.According to QCP Capital, stocks have overtaken fundamentals and could soon fall back.""We say this because the two-year Treasury yield, which has been a reliable indicator of the market's direction all year, is, in fact, moving in line with BTC and ETH, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have rallied away,"" QCP said in Monday's market update.Risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, have mostly moved in the opposite direction to the two-year U.S. Treasury yield this year as the Federal Reserve embarked on its most aggressive rate hike cycle in decades. The two-year yield closely tracks the near-term interest rate and inflation expectations.While bitcoin and ether continue to respect the negative correlation with the two-year yield, stocks have decoupled since mid-October on hopes that inflation has peaked and the Fed will pivot toward liquidity-boosting rate cuts in the second half of next year.The chart by QCP compares the inverted graph of the two-year yield with the S&P 500, Nasdaq, bitcoin and ether going back to January.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have chalked up double-digit gains since mid-October, moving away from the two-year yield. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has dropped 6%.If bond markets, considered more rational and unsentimental than equities, believed in the narrative, the two-year yield would have seen a sharp drop. In other words, the inverted graph of the two-year yield would be much higher and in sync with the indices than it is right now.Therefore, stocks appear to have run ahead of themselves in pricing the Fed pivot.The relative resilience of the two-year yield compared to the 10-year yield suggests the same. The two-year note yielded 4.40% at press time – 48 basis points less than the year-to-date high of 4.88% reached on Nov. 4. On the contrary, the 10-year note yielded 3.55%, or 75 basis points less compared to the 2022 high of 4.33% hit on Oct. 21.The two-year yield could climb toward 5%, putting downward pressure on risk assets.That's because the new projections from the Fed's 19 policymakers scheduled for release next week are likely to show rates continuing to rise next year and peaking at the terminal rate above 5%, contradicting hopes for rate cuts next year.""Assuming the two-year yield is still the market's way of pricing the Fed's terminal rate next year, then we potentially still have more downside, as the Fed warns it will now hike rates past 5%,"" QCP noted.",2022/12/06

In prior cycles, investors would move into BTC to protect the downside when the market fell off. But because of the size of this year's scandals and their far-reaching impacts, a lot of investors aren't moving to BTC because they're just leaving the space entirely,"" Hansen added.The collapse of FTX, which had its tentacles in every nook and corner of the crypto market, has been the biggest in a string of big crypto-related failures this year and brought down several firms, including crypto lender BlockFi.Bitcoin has the most liquidity and is the least volatile of all cryptocurrencies, except for stablecoins. Therefore, crypto investors have tended to move money into BTC when they feel less confident about the overall market condition.Investors sought shelter in bitcoin in the first half of this year as the Federal Reserve's hawkish turn and Terra's implosion led to a crash in the broader crypto market. The safe-haven bid for bitcoin lifted its dominance rate from 39% to 48%. A similar bump was seen during the market swoon of May and June 2021 as well as during the 2018 bear market.That's not happening this time, however, as traders are moving to cash. According to Hansen, registered investment advisors have been the largest group of defectors from the crypto market.Holding stablecoins – cryptocurrencies with values pegged to an external reference like the U.S. dollar – is a better option for investors, according to Richard Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR.""There are many risks, including from macro markets and the risk perceived in holding crypto on an exchange, post-FTX. Moving to stablecoins is a most defensive posture, vs. moving into BTC, which is still a volatile asset in the end,"" Rosenblum told CoinDesk when asked if stablecoins have replaced BTC as crypto market safe havens.Rosenblum, however, cautioned against reading too much into the dominance rate, as people leaving the market amid a prolonged price swoon is normal and doesn't necessarily imply the end of the world for crypto.""It is an oversimplification to look at dominance in itself as a metric. It had more meaning in 2017 or 2018. Now there are a lot more components, both in crypto and how other asset classes and events impact the space,"" he said.Bitcoin no longer represents a major chunk of development happening in the crypto industry as it did in 2018 and before.

Gridless serves as the anchor tenant, financing the construction and managing the operation of data centers in rural communities where traditional industrial or commercial customers are unavailable.Gridless brings “a socially and environmentally conscious approach to bitcoin mining, one that provides tangible benefits by way of access to electricity for communities in rural parts of East Africa,” Alyse Killeen, managing partner at Stillmark, said in an announcment.Thomas Templeton, bitcoin mining and wallet lead at Block, added: “Gridless represents a close strategic alignment with our vision of ensuring the bitcoin network increasingly leverages clean energy, in combination with bitcoin computational centers around the world.”The funding comes as Africa experiences a grassroots crypto movement. It has the world's highest proportion of retail payments of less than $1,000 and more peer-to-peer transactions proportionally than any other region. Bitcoin miners, however, have been struggling to survive amid this year’s grueling market conditions, which have seen bitcoin (BTC) prices fall and energy costs surge, reducing profit margins.In recent months, though, mining companies that have access to low-cost energy and more innovative business models have succeeded in raising capital.In August, a new solar-powered bitcoin miner, Aspen Creek Digital Corp., raised $8 million in a Series A funding round, and Vespene Energy, a company that converts methane gas released from landfills into power for bitcoin mining, closed a $4.3 million funding round.",2022/12/06
213,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin and other crypto prices fall along with other riskier assets amid concerns the U.S. economy isn't slowing enough.Insights: Is Taiwan's technology manufacturer HTC betting too much on the success of the metaverse? The company is reportedly looking to take its virtual headset unit public in the U.S.Bitcoin Has a Sinking FeelingBy James RubinCrypto markets didn't like the sound of good economic news, sending prices downward on Monday.Bitcoin was recently trading down 1.1% over the past 24 hours, although it clung above its $17,000 support of the last six days. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has seemingly recovered from a mid-November swoon following the implosion of crypto exchange FTX, although it remains subject to more minor winds that have had it dipping and rising in smallish increments on larger macroeconomic events.On Monday, the Institute of Supply Management's unexpectedly strong November services index fueled fears anew that the U.S. economy would require the U.S. Federal Reserve to administer a longer-term dosage of harsh interest rate hikes than had been hoped in mid-November when the Consumer Price Index fell. The ISM services report came just three days after a hot jobs report raised concerns that the economy was not contracting enough and that inflation would remain problematic. In recent months, inflationary worries have often dictated the performance of asset markets.""Bitcoin’s earlier gains evaporated after a hot ISM services report fueled bets that the Fed could tighten much more than markets are currently pricing,"" wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda.Ether was recently changing hands above $1,260, down more than 2% from Sunday, same time. Other major cryptos spent much of the day in the red with CRO, the token of the Crypto.com exchange off more than 4% and DOT, the cryptocurrency of blockchain interoperability protocol Polkadot, sinking more than 3%. AXS, the token of gaming platform Axie Infinity, was up nearly 20% to trade at more than $8.40.Crypto prices largely tracked equity markets, which sank amid interest rate concerns fueled by the ISM report. The tech heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, dropped 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively. The Wall Street Journal reported that food and beverage giant PepsiCo would be laying off hundreds of workers in North America amid company worries about shrinking volume.Meanwhile, the recent decline in U.S. consumer savings rates to their second lowest level in 60 years suggest that crypto markets are likely to remain calm for at least the near future, wrote CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams on Monday. ""As retail investors comprise a sizable portion of crypto investors, the continued erosion of buying power will likely weigh upon bitcoin and ether prices.,"" Williams wrote. ""We face a cocktail of higher interest rates, decreased buying power and increased levels of debt.""And Katie Talati, head of research at crypto investment firm Arca, noted with cautious optimism on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program that crypto prices have likely bottomed out. ""I don't make price predictions, but I think we probably saw the bottom in terms of market prices and sentiment in the last few weeks,"" Talati said.By Sam ReynoldsTaipei-based technology manufacturer HTC is reportedly looking to take its virtual headset business public in the United States, Taiwanese media report, as part of a larger quest to play a pioneering role in the metaverse.But in IPOing its VR business, the company might be making a mistake it made years ago with its electric scooter arm called Gogoro. There are plenty of parallels between the two: What began as a niche product suddenly became more mainstream – and the market didn’t appreciate this. Fundamental questions have also arisen about the future of the metaverse.VR, an HTC bright spotVirtual reality has been a bright spot for HTC, a company that has otherwise seen its balance sheet effectively dissolve during the last decade. At the start of the Obama administration in the U.S., HTC was a mobile phone giant, helping pioneer the Android ecosystem, peaking at a market share of 10% in 2011 and overtaking Nokia in market value, which at the time benefited from financial backing and a partnership with Microsoft.But it has been in free fall since, hitting 2% of the smartphone market share in 2015, and now it is too small to have its shipments tracked by research houses including IDC and Statcounter.Looking to turn the company around, HTC launched the Vive VR headset in 2016 to mixed reviews. It was still a medium in development, with the hardware and software technology languishing behind consumer expectations.Facebook, which acquired Vive-rival Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion, was in a similar conundrum. CNBC said in 2017 that its bet on VR was one of Mark “Zuckerberg’s rare mistakes.” This wasn’t going anywhere as “nobody wants to be social in VR” and there was no compelling game for it.Meanwhile, HTC’s balance sheet was still a sinking ship, and in 2017, Google came to the rescue with a $1.1 billion investment in HTC’s mobile phone manufacturing division so that Google would have a manufacturing partner for its Pixel phones.VR continued to languish for the next few years. Reviewers still saw it as a niche product, with obvious enterprise and commercial applications, but no “killer app” for gamers and retail users that would make a headset a must-have.“The VR revolution is alive and well, it’s just not ready for you,” Gizmodo’s Sam Rutherford wrote in 2019. “It’s [going] to take a bit longer to become mainstream than people initially thought. Be patient, your VR dreams are still alive and well.”Mobile headsets and metaverseVR got its first boost in consumer interest with the release of the stand-alone Oculus Quest headset in 2019, as analysts pointed to the lower price point and its untethered nature as piquing the interests of consumers.As standalone devices powered by the same chips that went into smartphones, they couldn’t push out realistic graphics like PC-tethered headsets, but they were cheap and fun with games finally arriving, which is what consumers wanted.By mid-2021 there was a mini-boom in standalone headsets like the Oculus Quest 2 and Vive Focus. HTC was still a money-losing entity, but its balance sheet was improving.And then came Facebook’s headfirst dive into the metaverse and VR.Quality concerns about Facebook’s VR and metaverse platforms aside, at first, investors were intrigued.In Taiwan, HTC’s stock became a proxy for the metaverse, gaining nearly 130% during the last quarter of 2021. VR headset shipments were growing at a rate not seen since 2016, but HTC faced a competitive market from its rivals.Even as the metaverse bubble popped, and Meta’s stock, along with the metaverse major tokens began their year-long plunge, HTC hasn’t performed that badly.While HTC (2498) has underperformed Taiwan’s TAIEX index year to date, losing 28.6% versus 19%, it has bettered Meta, which is down 63% and Sandbox, which is off 53%.There still is a lot of value to the company, the market has determined, despite the wheels coming off all things metaverse.Parallels to GogoroScooters dominate the road in Taipei, and many belch out exhaust via their two-stroke engines.In 2015, two former HTC executives launched a solution: Gogoro. While electric scooters aren’t a new technology, a network of battery-swapping stations is. The company raised a round of $150 million led by HTC founder Cher Wang, and incubated some of its early tech in its facilities. But it passed on the opportunity to make it a full subsidiary.While Gogoro had its initial skeptics, in the years since it has managed to grab a 9% market share. In April 2022, the company went public on the Nasdaq via a SPAC but investors weren’t that impressed.Year to date, the company has posted losses of 62%, compared to HTC’s 30%. While Gogoro does have solid cash flow and licensing agreements for its battery-swapping technology, it isn’t profitable, only posting net income during the last quarter because of a favorable charge on warrants on the books.Certainly, if Vive were to be spun off into an initial public offering there would be similar results. We don’t know how much Vive accounts for revenue at HTC, as it is bundled together with smartphones and other electronic equipment. But it's likely not profitable.Gogoro was pushed early into an initial public offering because its backers, like HTC’s Cher Wang, needed a quick buck (HTC is a money-losing entity, after all). Wang probably regrets not buying a more significant stake of Gogoro as an investor and bringing it closer into the HTC fold, as it would undoubtedly be a success story for the company – and a more proven product than VR.Despite the advancements of the last four years, VR still needs more time for incubation. Vive’s performance on the stock market will be predictable, and likely just track the ups and downs of Meta. But HTC needs the cash infusion, and there’s no obvious private buyer available.The company is hoping the metaverse finds a firm foothold.11:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(3:30 UTC) Reserve Bank of Australia Interest Rate Decision9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) United States Goods and Services Trade Balance (Oct)11:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(15:00 UTC) Canada's Ivey Purchasing Managers Index (Nov) In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Most Influential 2022; Genesis Creditor Groups' Loans Amount to $1.8B and Counting: Sources$1.8 billion and possibly more.

214,"The difficulty of mining a bitcoin block fell by 7.32%, with miners powering off machines as a brutal bear market eats into profit.The adjustment at block height 766,080 is the biggest downward change since July 2021, data from mining pool BTC.com shows. That was when hordes of miners dropped off the network following China’s ban on the industry. At the time, the country was the world’s biggest bitcoin mining hub.The mining difficulty automatically adjusts according to the hashrate, or computing power, that’s online in order to keep the time it takes to mine a bitcoin block roughly stable: The more miners are working, the higher the difficulty becomes.In the past several months, bitcoin miners have been caught between a stubbornly low price of bitcoin that decreases their revenue and high electricity rates that increase costs. Major producers including Core Scientific (CORZ) and Argo Blockchain (ARBK) are dealing with liquidity crunches, while Compute North filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.The situation has been exacerbated by new, more efficient machines being delivered and more miners coming online as projects started months ago reached fruition, driving the hashrate higher. Between early August and the last upward adjustment on Nov. 21, the hashrate and difficulty both increased by about one-third.The reality of crypto winter now seems to have caught up with the industry, and bitcoin miners are turning off their machines. The hashrate started dropping around mid-November as profitability took a hit. It is, however, still well above the levels seen after China’s crackdown on the industry.The profitability of mining has dropped by about 20% in the past month, according to Luxor’s hashprice indicator.​​At these “depressed profitability levels, even miners using energy-efficient machines like the Antminer S19j Pro need access to electricity priced lower than [8 U.S. cents] per kWh,” said Jaran Mellerud, an analyst at Luxor. Even though the average energy price on the network is about 5 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), many miners are paying about 7 cents to 8 cents per kWh, Mellerud said.On top of that, energy prices have increased in the last few days, along with the price of natural gas. “Miners buying spot electricity and already operating close to breakeven may have seen their electricity prices rise just enough to flip their operations into cash-flow-negative territory,” Mellerud said.This latest lower hashrate and difficulty doesn’t leave the network more vulnerable to attack. The computing power is spread among five big mining pools and another 12 smaller ones, data from BTC.com shows.Read more: Bitcoin Miner Iris Energy Faces Default Claim on $103M of Equipment Loans",2022/12/06
215,"Here’s something that might make you laugh: Arthur Hayes’ Wikipedia page still categorizes him as a “banker.” Indeed, the founder of the BitMEX crypto exchange and derivative trading platform did get his start on the equities side of Deutsche Bank and Citigroup. But that’s like calling a butterfly a caterpillar or a chicken an egg.Since Hayes’ days as a banker he’s lived a thousand lives. He founded the first bitcoin derivatives exchange in 2014, invented the perpetual swap, became crypto’s first African American billionaire, lost vast portions of his wealth and made it back in at least two crypto crashes, allegedly “ran the stops” on his users (his users said, without much evidence), traveled the world speaking on crypto’s conference circuit, once joked on stage about bribing a Seychelles financial regulator “with a coconut,” was said to have run the stops some more, was accused of facilitating money laundering by U.S. federal regulators, was sued by investors, was sued by customers, may have been in Singapore, surrendered to authorities in Hawaii, was put under house arrest and has now – somehow, inexplicably – rebuilt his reputation as a crypto sage by writing multi-thousand-word blog posts.Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022Arthur Hayes has been many things to crypto over the years: a builder, a showman and a criminal. This year, as the industry collapsed around users, he’s been a wise commentator able to bring people through complex topics in the markets and business in a series of blog posts. He’s like Virgil leading pilgrims through the layers of Hell as each new month brings a fresh calamity.In this sense, Hayes is also living proof of something in crypto called the “redemption arc,” where former villains become heroes. For better or worse, crypto has embraced more than its fair share of convicted felons and fraudsters. Not everyone will welcome back FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried or Three Arrows Capital co-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu (who at least appear to be avoiding regulators, a bit like how Hayes was perceived at first). But even convicted fraudsters can earn a seat at the table if they know how to make money.Hayes, for instance, was invited to deliver the farewell keynote at CoinDesk’s inaugural I.D.E.A.S. conference. He had pleaded guilty along with BitMEX co-founders Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed to violating the Bank Secrecy Act in February and is still under two years’ probation. Despite the conditions, Hayes said crypto is still generating new visions and isn’t done innovating, even if it takes time to build back from the bear market.He didn’t say a word about the banking system.CORRECTION (12/5/22 – 20:00 UTC): An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Arthur Hayes spent time in prison, claimed to have bribed a regulator with a coconut and refused to engage with criminal investigators.

216,"The Built With Bitcoin Foundation (BWB), a nonprofit organization seeking to provide “humanitarian support, powered by Bitcoin,” has built a technology center in Kumasi, Ghana.The aptly named “Bitcoin Technology Center” (BTC) will focus on finance and technology education, and aims to “foster a safe environment to learn.” The center’s official unveiling takes place Thursday, on the heels of the African Bitcoin Conference, which is being hosted a few hours away in Accra. BWB is hoping to educate and train at least 400 residents within the first year of operation, according to a press release provided to CoinDesk.The center’s location is no coincidence. Kumasi is home to one of Ghana’s largest and most prestigious universities – Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) – ranked 2019’s “best university in Ghana and West Africa” by media firm U.S. News & World Report. BWB hopes the region’s reputation for stellar technology-focused education translates into high interest in the Bitcoin Technology Center’s programs.“If a community already has a school, but it doesn't have the resources needed, how are they ever going to learn how to use Bitcoin,” said Yusuf Nessary, co-founder and director of BWB, in an interview with CoinDesk. “So we thought to ourselves, what if we build a freestanding multi-room, co-op and incubation center, where community members can come any time of the day?”Read more: South African Non-Profit Bitcoin Ekasi Opens Education CenterThe center will offer an introductory Bitcoin course as well as finance, entrepreneurship and computer programming courses.

218,"Many economic indicators now point to relatively mild price action in the short term for crypto markets.The U.S. Federal Reserve’s likely 50 basis point rate hike at its next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Dec. 14 would be an encouraging retreat from the more hawkish 75 bps increases that resulted from the FOMC's last four meetings.

We face a cocktail of higher interest rates, decreased buying power and increased levels of debt.I’d love to be able to write something other than “bitcoin prices look poised to trade in a range,” but that’s where we are. Over the past week, BTC and ETH prices have stabilized at about $17,000 and $1,300, respectively. Volatility for both (as measured by the Average True Range) has fallen 47% and 45%, respectively.Momentum for both, as measured by their Relative Strength Index readings, is neutral as well, with both sitting at 50. Volume for both assets have trailed their respective 20-day moving averages, which implies a lack of trading interest.So for all the noise and uncertainty surrounding crypto markets following the collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX and other industry debacles, crypto prices have remained quiet.Part of that quiet is evident on-chain, when looking at the behavior of whale investors – those investors holding at least 1,000 BTC on centralized exchanges.For example, upticks in whales sending BTC to exchanges between March and June, and October and November this year coincided with 50% and 14% decreases in BTC’s price during those periods.Recently, whale net positions have flattened.

219,"Riot Blockchain (RIOT), one of the world's largest publicly traded bitcoin miners, is switching its mining pool to ensure “more predictable results” for its operations, the company said after failing to produce expected monthly bitcoins.Riot said that it achieved record hashrate capacity in November with computing power reaching 7.7 exahash per seconds (EH/s), 12% higher than 6.9 EH/s in October, according to a statement. However, the miner produced 521 bitcoin in November, lower than the 660 it expected to mine, due to a payment variance in the mining pool it was using.Riot mined only 2% more bitcoin in November than the previous month. Meanwhile, it mined 43% more bitcoins in October versus September.“Variance in a mining pool can impact results and while this variance should balance out over time, can be volatile in the short term,” Riot CEO Jason Les said in the statement. “This variance led to lower bitcoin production than expected in November, relative to our hashrate,” he added.A mining pool is like a lottery syndicate, where several miners “pool” their computing power to get a steady stream of bitcoin rewards. Joining a pool of other miners improves the odds significantly of solving a block and winning a reward, although the payout gets split among all members.Read more: What Are Bitcoin Mining Pools?Publicly listed miners are usually secretive about the mining pool they use. However, a person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk that Riot was previously using Braiins, formerly known as Slush Pool, for its mining pool.Most mining pools use several payout methods offering consistent rewards to its pool members. The majority of pools use a method called Full-Pay-Per-Share (FPPS).Braiins is one of only a few mining pools that uses a mechanism called Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares (PPLNS), which introduces significant variance into its members' rewards. That variance likely contributed to Riot’s lower number of bitcoin rewards, according to the person.Other payment methods usually ensure miners always get paid, even if the pool doesn’t find a block. However, PPLNS only pays miners after a block has been found by the pool, and then the pool goes back to check for valid shares contributed by each miner before winning a block. The miners then get paid in bitcoin rewards, based on those valid shares contributed by each miner during that time.To avoid such variance, Riot decided to switch its mining pool, which “offers a more consistent reward mechanism, so that Riot will fully benefit from our rapidly growing hash rate capacity as we work towards our goal of reaching 12.5 EH/s in the first quarter of 2023,” Les said. Riot didn’t specify to which pool it will be shifting.Braiins declined to comment on the story.Miners are already facing a tough crypto winter as bitcoin's declining price and higher energy costs have eaten into profit margins, causing a few miners to file for bankruptcy protection. Predictable and consistent mining rewards, which are miners' main revenue source, are of utmost importance. The margin of error has been increasingly narrow this year amid the current tough conditions.Riot shares fell about 7% on Monday, while its peer Marathon Digital (MARA) was down more than 12%. Bitcoin was recently down about 1.2% in price.Read more: Bitcoin Miners’ FTX Contagion Exposure May Amplify Industry Pain",2022/12/05

Luego, la valoración se duplicó cuando las dos empresas modificaron sus términos en febrero de este año.Sigue a CoinDesk en Español.En un tuit, el CEO de Circle, Jeremy Allaire, atribuyó la rescisión al hecho de no haber completado la “calificación a tiempo” de la Comisión de Bolsa y Valores (SEC, por sus siglas en inglés) de Estados Unidos.“Creo que la SEC ha sido rigurosa y exhaustiva a la hora de entender nuestro negocio y muchos de los aspectos novedosos de esta industria”, agregó. “Este tipo de revisión es necesario para, en última instancia, ofrecer seguridad, transparencia y responsabilidad a las empresas de criptomonedas más importantes”.La empresa también afirmó que fue rentable en el tercer trimestre de este año y que terminó el período con casi US$400 millones en efectivo no restringido.La cancelación se produce luego de que otras empresas de criptomonedas de alto perfil cancelaran sus planes de cotizar en bolsa a través de una SPAC, como la plataforma de trading eToro en julio y el minero de bitcoin PrimeBlock en agosto.En los últimos años, las SPAC se han convertido en un medio común para que las empresas cotizaran en bolsa, y en marzo la SEC informó que representaban la mitad de todas las ofertas públicas iniciales (OPI, por sus siglas en inglés) de 2020 y 2021.La SEC dijo que propondría “requisitos especializados de divulgación con respecto a la compensación pagada a los patrocinadores, los conflictos de interés, la dilución y la equidad de estas transacciones de combinación comerciales, entre otras”, como una señal de que cotizar en la bolsa sea sujeto a un escrutinio regulatorio mucho mayor.Este artículo fue traducido por Natalia Paulovsky.",2022/12/05

This gives us a chance to recognize the good as well as the bad.Though it may seem like the cryptoverse suffered an entire year of calamity and failures, it has been only a tumultuous six months. Most of the first half of 2022 was pretty stable – for crypto – still buoyed by a strong 2021, growing mainstream interest and optimism.As the collapse of the FTX empire is still fresh and unraveling, the failures and likely crimes exposed this year are what we will likely remember most.

222,"To some, the name Tamara Lich invokes visions of semi-trailer trucks blaring their horns and large crowds of protestors chanting, “Freedom!”To others, especially those in crypto, Lich is a defendant in a class-action lawsuit that represents a defining moment in Canada’s crypto history: the first time private citizens successfully petitioned a judge to grant a Mareva injunction and thereby “freeze” cryptocurrency wallets (although so far, the injunction seems to have been only partially successful).So what’s a Mareva injunction? The name “Mareva” comes from the original 1975 English case: Mareva Compania Naviera SA v. International Bulkcarriers SA. In Canada (which has a separate and independent legal system from the United Kingdom), if a purported fraud victim, or plaintiff, sues an alleged fraudster, or defendant, the plaintiff can request the court proactively freeze the defendant’s assets before the trial. This prevents the defendant from disposing of the assets to avoid paying the plaintiff in the event of an unfavorable civil judgment.Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022Lich became a Mareva defendant, and the face of the so-called Canada “Freedom Convoy,” due to her role in organizing and raising funds for the month-long protests that sought to pressure politicians to remove Canada’s COVID-19 mandates.She didn’t act alone, but as one of the more popular figures (if not the most popular) among the protests’ organizers, she became the face of the protest movement. Embittered downtown Ottawa residents (where the protests took place from Jan. 22 to Feb. 23, 2022) named her (and 79 other defendants) in a class-action lawsuit seeking over C$306 million (currently US$228 million) in “compensation for damages inflicted upon those who live, carry on business, or work in the [Ottawa] downtown core.”Court documents show Lich was “the organizer of the Freedom Convoy’s fundraiser on the crowdsourced fundraising platforms GoFundMe and GiveSendGo.” According to The National Post, a Canadian newspaper, the convoy raised over $24 million, most of which was returned to donors after GoFundMe raised concerns about the nature of the protests. GiveSendGo followed suit after being forced to halt the campaign via a court order initiated by the Ontario provincial government.Read more: Court Orders Freeze of Canadian 'Freedom Convoy' Crypto FundraisingDuring the final days of the demonstrations, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act for the first time in the country’s history. This gave the federal government additional powers to help quell the protests, such as the ability to freeze bank accounts linked to the Freedom Convoy and its supporters.With traditional funding mechanisms shuttered, Lich and team turned to crypto. On-chain data shows the Convoy raised about 20 bitcoin (BTC), worth roughly $1.1 million at the time.Then the class action plaintiffs came across “considerable evidence about the plans to distribute the funds as soon as possible, in part to benefit the individual protestors, but also, to avoid any enforcement activity,” court documents state. That’s when the Mareva injunction was requested and granted.The injunction seems to have been partially successful, and a combination of crypto and cash totaling over $6 million was eventually transferred to a third-party escrow account and frozen until the conclusion of the class action, which is still ongoing as of this publication.Read more: 'Frozen' Bitcoin Tied to Canadian Protests Lands at Coinbase, Crypto.ComThe key word there is ""partially."" According to an article by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), police only managed to seize about 6 BTC out of the 20 BTC raised. Nevertheless, authorities seem confident they can track down and seize the remaining bitcoin, which seems to have been moved to ""hundreds of smaller wallets.""According to the article, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) claims ""it has the capability to seize and recover digital currency assets, pointing to past cases where the Crown successfully prosecuted crypto criminals.""Read more: Canada's Trudeau Enacts Emergencies Act, and Crypto Is IncludedOne key lesson Lich and her counterparts have taught us (albeit inadvertently) is that crypto is no longer some obscure asset immune to regulatory enforcement. The crypto community was reminded of this when the U.S. Treasury Department banned American citizens from using decentralized crypto-mixing service Tornado Cash in August.The second lesson is that, at least in Canada, not only can courts seize crypto as part of regulatory enforcement, but also as part of private litigation.UPDATE (Dec. 9, 21:30 UTC): The court granted the Mareva injunction but the story has been clarified to show that it was only successful in seizing a portion of the money. In addition, the authorities seized money, rather than freezing accounts. Corresponding changes have been made throughout the story, including the headline, sub headline and concluding two paragraphs.*All amounts are in Canadian dollars (CAD)",2022/12/05
223,"Circle, the company behind stablecoin USDC, has terminated its agreement with special-purpose acquisition company Concord Acquisition Corp., thereby stepping back from its plan to go public.The firm said on Monday that the board of both companies approved the move.The stablecoin issuer had announced plans to go public in July 2021, with a valuation of $4.5 billion. The valuation was later doubled when the firms amended their terms in February.In a Twitter post, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said his firm didn't complete the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's ""qualification in time.""""I believe that the SEC has been rigorous and thorough in understanding our business and many novel aspects of this industry,"" Allaire added. ""This kind of review is necessary to ultimately provide trust, transparency and accountability for major companies in crypto.""The firm also said that it turned profitable in the third quarter of this year and ended the quarter with almost $400 million in unrestricted cash.The termination follows similar high-profile crypto firms cancelling plans to go public via a SPAC, such as trading platform eToro in July and bitcoin miner PrimeBlock in August.SPACs have became a common means of companies going public in recent years, with the SEC reporting in March that they accounted for half of all initial public offerings in 2020-21.In March, the SEC said it would propose “specialized disclosure requirements with respect to, among other things, compensation paid to sponsors, conflicts of interest, dilution and the fairness of these business combination transactions,"" in a sign that such listings would be subjected to greater regulatory scrutiny.Read more: Circle CEO Calls for Clear US Laws on Stablecoins to 'Unleash' Their PotentialUPDATE (Dec. 5, 13:44 UTC): Adds additional background information.",2022/12/05
224,"Nic Carter, the venture capitalist, has been a fan of tungsten for years. He’s discussed the elemental metal in podcasts, has talked up its “incredible density” and even claims to have given out 1-inch tungsten cubes as holiday gifts. In 2019, he created a handy guide as to why it was “the best metal,” noting its electrical conductivity, malleability and resistance to oxidation.Carter’s fascination with the silvery, smooth alloy has certainly inspired others. Last December, crypto traders briefly caused a run on tungsten cubes and a minor price spike in metals markets. But the Castle Island Ventures co-founder would not call himself a tungsten supremacist. He’s also long talked up the benefits of gold, for instance.Yes, a man can love two metals. In fact, Carter taught many this year that a man does not even have to be blindly faithful to a single blockchain! This came as a bit of a shock to the so-called bitcoin maximalists, who believe there is one true cryptocurrency and who had once, mistakenly as it turns out, counted Carter among their ranks.Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022Backing up: In June, Carter took to Twitter to say his fund was “[e]xcited to be backing @dynamic_xyz!,” as a venture capitalist is wont to do. It didn’t take long for Maxis to realize that Dynamic was a startup building a product for wallets on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, not Bitcoin, and to begin criticizing Carter.Nic Carter, 30, a dual-citizen of the U.K. and U.S., who grew up in the Washington, D.C., area, has spent the majority of his professional life in the crypto industry. He founded the premier data firm Coin Metrics out of graduate school and was Fidelity Digital Assets’ first crypto analyst.By the time Carter, who has almost 350,000 followers on Twitter, founded his venture firm, which has committed hundreds of millions of dollars to funding crypto startups and raised three funds, he had begun to build a reputation as a bitcoiner. On Medium, Carter wrote long pieces covering arcane and philosophical issues about bitcoin. A particularly successful piece made predictions about what 2017 initial coin offerings (ICO) would fail (he wasn’t far off).But bitcoin wasn’t Carter’s only area of interest. One idea Carter was early to endorse, proof of reserves – the idea that crypto service providers could cryptographically show they hold the coins they’re supposed to – has become a major topic of conversation this year following the collapse of FTX.Read more: David Z. Morris – Nic Carter vs. The Bitcoin Maximalists“From the very start, I’ve been a pluralist when it comes to blockchains. Today, the only ‘base layer’ asset that I like from an investment perspective is Bitcoin, because I think its monetary and governance qualities are supreme, but that doesn’t mean I haven’t been interested in other trends in the blockchain space,” Carter wrote in a blog post this summer, following his flameout with Maxis.Carter, a regular CoinDesk contributor, is far from the only bitcoiner who has taken aim at the quasi-religion that has formed around the asset. Recent months have seen long-time bitcoin advocates and investors Udi Wertheimer and Eric Wall rail against the tribalism and monoculture that started forming around Bitcoin around the time of the “Blocksize Wars” in 2017.And then there’s the Bitcoin OGs including Erik Voorhees, Roger Ver and Jesse Powell who have embraced pluralism in crypto. Carter, for his part, has not become an uncritical advocate of “Web3,” but recognizes that some core technologies like non-fungible tokens or decentralized identity could be broadly useful one day.The schism between crypto and Bitcoin is rarely about actual tech. Over the years, maximalists have convinced themselves that bitcoin was digital cash, an inflation hedge and destined to become the global reserve currency. As each “narrative” is disproven, like the ignominious stock-to-flow model or halvening thesis, the views among a tiny sector only grow more extreme.These maximalists gladly called themselves “toxic.” Indeed, their worldview has become so twisted that some try to justify Bitcoin – a stateless monetary network – by claiming it’s the only “legal” cryptocurrency, and calling for federal regulators to shut down other crypto projects. Others have taken to promoting dangerous lifestyles like raw meat diets.Carter wrote he was “genuinely embarrassed to be associated” with the increasingly radical culture around bitcoin. He added most bitcoiners are normal and good people. And that’s why he is Most Influential, for taking a stand against the people giving bitcoiners a bad reputation.",2022/12/05
225,"Australian computer scientist Craig Wright has long claimed, and failed to conclusively prove, that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin.After being “doxxed” as Satoshi to the media in December 2015 – widely speculated to be a publicity stunt arranged by Wright and his associates – Wright kicked off a series of moves the following year intended to convince the public of his claims, including a private “signing session” with former Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen and a public blog post (the so-called “Sartre post”) purporting to use Satoshi’s private keys to sign a message.Both of these efforts were picked apart by cryptography experts and judged to be hoaxes intended to deceive the public.The criticism, however, did not stop Wright from continuing to claim he is Satoshi. Wright went on to create a new fork of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV), and developed a new method of convincing the world of his Satoshiness: attempting to sue anyone who says otherwise into financial oblivion.Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022This year, one of the people on the receiving end of Wright’s wealth and legal might was Magnus Granath, a Norwegian citizen better known by his online alias, Hodlonaut.After Hodlonaut posted a series of tweets in March 2019 calling Wright a “fraud” and a “scammer” and labeling him a “Faketoshi,” Wright sicced his legal team on the public school teacher, demanding he delete the tweets and declare Wright to be Satoshi.When Hodlonaut did not comply, Wright offered a bounty on his identity, doxxed him and filed a defamation lawsuit against him in the U.K. Granath filed his own lawsuit in his native Norway, asking a Norwegian judge to declare that his tweets were protected by the freedom of speech and preventing Wright from suing for damages in connection with the tweets.The resulting trial in Oslo was crypto’s own version of David vs. Goliath: Hodlonaut’s two lawyers – paid largely through crowdfunding efforts – faced off against Wright’s international team of nine, and emerged victorious.During his roughly three hours of testimony, Hodlonaut was composed and steadfast in his assertions that Wright was not Satoshi.“There was a consensus, and there still is a consensus,” he told the judge, “that Craig Wright is a fraud.”Hodlonaut told the court how Wright’s lawyers told him the suit could be dropped if only he agreed to delete his tweets – and tweet a pre-written statement saying he acknowledged Wright as Satoshi.“I can’t do that, I’m not willing to do that, because it is a lie,” Hodlonaut said of the settlement terms. “I’m not willing to be in any way part of continuing something that I believe to be a fraud.”On Oct. 20, Norwegian District Court Judge Helen Engebrigtsen ruled in favor of Granath, declaring that he “had sufficient factual grounds to claim that Wright had lied and cheated in his attempt to prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.”Hodlonaut’s legal victory is the latest in an ever-growing pile of verdicts that find that Wright has lied in court and presented falsified and manipulated evidence.Though Wright’s lawyers appealed the verdict in November, Hodlonaut’s willingness to stand up to a crypto bully who has time and time again used legal threats to silence his critics (as well as sue bitcoin developers and websites hosting the Bitcoin white paper) has struck a substantial blow and perhaps strengthened the resolve of others who have been silenced.However, Hodlonaut’s victory in Oslo has not stopped Wright from continuing to use the bully cudgel of the courts against his critics – and not everyone is willing or able to stand up to him like Hodlonaut.In filing his appeal in Oslo, Crypto’s Goliath may have stood back up, and only time will tell whether Hodlonaut will prevail a second time. But in fighting back, Hodlonaut is fighting for something precious to many in the crypto community – free speech – so he has a massive crowd cheering him on.",2022/12/05
226,"Jordan Fish, better known by his alter ego, Cobie, was co-hosting an episode of the much-loved podcast, “Up Only,” the Friday night FTX was hacked. The Crypto Twitter influencer had been talking with Zane Tackett, the company’s wealth management director turned whistleblower, about the insanity of watching a crypto exchange once valued at $32 billion become worthless in a matter of days.It had been a jarring week for crypto. FTX’s founder Sam Bankman-Fried was an industry posterboy, who just months ago seemed to have prevented a major contagion event by rescuing struggling firms like BlockFi and Voyager Digital. Now his empire was crumbling, his customers had lost billions of dollars and it didn’t seem like the situation could get any worse.But then things got worse. Cobie had received a direct message about a suspicious, late-night transaction moving funds out of the frozen FTX exchange. Several thousand viewers were watching the “Up Only” livestream, co-hosted by Brian Krogsgard (aka Ledger Status), which was popular from the day it launched during the better days of 2021.Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022Cobie, who has long, sandy-blond hair and speaks with an English lilt, shared information related to the attack in real time. It was a remarkable view into his information gathering, vetting and distributing process. A fixture of Crypto Twitter since 2013, the year he says he got interested in bitcoin, Cobie has become a practiced hand at calling out scams and unknotting convoluted crypto transactions.This April, for instance, Cobie sent out a series of tweets showing the signs of insider trading at major crypto exchange Coinbase. The exchange then followed up with an investigation that eventually implicated its former product manager, Ishan Wahi, who has since pleaded not guilty to insider trading charges and is next scheduled to appear in federal court on March 22, 2023.But that’s not the only time Cobie has used his considerable influence for good. Over the summer, after Crypto YouTuber Ben Armstrong (aka BitBoy) filed a lawsuit against another YouTuber who had called out Armstrong’s questionable practice of shilling shifty projects, Cobie rallied together a legal fund for the defendant – sending in $100,000 of his own money. BitBoy later dropped the case.With over 700,000 Twitter followers, Cobie’s has become one of the most-watched accounts. He shares useful news, validates worthwhile projects and calls out shifty behavior. His podcast regularly features crypto royalty such as Vitalik Buterin and Zooko Wilcox. While his income and crypto holdings are unknown, Cobie has gone independent as an “influencer” after working at U.K. neobank Monzo and touring as a semi-pro musician.And while he’s known as much for cracking jokes on Twitter, Cobie has also cultivated respect as a writer. In his SubStack this year, he covered serious topics ranging from broken tokenomics models to problems of decentralized voting.Cobie started off this year with a small rebrand, deciding to forgo his longstanding Twitter handle, CryptoCobain, and avatar, a picture of Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain with BTC-stylized glasses. He said the real Cobain, who committed suicide in 1994, would have appreciated the earlier, punkier days of Bitcoin, but crypto has changed.Cobie struck a similarly reflective note the night FTX was hacked. After a year of bankruptcy announcements, hacks, lawsuits, depressed markets, it seemed there was little else good left in the industry. At the end of a three-hour broadcast, Cobie and Ledger realized the FTX-sponsored “Up Only” likely needed a new backer. It could’ve been their last show.“What a stupid f**king industry,” Cobie said. But there he was the next morning, tweeting.",2022/12/05
227,"In a perfect world, crypto wouldn’t be influenced by fiat-based monetary policy, and Jerome Powell, chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, wouldn’t be one of the most influential people in the industry. But as proven by the latest crypto meltdown, Powell has driven the market narrative more often than not in 2022.Four-decade-high inflation has been the focus of economic policy leaders around the globe this year. That has been particularly true of Powell and his colleagues at the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body that has raised interest rates at a rapid pace since March, from near-zero levels to the current 3.5% to 4%.The economic uncertainty is one of many reasons crypto assets have suffered heavy losses this year. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest crypto by market capitalization, is down 65% year to date. On average, bitcoin moved 4% on days where the Fed raised interest rates.Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022The total value of crypto assets is 62% lower than at the beginning of the year, when the asset class was valued at $2.2 trillion.“Jerome Powell belongs on any list of cryptocurrency influencers given his position as chairman of the Federal Reserve,” said Howard Greenberg, educator at Prosper Trading Academy. “All financial markets, including cryptocurrencies, are impacted by the Fed's rate hikes.”The fact that cryptocurrencies are thus affected causes chagrin for the crypto industry’s biggest advocates. Bitcoin, because of its capped total, is supposed to be immune to inflation and any Federal Reserve action.For the first half of this year, before the crypto industry took a big hit from the failure of a number of crypto companies, including lender Celsius Network, Three Arrows Capital and most recently, FTX, bitcoin was directly correlated with both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 stock indexes, which are both strongly affected by inflation. According to traders, this was because institutional investors were increasingly buying bitcoin and trading it as they would stocks.Though the correlation has since weakened, macroeconomic uncertainty is likely persist into next year. Fed officials have signaled further rate hikes are coming in 2023. Dashing the hopes of bitcoin maximalists and crypto believers, Powell’s impact on crypto assets will continue.",2022/12/05
228,"Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, changed his stance on crypto during 2022, sending strong trust signals to the markets.Back in 2017, Fink said bitcoin was an “index of money laundering.” But in the summer of 2022, BlackRock, with $10 trillion under management, made two forays into bitcoin, further cementing the asset’s establishment as a mainstream investment.Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022The asset manager connected its Aladdin investment platform to Coinbase Prime, giving TradFi investors access to bitcoin, as prelude to expansion into other cryptocurrencies eventually.

However, the old-guard crypto community is apprehensive. What was envisioned as an anarchic financial technology is increasingly being co-opted by large institutions.

229,"The crypto industry has its fair share of supporters on Capitol Hill, but two of its most vocal proponents are senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).The bipartisan duo championed the crypto industry during the bull market, and right before the market crashed in June 2022 introduced a long-awaited bill – the Responsible Financial Innovation Act – that aims to establish comprehensive regulatory guidelines for the crypto industry.The bill, if passed, would favor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as the industry watchdog, and would make purchases under $200 tax-free – potentially paving the way for crypto to be used more like digital cash than digital gold.Lummis and Gillibrand are also working on another bill with Sen. Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.) on stablecoin regulations that could be introduced as early as this year. The bill would compete with alternative bipartisan legislation being drafted in the House Financial Services Committee.Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022Lummis in particular has been a long-time fan of bitcoin. She told CoinDesk she first bought bitcoin in 2013, when the price was around $320, and has never sold it. Public records indicate the senator holds between $100,000 and $350,000 worth of the cryptocurrency.Lummis has made it her personal mission to educate her fellow senators about crypto, spinning up the Financial Innovation Caucus with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Arizona) earlier this year to bring in speakers to educate lawmakers at the staff level.Though Gillibrand has been less outspoken about crypto than Lummis, Fortune declared her constituent state of New York the “center of crypto startups,” with $6.5 billion invested at the beginning of this year. She has signed onto other pieces of crypto-friendly legislation as well, including the other major effort in the Senate to regulate the crypto industry – senators. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and John Boozman’s (R-Ark.) Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA).Gillibrand and Lummis’ support for the crypto industry has earned them many supporters (and donors). Among them is now-disgraced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who donated $40 million to Democratic candidates ahead of the November midterm elections. (Ryan Salame, co-CEO with Bankman-Fried of FTX Digital Markets, was a major Republican donor – a fact that has been lost in many of the reports on FTX’s political contributions.)Gillibrand was a recipient of at least $16,600 from Bankman-Fried, and has tried to wash her hands of him by promising to donate the money to charity.Lummis has also cited FTX’s collapse as evidence that more regulation is needed, and has said she plans to push ahead with the Responsible FInancial Innovation Act.“Transparent and fair exchange regulation … is essential to ensuring customers are protected while still promoting responsible innovation,” Lummis said.The collapse of FTX has also prompted many of Lummis and Gillibrand’s fellow senators, including long-time crypto skeptics including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), to call for urgent regulations to prevent further contamination and future collapses.Though Lummis and Gillibrand are continuing to work on crypto-related policy, their crypto cheering – so loud and consistent during the bull market – has gotten a lot quieter.",2022/12/05
230,"Punk6529 is living the future, today. At least, the future as the pseudonymous non-fungible token collector imagines it to be – where everyone has a digital avatar that slips into the metaverse as easily as a bird flies through the air.“Here I am running around as a cartoon Punk, very seamlessly participating in communities and societies like I live in the physical world,” he told CoinDesk in an interview. Just “participating” in the metaverse is selling himself short, considering the work Punk6529 does advocating for, writing about and building this new digital frontier.This year, Punk6529, who takes his name from an eponymous CryptoPunk NFT, unveiled his own NFT fund, NFT museum and started work on what he calls the Open Metaverse, a blueprint for an online city. However, most would probably know him by his often-long Twitter threads spelling out the need for crypto, sent out to his nearly half-million followers.Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022“We must ensure we take the pathway towards an open, interoperable future now,” he said. If that sounds like something a cypherpunk would say, Punk6529 wouldn’t disagree. In addition to being among the most savvy NFT collectors, he has built a reputation as a leading futurist, having spoken with Raoul Pal, Laura Shin and other luminaries on podcasts (often using a voice modulator).Like many other early bitcoin adopters, Punk6529 has a background in tech and finance that informs his views on those subjects today and the importance of crypto. He believes the world is on a “path dependence” to “persistent digital objects” or, in other words, is increasingly going digital.“Whatever ends up being the standard platform or API [for the metaverse] is going to end up being very important in a decade. If it’s a Facebook API or Apple API, it's going to be the same type of scenario that exists today,” he said. Although Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the metaverse his company is building will be interoperable, there’s reason to doubt that.To this end, Punk6529 has been self-funding a number of projects in an attempt to onboard people into a crypto-based metaverse. In April, he launched the free-to-roam museum district of his Open Metaverse, containing what he called “the most high-end art NFTs ever displayed in one place.” His stated goal is to get “​​100,000,000 people to use an NFT.”It’s a digital environment that can be scaled up, and that other people can build in, without anyone controlling it. Although Punk6529 has called this an “investment in the public,” he also believes that NFTs can one day be an “$80 trillion” category, if all “intangible goods” move onto the blockchain.Punk6529 currently owns over 850 NFTs, according to his OpenSea bio. But that isn’t counting his museum wallet with hundreds more. Prices have since decreased, but Punk’s known holdings were valued as high as $20 million this year.Not much is known about Punk6529’s IRL alter ego other than the small details he chooses to reveal. He apparently lived in downtown New York City, not far from Tompkins Square Park, for years, and used to consider himself a bitcoin maximalist. Although he wants to keep his metaverse avatar separate, he admits the glasses, the hoodie and the scruffy beard sported by CryptoPunk 6529 aren’t far off.“There’s a reason I didn’t choose a Mohawk Punk with a gold chain,” he said. “This is nerd-ville central.”",2022/12/05
231,"In October, the European Union finalized the text of its landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework – but not without a significant push from European Commissioner Mairead McGuinness, who is responsible for financial services, financial stability and the Capital Markets Union.The sweeping rules that would apply to crypto service providers and digital asset issuers looking to operate in the 27 member states of the trade bloc were introduced in 2020 by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm responsible for proposing new legislation. As the senior-most EU official for financial services, McGuinness deftly pushed the framework through the bloc’s complex legislative process before finalization. German lawmaker Stefan Berger saw the progression of the bill (procedurally and in terms of content) through the European Parliament.“The EU is one of the first major jurisdictions worldwide to design a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto-assets. MiCA will protect consumers, market integrity and financial stability. It will bring crypto-asset exchanges, wallet providers or issuers of crypto-assets under EU supervision,” the Commission said in an email to CoinDesk.Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022MiCA was originally inspired by the now-defunct Libra (later Diem) project by Facebook (now Meta) that sought to create a stablecoin – which is a digital currency stabilized against the value of other assets – that regulators feared could threaten nations’ sovereignty. But as it moved through the EU’s legislative process, the bill took on new life. It is now hailed as a standard-setting rulebook for crypto regulations on a global scale.McGuinness called for a global agreement for regulating crypto with the aim of protecting investors earlier this year. In October, she called on the U.S. to create its own crypto rules.She has also said she wants to ensure ""no product remains unregulated."" Although MiCA covers most crypto assets, it left some ambiguity on how to treat non-fungible tokens (NFT), something the Commission says it would address in follow-up regulation to MiCA should lawmakers request it.When concerns arose about crypto being used to evade sanctions in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, McGuinness urged EU lawmakers to speed up and finalize MiCA.“What I want, and what I can tell you, [is] that MiCA rules will be the right tool to address the concerns on consumer protection, market integrity and financial stability. This is something that is so urgent given recent developments,” McGuinness said at the time.The dramatic collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX in November has sent shockwaves through the entire industry, and regulators have mobilized with fresh vigor to clamp down on the space. Commenting on the crash, McGuinness said the notion that crypto can exist without regulation is “a science fiction idea.”“Because money, if it's not regulated properly, as we know, can do horrible damage,” McGuinness said while speaking at a forum on Nov. 24.The EU, thanks to MiCA, remains quite at ease in the wake of the FTX debacle, at least according to Berger, who says the strict standards set by the framework could have prevented such a collapse.“If FTX had MiCA regulation, the present day would be completely different. So, for me, it's obvious the [MiCA rules work] as a bulwark against developments [that] led to this Lehman moment – and FTX was a Lehman moment – for the crypto world,” Berger said during a conference in November.Berger, who steered the bill through attempts by lawmakers to add provisions that could have effectively banned energy-intensive crypto the bitcoin in the EU, was also instrumental in MiCA’s finalization this year.Until the framework comes into effect in 2024, there’s really no saying how it would block such instances in practice, especially with companies like FTX that were set up in the Bahamas – well outside the EU’s jurisdiction.EU lawmakers are set to vote on MiCA in February 2023.",2022/12/05

These discontiguous outposts would be stitched together into a “network archipelago” using “mixed reality,” a combination of virtual reality, augmented reality (e.g., glasses that superimpose text or graphics over what’s in front of your nose) and face-to-face interactions. Digital IDs would confer citizenship and a census would be taken (how else?) on-chain. Ultimately, a network state would seek diplomatic recognition from the analog-world governments Srinivasan depicts as sclerotic.Some readers may be thinking, “What is this man smoking?” But there are at least two projects, Praxis Society and Afropolitan, trying to make this apparent sci-fi dream into a reality. (Srinivasan is an investor in both.)Read more: Balaji Srinivasan, the Man Who Called COVID (2020)In 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic put much of the world on lockdown, Afropolitan formed an online community of 200,000 people in less than six months, according to co-founder Chika Uwazie. (They initially convened on Clubhouse, the voice-based social network that was briefly popular before Twitter Spaces ate its lunch.) The group raised “millions of dollars” in bitcoin and fiat currency from members of the diaspora of Nigerians living in the U.S., Europe and Latin America, Uwazie said during a presentation in October at CoinDesk’s I.D.E.A.S. conference in New York. (The group supplemented that with a $2.1 million pre-seed round this year from Srinivasan and other angel investors.)A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), Afropolitan aspires to build “a pan-African network state to help 1 billion Africans live their most abundant lives,” something it says the world’s nation-states have failed to do. But during her talk, Uwazie tailored her message to the investor crowd.Unlike a social network, which needs millions of users to turn a profit, a network state could produce a return to investors with only a few hundred thousand members, Uwazie claimed. Revenue would come from “physical and e-resident taxes,” according to one of her slides.“The network state is its own emerging asset,” she said. “It actually could be quite profitable.”If nothing else, Srinivasan’s book is sparking conversations. As of mid-November, “The Network State” ranked third among Amazon’s bestsellers in the general technology and reference category, fourth in political philosophy ebooks and 16th in political philosophy books overall.",2022/12/05
234,"An NFT of this image was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.The headlines are brutal. They’re funny. They almost look fake. Just a few examples: “’Women-led’ NFT project, ‘Fame Lady Squad,’ turns out to be a bunch of dudes”; “Crypto.com wants back the $7.2 million they accidentally sent a customer last year”; “Bill Murray's NFT charity auction nets $185,000, which is then immediately stolen”; “CoinDesk reports that Decentraland has just 38 daily active users.”The headlines come from Web3IsGoingJustGreat, a blog that chronicles the many scams, hacks, hiccups, rug pulls, missteps and cringe of crypto and blockchain. “There are these enormous promises being made by people in the industry, of how Web3 is the future of finance and will solve every little problem” says Molly White, the 29-year-old software engineer and longtime Wikipedia editor who created and runs the site. She argues that Web3 boosters promise the future but ignore the present, that they’re “writing checks they can’t cash, and in the meantime a lot of people are taking the fall.”Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022White is hardly the first crypto critic. Bitcoin is “fool’s gold and anybody buying it is ultimately a fool,” said longtime crypto antagonist Peter Schiff. Non-fungible tokens are “100% based on greater fool theory,” said Bill Gates. Bitcoin is “probably rat poison squared,” said Warren Buffett. The space is a “house of cards crypto cesspool,” tweeted the economist Nouriel “Dr. Doom” Roubini, who added a poop emoji.Most of these critiques boil down to “it’s all a Ponzi scheme” or “it’s all going to zero.” But the space has evolved and so have its critics. “The skeptical space has changed quite a bit,” says Cas Piancey, co-host of the “Crypto Critics’ Corner” podcast. Piancey says that he and his co-host Bennett Tomlin see the space “mostly as a scam” but that “we are open to the idea that there’s something valuable there. How valuable, we don’t know.”White, Piancey and the actor-turned-investigator Ben McKenzie are part of a new generation of crypto skeptics. More nuanced. Hyper specific. Fluent in the tech and the memes and the vibes.From an intellectual perspective, sure, White finds much of the space interesting. She’s a software engineer, after all – she geeks out on tech. “One thing I think is important is to separate the interesting from the possible use cases,” she says. “There’s a lot of stuff that’s really interesting.” From an academic perspective, for example, she’s fascinated by the innovation with ZK (zero-knowledge) proofs, but “that doesn’t necessarily mean that it will be world changing, or that the positive aspects of it will outweigh the negatives.”Just over a year ago almost no one in the crypto space had heard of Molly White. Now she’s serving on White House crypto panels, giving a speech (“Is Web3 bulls**t?”) to a packed crowd at Web Summit, shares commentary in mainstream news outlets (from The Verge to Vox, to Fast Company). As the Washington Post put it in a glowing profile, she’s “fast becoming the cryptocurrency world’s biggest critic.”And now with the meltdown of FTX, the icy panic of crypto winter and the latest drumbeat of crypto is dead, Molly White and the skeptics are having their moment.It all started with a unicycle.In 2006, 13-year-old White enjoyed riding unicycles. She now describes it as one of her “really weird hobbies;” others would include creating Twitter Bots – like one that automatically added the word “cyber” to random nouns in headlines, making it sound like an uninformed tech journalist.White, like any normal online-savvy teen, looked up the Wikipedia page on unicycles. She found the page lacking. So unlike every other 13-year-old, she edited the page and fleshed it out. That was fun. What other pages could she edit? Soon she edited articles for bands like Disturbed, Evanescence and other emo rock.Soon she faced a problem that every writer dreads. “I kind of ran out of things to write about pretty quickly,” she says with a laugh. Emo-rock knowledge would only take her so far. How else could she contribute? “I realized there was this whole group of people who weren’t just editing the things they liked, but maintaining the website as a whole.” They copy edited. They cleaned up entries. They even fought Wiki-vandalism, like when political extremist groups would attack pages with spam and fake edits.What started as a lark turned into a passion. “As time went on I realized how important it is to have high-quality information available to people for free,” says White. You didn’t need to spend hundreds of dollars for an Encyclopedia Britannica. You didn’t need to live near a library. All you needed was the internet. “This feels so critical to sort of moving the world forward,” she says.White became a Wikipedia site administrator in 2010, while still in high school. She spent six years (non-consecutive) on the site’s arbitration committee – effectively Wikipedia’s Supreme Court. She kept editing Wikipedia while working as a software engineer for HubSpot. Eventually, she left the charm of unicycles for editing the grislier pages on incels, the far right and gender-based extremist groups.“Those guys do not appreciate my work, and are very vocal about it,” she says, again with a soft laugh. But with extremist groups there’s very little that’s funny. She says one “particularly persistent sort of stalker type” published her address, tried to publish her family’s address, sent her information to the Proud Boys extremist group and even threatened to send someone to her apartment posing as a hopeful renter, who would then take videos from inside her home – just “crazy, unhinged stuff.”She kept editing the pages. In total White has edited 100,000 Wikipedia articles, although she’s quick to point out this estimate is hard to quantify and “not really meaningful” because sometimes a simple click of “revert to prior version” can count as an edit.Whether it’s 100,000 articles or 10,000, all of the years editing Wikipedia taught her a few things. She learned to appreciate open-source communities and how to evaluate media with skepticism, honing what she calls good “[crap] detection skills.” And in late 2021, White came across a term that needed a Wikipedia article. A term that had no clear definition. A term that was widely used but perhaps not widely understood: Web3.Editing the page for Web3 was not White’s first exposure to crypto. In the early 2010s, when still a teenager, she learned about bitcoin – then in its infancy – and even explained it to her family. She found much of it appealing. “It had a great online community, and a strong group of privacy advocates,” she says now. She didn’t consider buying any because “I wasn’t trying to buy drugs online, and that was the big use case.” As a teenager she didn’t happen to have random stacks of money sitting around for crypto speculation. But she remembers thinking, “Okay, cool, I love the idea of [bitcoin] funding whistleblowers.”Fast forward to 2021. White took another look at crypto and was startled by what she found. “I thought, how did we get from bitcoin funding dissidents to celebrities buying Bored Apes? What just happened?”So she would research what happened. White did what she has done for her entire adult life – she tried to track down sources, investigate and gain command of the subject. Except Web3 sources were tough to find. She scrolled through an endless stream of press releases that, as she describes it, were all about “this huge potential for Web3 and how you should definitely pay attention to it” but “never would say what Web3 actually was. You couldn’t just get a two-sentence description.”White’s first tweet that mentioned Web3 came on Nov. 10, 2021: “wrote a whole wikipedia article on web3 last night and i still don't think i know what it is.” So she kept investigating, kept reading, kept marveling at the absurdity – the projects she thinks of as “just bonkers,” where “people were doing the weirdest stuff with blockchain.”Take, for example, a blockchain project called “Realms of Ruin,” where a group of bestselling Young Adult fiction authors would create an imaginary universe – they’d establish the setting and characters – and fans would write fiction to contribute to this world. The fans could mint these stories as NFTs, and buy and trade NFT character artwork.There were many questions about the project. Who will own the intellectual property of these kids’ stories? Are the fans being paid for their work? “I remember seeing that and being like, “They’re trying to get kids to buy NFTs,’ says White. It seemed crazy. Most fans of YA, almost by definition, are young adults. They’re not 18. The whole idea struck her as poorly thought out, and likely a cash grab. Realms of Ruin was not long for the world – within five hours of going public the project was scrapped. (Part of this was because of an outcry over NFTs’ environmental impact; CoinDesk’s Cheyenne Ligon offers an alternate take.)White acknowledges that the intentions of the project could be innocent, but argues that good intentions are not enough. For her, that’s a global theme in crypto. “I think there are a lot of people who are running these crypto projects who genuinely believe in what they’re trying to do, and have good intentions around empowering artists,” says White. “But I also think that it’s really important to pay attention to the impact, as well as the intention.” In the case of Realms of Ruin, she says, you have to make sure that “you’re not just ripping off these kids.”The more White explored the space, the more projects she found that seemed misguided, goofy, grifty, predatory or somehow likely to cause harm. And it felt like there was no one publication or website that captured all of the collateral damage in one place. Most mainstream and crypto publications, says White, tend to mostly cover the “good” side of the crypto coin.Enter Web3isgoinggreat. She started the site as one of her many “dumb hobby projects” that she does for kicks, like the time in college when, during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, whenever she read articles about Hillary Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine, her mind would first see this as Clinton and Kanye, as in Kanye West. This amused her. So she wrote a script that changed Kaine to Kanye, a joke that has aged either poorly or gloriously.White didn’t think Web3isgoinggreat would get much traffic. But the site quickly found eyeballs and traction from HackerNews and “Buttcoin,” a crypto skeptic subreddit. People began to notice.The site is funny and droll, almost a throwback to early Gawker and the 2008-ish era of blogs. At first she tried to write it in her neutral Wikipedia-editor voice, but the jokes just came too easily. “Some of the stuff is so stupid,” she says, “and you just can’t help but laugh.”White has a film critic’s gift for spotting a target and dryly, without mercy, ripping it to pieces. “An up-and-coming crypto scam – er, project – has managed to dunk on crypto bros better than any satirist i've seen so far, with one of the most painful-to-watch youtube videos i've seen in a while. join me in hell as we watch this together,” she tweeted on Jan. 4, 2022, beginning a thread that gleefully mocked the project “Crypto Land.”The thread went viral. It put her on the crypto radar – as did Web3isgoinggreat’s cameo in Dan Olson’s “Line Goes Up – The Problem With NFTs” two-hour video, which now has 9 million views and counting. Her site (and her tweets) became must-read media for many in the space.A self-described introvert, at first White was reluctant to speak to journalists, appear on podcasts or speak at conventions. In 2022, when the White House asked her to be part of a panel on cryptocurrency, her first reaction was, “What? I’m a software engineer who just makes jokes about crypto in her spare time.”Eventually, she began saying yes. She said yes to giving a lecture at Stanford on Abuse on the Blockchain. Yes to appearing on podcasts. Yes to the White House. (This stemmed from President Biden’s Executive Order to research crypto; White was asked to give a statement to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which she published here.) 2022 would be the year of yes.The reason for White’s change of heart? She had a realization. “It felt like so many people in crypto were speaking so confidently about things that they know nothing about,” she says. “Well, I know at least as much about this as they do.”If a critic says, “Crypto is all a Ponzi scheme” or “crypto is all a scam,” this is relatively easy to refute. One counterexample is enough to do the trick. Oh, so crypto is all a scam? Tell that to the Ukrainian troops who received immediate global fundraising thanks to crypto.What makes the critiques of White, Piancey, and the other skeptics so effective is they acknowledge the occasional use cases, they understand the tech, they have taken the time to research the space and, after all of their analysis, they believe, on balance – in the real world of today (as opposed to the Web3-powered utopia of tomorrow) – the bad outweighs the good.“The experiment of bitcoin is really cool,” says Cas Piancey. “There’s nothing to argue about that. I love the idea of a non-nationalized currency.” And Piancey says there can be the occasional use for cryptocurrency, such as a Chinese dissident receiving funds that are censorship resistant. Yet, how common is this? “That’s a niche use case,” says Piancey, “but the reality is that it’s not something that’s going to dominate the world.”This is a similar worldview to one held by Jacob Silverman, a longtime tech reporter and fellow crypto skeptic. “I’m not on a mission to burn it all down. I don’t have an activist mission,” says Silverman. In August 2021, Silverman received a random direct message from the actor Ben McKenzie (of “The OC” fame), asking if he wanted to talk about crypto. “He jokes now that he slid into my DMs,” says Silverman.They met for beers and burgers. They clicked. They talked about the problems with crypto, they swapped ideas, they traveled to conferences together, they did research, and then they sold the book “Easy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud,” slated for a July 2023 release. In a description that crypto bulls will find chilling or dismiss as FUD, the book promises an exposé that “points in shock to the climactic final days of cryptocurrency now upon us.” (Especially in the wake of FTX, McKenzie has taken a flamethrower to Crypto Twitter. “If you think FTX is the worst/biggest fraud in crypto, I have bad news for you,” he tweeted. Good luck to the players remaining at the table.”)FTX is now an easy (if perfectly appropriate) target. And although White and I happen to speak during the implosion of FTX, for an example of Web3 going sideways she points to something less obvious: Axie Infinity. On the surface, sure, there’s the $620 million hack, which might have involved the North Korean government. But look deeper. “The project itself is a good example of how crypto incentives are often really twisted,” she says. Axie Infinity was the poster child of the “play-to-earn” game, which White admits is an attractive concept – you gobble up crypto rewards for doing something you already enjoy. This is a fine theory. (It’s a theory I’ve written about, repeatedly.)Then Axie took a darker turn when people tried to squeeze as much alpha as possible from the project, effectively loaning capital to groups of low-wage workers in places like the Philippines and Venezuela. (The cartoon blobs could cost $300 or more.) So in White’s view the loaners of capital, more or less, became landlords exploiting people – often in poor working conditions – who were grinding out the game. “This is certainly a far cry from the idea of a fun game you play after work, and also making a few bucks,” says White. She suspects that even without a hack the game would have cratered because “the whole economical model is completely unsustainable. There was no actual value being created by [people] battling Pokemon.”Okay, so maybe NFT play-to-earn isn’t her jam, but what about NFTs in general? Can’t they have merit? Don’t they empower artists? (I’ve long viewed this as a win for crypto.) White is happy to see creators monetize their work, but argues that this has very little to do with blockchain, decentralization or breakthroughs in technology. “The revolution here is not the tech,” she says. “The real change is the speculative bubble that emerged around it.” From this perspective, artists are “empowered” because a cadre of millionaires became billionaires and the froth has trickled down.NFT advocates have a comeback: But there is a technological breakthrough. Now, thanks to blockchain, for the first time, people can truly prove ownership of digital assets. This allows for digital scarcity. This fundamentally changes the online game.White has a quick comeback to the comeback: “The technologically interesting thing [about NFTs] is not the cryptocurrency, it’s the cryptography,” she says. “That’s something that we can do for decades.” In one of many essays, she laid out the technological steps – using something called PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption – for an artist to sell unique digital goods without using blockchain. The tech has been there all along. No artists have been using this tech, says White, because there has “never been a speculative market.” When the hype around NFTs dies down, she suspects the markets will dry up.Part of White’s exasperation is that many in the space view blockchain as a solution for every problem, and seem ignorant of all the work that had come before crypto. Take decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). “A lot of them are saying that, for the first time, now we’re going to be an online self-governing community, unlike everything else on the internet,” White says with a laugh. “Well, no. That’s not really true.” She found this particularly amusing given her 15 years with Wikipedia, a highly functioning (if imperfect) online, decentralized, self-governing community.Don’t get her started on the Web3 projects that try to make a “better Wikipedia,” but with crypto. “Those projects have hilariously failed in several different instances,” she says. To her it smacks of hubris. While the idea was to pay people with tokens to edit – seems reasonable – this creates what White argues is a flawed incentive model. One incentive is to create high-quality information. Another incentive is to make as many edits as possible so you can rack up more tokens. “Those two things are not aligned,” she says.Sure, maybe you can cleverly tweak the incentives towards some kind of voting model, but even that will eventually get gamed, says White, in a kind of “I’ll vote for your spam edit if you vote for my spam edit.” In yet another viral Twitter thread, she excoriated “Golden,” a prominent Wikipedia-but-with-crypto project, noting that “70% of the article on ‘Dog’ is dedicated to the Shiba Inu,” and that “there is no article on carrots, the vegetable. There are, however, articles about many different companies and cryptocurrencies with that name.”The crypto community, of course, has a classic defense for most of these arguments. It’s still early. Blockchain is in the early 1990s days of the internet. “I got so tired of that argument,” White says, and has two rebuttals: “One is that it’s premised on the argument that blockchains are equivalent to the internet in some way, that they’re similarly revolutionary.” The internet was clearly transformative to nearly every slice of culture; why should we presume that Web3 will have the same sweeping impact, and therefore allow the same leisurely timeline?Her second response: It’s flawed to apply the developmental time frame from an early tech to a later generation tech. Take computers and the internet. It took decades to develop the transistors, CPUs and hardware that would lead to modern computers. By some accounts, the invention of the computer dates back to the 1830s and Charles Babbage, a British mathematician, who devised plans for an “Analytical Engine.”Progress begets progress. The internet developed faster than the computer because no one had to reinvent laptops. Blockchain should develop even faster. “Every technology basically develops exponentially quicker than the one before it,” she says, and expands the argument in an essay “It’s not still the early days.” Or as Silverman puts it, “Crypto has been around for 13 years, almost as long as the iPhone.”Whether you agree with Molly White or not – and I, personally, confess to more optimism for the space – you can benefit from exposure to her arguments. Debate is healthy. And skepticism is a core ingredient for intellectual honesty. Skepticism is good for the individual and, I would argue, good for the industry at large.“You need skeptics,” says Piancey. “You need people to head-check you.” He estimates that the majority of his podcast’s subscribers are bullish on crypto, and they’re listening to understand and appreciate the other side.We’ve been hearing, for years, that “crypto is the future.” That might still be true. But ultimately, says White, we need to “temper these really optimistic visions of the future with how the technology is functioning today.”And in 2022, whether people liked it or not, the skeptics delivered that temperance.",2022/12/05
235,"An NFT of this work was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.On Erick Calderon’s LinkedIn page, he is still listed as the president of La Nova Tile Importers, a “family owned and operated porcelain and ceramic tile and slab importer.” In many ways Calderon is still in the business of tiles, but these days the expression of creativity is code, not clay, and the designs are not in kitchens or offices but in crypto wallets and hanging in virtual galleries in the metaverse.In 2022, Calderon’s company, Art Blocks, firmly established blockchain-based generative art as a significant and important new creative movement. With traditional and new collectors accounting for over $172 million in primary sales so far this year, and with showings in some of the top auction houses and galleries in the world, generative art is having a serious moment. Additionally, many of the top Art Blocks projects have defied the macro trend of non-fungible tokens (NFT) underperforming and declining in cost. Art Blocks drops in 2022 have been some of the best investments in the NFT ecosystem, while profile picture (PFP) projects including Bored Ape Yacht Club, Doodles and Moonbirds have seen their floor prices drop from recent highs.Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022Erick “Snowfro” Calderon has put in the hours to make Art Blocks work. Calderon began coding at the age of seven and has had entrepreneurial aspirations since college. His artist handle, Snowfro, was originally given to him by a college friend based both on his signature hair style and because he was starting a Snow Cone enterprise at the University of Texas that became SnowFro Refreshments. While working in his tile business, Calderon started getting into the blockchain, first with Bitcoin and then with Ethereum, where he started teaching himself to write smart contracts.In 2017, after seeing a post on Reddit about a new project called CryptoPunks, he started to mint Punks – a lot of Punks. As he explored all of the rarity traits behind the pixelated 24-inch-by-24-inch pixel portraits and how smart contracts enabled both the creator as well as the person minting the work to have participation in their output, the idea for Art Blocks was born.For those new to non-fungible tokens (NFT) you should know that Art Blocks, the company Calderon founded and where he serves as CEO, is a pretty big deal. Total sales on Art Blocks artwork have been more than $1.4 billion on primary and secondary markets, and it has been at the epicenter of the recent generative art movement. Generative art is produced by an algorithm. While the shapes, style and palette are determined by the artists, the outputs have randomness built in; unpredictability is what makes each version unique.While generative art has been around for decades, the Art Blocks platform allows creative coders to have a place to mint and sell their creations directly to collectors and the audience has grown significantly since it launched two years ago.Snowfro is one of the most popular artists on the Art Blocks platform. To buy one of his 9,700 unique Chromie Squiggles at current prices would cost around $15,000 for a common one. In September 2021 a collector paid almost $3 million for Chromie Squiggle #4697, which has very rare traits. Not a bad return on investment for the collector who initially minted the piece for 0.035 ETH, about $23 at the time. Snowfro is not the only artist from Art Blocks whose work sold for giant sums. Dmitri Cherniak’s Ringers #109 sold for $7 million inOctober while a number of Tyler Hobbs’ Fidenza series fetched more than seven figures.When asked why generative art has found such a fan base among the crypto crowd, Calderon is both humble and a bit surprised, “I didn’t expect it to be so native, it was such a niche thing. It was hard to envision this product market fit or this distribution mechanism that we’re seeing where an artist can sell something to 1,000 people in five minutes and they are all unique. I didn’t expect that level of demand.” Calderon said, “It wasn’t until 100,000 smart contract tokens were minted that I was like, oh yeah, it might be the most compatible form of art on the blockchain.”Much of the NFT conversation in 2022 has centered around artist royalties and whether platforms should allow buyers to avoid them, Art Blocks and Calderon are firmly on the side of the artist. “It’s been really wonderful to see this distribution mechanism for artists to be found,” he said. “We have a community of artists that are thriving and get to quit their jobs and pursue art full time, and you have these collectors that sell art and can profit based on the quality of their eye.” Art Blocks has earned over $82 million in royalties for artists to date, second only to Yuga Labs.What excites Calderon going into 2023? He hopes to continue the mission of creating a marketplace where artists and collectors can connect. “No guarantees what the future holds,” Calderon said, “but it seems that art can be a little more untethered from the typical crypto macro. It was beautiful to see that we have already been untethered from the crypto macro and what led us there was having a very firm vision of what we want which is to sell art, support artists and engage collectors in a way that this technology enables and enables very very well.”In addition, Art Blocks has introduced Art Blocks Engine, essentially a white-labeled back-end that allows creators, partners and brands to use NFTs as a way to connect deeper with their communities.Disclosure: The author has held a Chromie Squiggle in a crypto wallet since 2021.",2022/12/05
236,"“I never thought it could be as terrible as it is now. Virtually every aspect of my life is broken or destroyed.”After three months in a Dutch jail, web developer Alexey Pertsev still doesn’t fully know what he’s accused of doing. Those who ordered his arrest in August had published little more than a press release by way of explanation.“To me, it's more like they don't have to explain anything, they're just doing me a favor” in showing him legal documents for his case, Pertsev said of his Kafkaesque ordeal, in a statement given to CoinDesk early in November. “It doesn’t look like I’m here by any law.”Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022Together with Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, Pertsev is caught up in the case of Tornado Cash: a maelstrom that, in 2022, blew crypto apart, raising questions about its founding principles of privacy, freedom and open-source collaboration.The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) may not have realized what it was getting into when, two days before Pertsev’s arrest, it sanctioned the Tornado protocol, the most widely used currency mixer on the Ethereum blockchain, citing the laundering of billions of dollars.Immune from control by any one developer, Tornado is “unstoppable,” Semenov, who founded the protocol with Storm, told CoinDesk in a January interview. That didn’t stop regulators from trying.Tornado lets users tip money into a central pool, later drawing it out using a zero-knowledge proof – a sort of receipt offering access to funds without revealing extraneous details. That anonymity can be used for good or ill. OFAC says Tornado was used by North Korea-sponsored hackers, the Lazarus Group. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said he sent anonymous funds to aid Ukraine using it.OFAC wanted to act against a tool that, it says, has been used to launder criminal money and fund weapons of mass destruction in North Korea – a country that’s hardly a poster child for crypto’s libertarian ideals. But regulators, tired of playing and losing at wallet whack-a-mole, caused significant collateral damage when they tried to take on the whole system.Americans using the protocol lost access to funds and to other crypto applications and, though not personally sanctioned in the Aug. 8 measures, Semenov was soon tweeting he’d lost his account on Github, the site where open-source developers post their work. He asked if writing code was now illegal and later spoke of a “chilling effect” that made it taboo to talk about privacy at all.Sanctions normally target people like Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, or terrorists like Al-Qaeda; now it was blocking Americans from using a piece of software. Previous shutdowns, such as Blender.io in May, focused on those controlling a centralized mixer, but in 2020 Semenov and Storm destroyed their keys so Tornado works automatically. If nobody’s in charge, there’s nobody to blame.OFAC, which declined to be interviewed by CoinDesk, has said it has the power to sanction a wide range of entities like associations, groups and other organizations, including Tornado Cash. For Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at think tank Coin Center, the unprecedented measure is “conceptually incoherent.”“Sanctions are a tool for behavioral change,” Van Valkenburgh said. “Software in the abstract cannot change its behavior, it's just there.”Coin Center is now suing OFAC for infringing the constitutional right to make private political donations, and Van Valkenburgh points to the many other absurdities the case has raised.In one stunt this summer, celebrities including Shaquille O’Neal and Jimmy Fallon were sent funds from Tornado; the law says they are tainted by something they were powerless to prevent. Protocols can’t raise a legal petition – though that’s the normal route to get sanctions lifted. At one point, cryptography professors weren’t even sure if they were allowed to share code with students.In the Netherlands, there were more than Github accounts under threat. Pertsev’s detention drew an outcry from the crypto world; Edward Snowden recently contrasted the detention “for the ‘crime’ of building privacy tools to protect you” with the kid glove regulatory service afforded to executives at failed crypto exchange FTX.At a November hearing, the issue was painted by the Netherlands government as a clear case of money laundering. Far from being decentralized and automatic, Pertsev, Semenov and Storm ran the ecosystem like a business, the public prosecutor said. Pertsev’s lawyers, meanwhile, say the courts just don’t understand crypto, and are confusing Tornado with a centralized bitcoin mixer.Maybe that level of education will improve as judges pore over the details of how Tornado’s supposedly decentralized governance structure worked. In the meantime, there has been a great personal cost.“Imagine not seeing your loved one for months or years,” Pertsev told CoinDesk. To attend their weekly, one-hour supervised visit, his wife Xenia Malik must drive three hours in a borrowed car after his own was seized by the police, he said.“I have never seen her cry so often,” he said, in a written statement given to CoinDesk by Malik.Pertsev’s requests for bail, and to spend Christmas at home, were rejected on the basis that he could interfere with the investigation or try to flee – though he says he has little interest in returning to Russia, where he could face the draft.As to the idea he could perpetrate his crime again if released, he said, “I was not even informed of what crime,” in remarks made before his hearing.At an August demonstration against the arrest, developers said they are worried they’ll now be held liable for bad actors using their code. “Privacy is normal, it's not a crime,” protest organizer Eleonore Blanc told CoinDesk. Being free of centralized institutions is the whole point of crypto.Malik told CoinDesk she’s heartened by the reaction from the crypto crowd. “This support is very important for us ... it is very nice to realize that we are surrounded by such a large number of cool people.”But that may prove little solace if her life is effectively stolen from her for months, if not years.“People have the right to privacy … people can write open-source [code] and not be afraid that they will be put in jail and their whole life will be destroyed,” Malik said in a written statement. “I hope we get justice no matter how long it takes.”This isn’t the first time regulators tried to fix crypto using a rusty and ill-equipped toolbox, but it’s in everyone’s interest to figure out how to make blockchain fit with privacy, a puzzle raised in Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper and still unsolved.Either regulators continue to learn by doing, with all the pain that can cause, or the crypto community learns to stand up and be counted and show them how to do it better.“This is a wake-up call to that community that they need to recognize and protect the open source community that they rest on top of,” Cindy Cohn, executive director of online rights organization the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said in a phone interview. “They should not take it as a given that code development and innovation are just going to magically continue, as a kind of free resource. They will have to invest in protecting it.”In January, Semenov compared Tornado to the fights for online privacy in the early history of the web, leading to innovations like https secure encryption. Semenov declined to be interviewed for this article. But, in a message sent to CoinDesk, his colleague was more forthright about the risks the situation posed to the crypto community as a whole.""We are all f****d if nothing is changed,"" Storm said.UPDATE (Feb. 2, 2023, 17:41 UTC): Main story image, an artist's interpretive rendering of Pertsev, replaced with photo from courthouse.UPDATE (Dec. 12, 2022, 17:05 UTC): Clarifies Storm's comments referred to effect the Tornado Cash situation may have on the broader crypto industry.",2022/12/05
237,"An NFT of this image was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.What a difference a few weeks makes.Every year, CoinDesk plans its Most Influential list starting as early as August. Back then it seemed obvious who belonged in the rogue’s gallery of the 2022 crypto collapse (crippling an industry is, after all, a kind of influence, too). The four CEOs behind Terraform Labs, Celsius Network, Three Arrows Capital and Voyager Digital built flawed products, enticed retail investors to take huge undisclosed risks and borrowed heavily to lever themselves up to nosebleed heights. Then each of them blew up spectacularly.Now, of course, we’re dealing with a seemingly even darker figure: Sam Bankman-Fried, who not only did all of the above but also lent funds to himself and his inner circle, tracked billions in assets on a pile of crumpled napkins and strategically posed as a beneficent public-minded messiah while doing it. (That’s why he gets a story all to himself.)Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022In comparison, someone like LUNA creator Do Kwon could now seem almost innocuous. And the Four Horsemen, being the Machiavellian narcissists they seemingly are, have indeed seized the opportunity of Bankman-Fried’s unmasking to try and mend their own reputations. Kwon and Su Zhu in particular have stuck their heads up from various non-extradition spider holes to humanize themselves on chummy podcasts and argue that everything was SBF’s fault, really.So maybe it’s a good time to remind ourselves: Do Kwon, Su Zhu (with co-founder Kyle Davies), Alex Mashinsky and Stephen Ehrlich are hardly better than Sam Bankman-Fried. All of them acted out of ego, ignorance and reckless disregard for the people who trusted them with their money. None of them were actually as smart as they thought they were. Each is responsible for huge losses inflicted on more honest (if lazily trusting) players across the cryptosphere. All of them enriched themselves personally as they strode away from the destruction wrought by their failures.And none of them deserve the redemption arcs they’re seeking.As we gaze over the ruined landscape of the crypto market at the end of 2022, with assets down by more than two-thirds since one year ago, it’s impossible not to ask: Whose fault is this?The biggest, most fraudulent and most interlinked failures are easy to list. Do Kwon’s Terra ecosystem was the first keystone to crumble, in turn helping reveal weaknesses at Three Arrows, Celsius and Voyager.Terra was also, by some measures, the largest failure. Terra’s stablecoin terraUSD (UST) began to lose its peg on May 7, 2022, and the death spiral that followed was an inevitable consequence of its flawed design.At their height, Terra’s LUNA token and UST were valued at $60 billion, though that included a lot of illusory implied value. It’s still not entirely clear how much real money from investors was vaporized, but the amount is likely in the tens of billions.And a lot of the fake value was on the books at entities such as Three Arrows, which had about $200 million worth of LUNA on its balance sheet right alongside UST and bitcoin (BTC). Three Arrows, in turn, had received large loans from entities that aggregated retail investor funds, including about $75 million from Celsius.But trusting Three Arrows was simply one misstep among many at Celsius, which also lost as much as $350 million in customer funds through an apparently hapless active-trading program. The lending platform began to wobble as crypto markets declined over the course of early 2022. On June 12, Mashinsky issued his notorious demand that investor Mike Dudas find “even one person who has a problem withdrawing from Celsius.”The platform stopped withdrawals the very next day, and filed for bankruptcy on July 13.Three Arrows came next (though as we now know, far from last) with their disclosure of huge losses on June 17 and a bankruptcy filing on July 1. In addition to its big LUNA position, Three Arrows was also wounded by losing positions in Lido staked ETH (stETH) and the GBTC Bitcoin trust run by Grayscale (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group).Voyager followed just behind, suspending customer withdrawals and trading on July 1, then filing for Chapter 11 on July 5. Three Arrows was the most dramatic proximate cause for its failure – Voyager had loaned 3AC an absolutely gobsmacking $670 million.Far worse, this and other Voyager loans were, as CEO Steve Ehrlich had blithely put it in an investor call just weeks before the collapse, collateralized only in “a very small portion.” But Ehrlich assured listeners everything was fine because “the people we lend to are some of the biggest names in the industry.” “Other people trust them” is not the level of financial due diligence that should be expected of any lender – particularly one that fraudulently claimed its customer deposits were insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., of which Voyager was accused by the FDIC.These failures and many others were linked both by a variety of loans that couldn’t be recalled and more nuanced interconnections – a case study in financial contagion.Many smaller services acted as little more than front ends for Terra’s Anchor program, making it easier for less-crypto-savvy users to get a bit of that sweet 20% yield – and then lose 100% of their principal. Zhu and Davies’ Three Arrows was managing a reported $10 billion at the time of its collapse, a tally revealed to have been pumped up by extensive loans from entities including Blockchain.com, Genesis Trading (another Digital Currency Group company) and Voyager.Celsius, whether by luck or foresight, managed to withdraw more than $500 million worth of assets from Terra’s Anchor system before the collapse. But Celsius was also speculating with customer funds across a seemingly huge variety of DeFi platforms and assets, and the LUNA crash drove down prices across most of that ecosystem. So even if it wasn’t a direct hit, LUNA’s blast radius still badly wounded the lending platform.Celsius is believed to have had about $11.8 billion in deposits in May 2022, the month before its collapse. Unlike Three Arrows, though, much of that amount was deposited by individuals who trusted Mashinsky’s frequent, sneering insistence that Celsius was just like a bank, only better. Mashinsky’s rhetoric exemplified the crypto-carpetbagger’s impulse to simply parrot simpleminded slogans, while in fact contradicting one of the space’s fundamental appeals: self-custody.Voyager had attracted fewer assets, holding about $5.8 billion in deposits at its peak. That could hold a perverse lesson, because Steve Ehrlich’s relatively restrained personal style was seemingly outperformed by Mashinsky, Kwon and Su’s Donald Trump-like declarations and belittling of critics. Voyager pursued other ruthless and damaging marketing approaches, though, such as openly lying about FDIC insurance on user accounts and running a very generous promotion with Mark Cuban’s Dallas Mavericks basketball team that wound up costing fans a bundle. So while Voyager was the smallest of the big blowups, there was still plenty of pain to go around.Those are relatively simple measures – dates and numbers. They suggest, very broadly, that Terra was the first and biggest of the dark horses past the post, making it a flashpoint for contagion. Celsius, Voyager and Three Arrows were smaller by some measures, and came later, suggesting their failure was downstream from Terra’s.But the causality of the crypto collapse is ultimately a lot more complicated than any straightforward timeline, or even a comparison of balance sheets. Because finance is a form of time travel.Do Kwon’s Terra system collapsed two weeks after CoinDesk highlighted fundamental flaws in the design of the UST “algorithmic stablecoin” (I use air quotes because there’s actually no such thing). As soon as the token began to waver from its dollar peg in early May, it was all over but the shouting.The system had grown to such dangerous proportions for two basic reasons. First and foremost, the above-market returns promised by Terra’s Anchor system enticed many to buy the UST token for deposit there: Just a few weeks before the unwind, 72% of all UST was deposited in Anchor, meaning the 20% APR in Anchor was a major prop for the market value of both UST and the systemwide LUNA token.It has since become clear, however, that Anchor’s returns were not actually being generated by interest on loans, but instead largely came from other sources. Those sources included venture capital investments and tokens assigned to Do Kwon’s Terraform Labs and related entities, as well as revenue generated by retail buyers of LUNA and UST. That arguably made Anchor and Terra an obfuscated Ponzi scheme.At the same time, Do Kwon’s arrogant, venomous public persona helped keep his supporters lined up against anyone who questioned whether UST could really be magically worth $1 simply thanks to fancy math. But even as Kwon called critical analysts “retarded,” he had allegedly engaged external market makers to help prop up UST day to day. Whatever rationalization Kwon held in his own mind, UST was never actually self-balancing.But Kwon wasn’t alone in aggressively touting his creation. A shocking number of supposed professionals across the cryptosphere invested in or speculated with his financial perpetual motion machine (including, a recent report suggests, the team at Alameda Research). Investors in turn trumpeted their faith to the public, lending the system credibility and effectively baiting individual investors to deposit into Anchor or buy LUNA. That included, most stunningly, the formerly reputable Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital, who proudly showed off a huge LUNA tattoo.This is what I mean about things being more complicated than a simple timeline. Sure, Terra was the match that helped burn down Three Arrows and Celsius. But would Terra and Anchor have grown so big, or attracted so many direct retail deposits, without the apparent cosign of supposed experts like Novogratz? Or, for that matter, without the deposits Celsius itself parked there?Do Kwon was an incredibly loud, bullying defender of his own incredibly bad ideas. But much like his biotech analogue Elizabeth Holmes, it was big-money investors who poured jet fuel onto his flaming ineptitude, creating a cataclysm.“Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.” – Proverbs 16:18One of the things making the current downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX so unnerving is that he refrained, at least publicly, from the kind of philosophical grandstanding that is so often a red flag for bad actors. By contrast, the Four Horsemen often wore their dangerous mindsets and flawed assumptions on their sleeves.Three Arrows CEO Su Zhu was a bit more measured and informed in his arrogance than Kwon and Mashinsky – but arguably more extreme. Zhu frequently promoted his “supercycle theory,” which posited that bitcoin in particular would continue climbing in value indefinitely. One thing Zhu seemingly missed is the role of the coronavirus pandemic in bidding up crypto, tech stocks and a variety of other financial assets in early 2020.Three Arrows were hardly alone in this, of course – just ask anyone who lost their shirt on hot pandemic stocks like Peloton or Snapchat. But Three Arrows was so self-assured it forgot to do the “hedge” part of running a hedge fund. In fact, it did quite the opposite, levering up with all of those loans, drastically increasing the fallout when its positions went the wrong way.Three Arrows’ downfall exemplifies the dangerous cocktail of hubris and finance. It also epitomizes a perverse and increasingly crowded pipeline from highly respected institutions into the fraudster hall of fame: Zhu and Davies first met at the hyper-elite Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, before both moving on to Columbia University. Do Kwon was a graduate of Stanford.One is tempted to wonder exactly what’s being learned on America’s most hallowed campuses.Another common thread ties together our Four Horsemen: What they were doing was not really about cryptocurrency technology, but about using finance to profit from public interest in that technology.Zhu and Davies began Three Arrows as conventional foreign exchange traders, years before they began trading crypto. Mashinsky built what was basically an unregulated but otherwise conventional bank, hoping to profit from crypto trading and speculation. Steve Ehrlich’s past experience was running E-Trade’s professional brokerage services.Do Kwon is the arguable exception, having built an actual blockchain. But Terra didn’t bring any new decentralization technology to the table, only financial engineering flim-flam and the same artificially inflated yields that drove growth at Celsius and Voyager. (Sam Bankman-Fried was also a creature of the finance world, emerging from the trading firm Jane Street. He frequently admitted, including on an infamous “Odd Lots” episode, that he barely cared about the substance of crypto technology – only the profits to be reaped from trading it.)It may sound strange to level criticism at speculators and finance in an industry that’s all about reinventing money. But there’s a difference between the novelty of peer-to-peer payments and smart contracts, and the all-too-mundane impulse to gamble on the future growth of a novel technology.In a stellar profile of Zhu and Davies in New York Magazine, my former Fortune colleague Jenn Wieczner wrote, “They built social-media cred by playing the part of billionaire financial geniuses, translated that to actual financial credit, then put billions of dollars in borrowed money to work in speculative investments they could cheerlead to success with their large, influential platforms.”You can probably think of a few other billionaires that could easily be described, from disgraced “SPAC King” Chamath Palihapitiya to no less than Elon Musk. The rise and fall of the Horsemen, then, may say less about crypto than about much broader trends at the intersection of speculative investing and social media.What it does say about crypto is that much of the price appreciation of the 2020-2021 bull market was an illusion, based on rehypothecation and degenerate long bets at an unprecedented scale. Those who believe in the promise of crypto technology will likely spend years digging out of a pessimistic winter before the reputational damage done by speculators wears off.Let’s remember that the next time they come knocking.",2022/12/05
238,"More: An NFT of this image was sold at auction on Coinbase NFT. A percentage of the sale went to oneearth.org.When the history of blockchain is written, one of its most defining moments will be the years-long process culminating in September, when Ethereum developers pulled off a massive upgrade to its protocol known as “the Merge.”Switching the core of Ethereum’s blockchain mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) without any downtime was no small undertaking. It involved at least two years of testing and over 100 bi-weekly calls to maintain the $30 billion ecosystem that houses non-fungible tokens, crypto exchanges and other decentralized applications. Developers likened the task to swapping out a car’s gas engine for an electric one while speeding down the highway.Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022Vitalik Buterin is the co-founder, visionary and spiritual leader of the Ethereum ecosystem. He wrote the original white paper for Ethereum in 2014, in which he laid out the steps the blockchain would tackle in the years ahead, including the Merge.Buterin had six years of Bitcoin’s existence to observe and improve upon. By transitioning from proof-of-work – Bitcoin’s mechanism that used miners expending enormous computing power, and therefore enormous energy, to add transactions to the digital ledger – to proof-of-stake, which instead uses validators to approve blocks to the blockchain, Ethereum would reduce its carbon footprint by 99.9%. It would also increase the security of the blockchain and allow developers to introduce scalable upgrades to the blockchain in the future.While the vision and the basic blueprint was Buterin’s, what made the Merge an exceptionally difficult undertaking was that the Ethereum developers prioritized keeping the chain live during the switch.“There's a much easier way to do the Merge: We shut down for three days, do the thing and flip the switch back on and it restarts,” said Tim Beiko, protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation (EF). “We probably would have saved maybe somewhere between a quarter and a third of the work. So getting this switch to happen, basically seamlessly in a way that was like incentive compatible with miners, was pretty wild.”Read more: The Ethereum Merge Is Done, Opening a New Era for the Second-Biggest Blockchain The Merge could not have been accomplished without dozens of teams of developers, researchers and volunteers, both at Ethereum core and its clients. A client is a software that is used by the nodes operating the blockchain. The EF, a Swiss nonprofit dedicated to the building of Ethereum, coordinated the many client teams (at least nine of them with about 10-20 people per team) that built the testing, tooling and the actual proof-of-stake Beacon Chain into which the proof-of-work version of Ethereum merged. The massive undertaking involved multiple test nets, which are development versions of the blockchain to verify the soundness of the tasks. Many incremental steps had to be taken before the Merge could go ahead.Amidst all of these contributors, here are a few key developers who took this eight-year-old idea of Buterin’s and willed it to happen, successfully pulling off the massive upgrade that took place on Sept. 15:Beiko has been the protocol support lead at the EF since January 2021. He often leads the agenda on Ethereum’s All Core Developers Calls, a bi-weekly meetup of the network’s main engineers, and was in charge of coordinating the client teams who work with EF.When he’s not coordinating and directing traffic for dozens of teams, Beiko decompresses by tending to and hiking with his dog, Dodam, named after a Hong Kong restaurant specializing in Korean fried chicken.An occasional pastor (he preaches Sunday sermons at a Baptist Church from time to time), Edgington is the lead product owner at Teku, an Ethereum client built by R&D firm ConsenSys. Edgington built out the Teku product team, where he worked closely with the ConsenSys Besu team, Ethereum’s execution client.Jayanthi has been a devops engineer at EF since December 2020, after discovering on Twitter the EF was seeking to fill the position. An avid fan of fusion music, Jayanthi pioneered the testing of the Beacon Chain and helped coordinate shadow forks, which were crucial tests that helped debug any issues that arose.Kalinin has a passion for detail and history, as evidenced by his hobby of reconstructing costumes from the 13th, 14th and 16th centuries. He is a lead researcher at ConsenSys who many developers have described as a significant driving force behind the Merge; without him, there might be no Merge. He was instrumental in designing the actual mechanism and wrote the specifications for implementing the Merge.Even in his free time, Van Der Wijden likes to build. He enjoys Factorio, the crowdfunded video game where he builds massive virtual factories. In his day job as a software developer at EF, during the runup to the Merge Van Der Wijden wrote guides for the Consensus Layer clients so they could use their software with Geth, a client of Ethereum. He also created tools that were used during shadow forks to create bad blocks that would identify issues in some clients.Wang has been a researcher at EF since 2017, where she worked on sharding, a method that should help address network congestion and high gas fees by spreading transactions across databases, or “shards.” Eventually she was pulled into working on the Merge, and specifically worked on Consensus Layer specifications.Back in August 2021, Wang famously created a meme to visually express the Merge both in concept and progress over time. A white bear (proof-of-work Ethereum) and a black bear (proof-of-stake Beacon Chain) do the Dragon Ball Z Fusion Dance, moving closer and closer until they morph into a black-and-white panda. The meme went viral and was even turned into NFT, the revenue from which she devoted in part to nonprofit animal welfare organizations.Zouarhi joined ConsenSys as a research engineer in 2017 and then became a product lead for Besu, an execution client of Ethereum, seeing the Merge build through June when most of the heavy lifting was completed. Her main priorities included working with core developers and laying out what the priorities were for the Besu client team.A keen fan of “Star Wars” and especially the red-and-black-faced Sith warrior and schemer Darth Maul, whom she enjoys cosplaying, Zouarhi currently is a product manager at Blocknative, where she is working on Maximal Extractable Value (MEV).Read more: Meet 8 Ethereum Developers Who Helped Make the Merge PossibleEthereum switching over from PoW to PoS was like the entire country of Finland shutting down its power grid, according to the Digiconomist. The direct impact of the event also led to a world reduction in energy consumption by 0.2%.With the Merge accomplished, Buterin has shared a roadmap for Ethereum to next address a host of issues including security, privacy, censorship, scalability issues and more, such as sharding.The Ethereum developers said they hope they have inspired other blockchains, such as Dogecoin, to switch to PoS. PoW chains have come under more scrutiny from regulators due to their environmental impacts. Edgington shared that the European Union “is already talking about turning off PoW, due to the energy crisis.”“It is fair for them to have waited for Ethereum and be like, ‘this thing works.’ And now that it does, I honestly don't believe that there's a reason” they shouldn’t move over, said Beiko to CoinDesk.To make that process easier, developers have shared their Merge resources with the rest of the world. “If someone wants to go through the Merge, they can just take that and reuse the testing infrastructure,” said Jayanthi.",2022/12/05
239,"When Zcash, the privacy-preserving protocol, forked off from Bitcoin in 2016, it was the first large-scale commercial use of zero-knowledge proofs. Since then, the team developing Zcash has continued to innovate – pushing the boundaries of computer science and cryptography.This year has been no different. In an interview with CoinDesk, Zooko Wilcox, CEO of the company leading Zcash development, the Electric Coin Company (ECC), discussed the protocol’s much-anticipated NU5 upgrade that went live in May.Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022The upgrade did many things – it came with a shiny new wallet and software development kit – but above all radically improved privacy across the network while reducing the amount of trust anyone needs to have in Wilcox, ECC or Zcash itself to transact anonymously.And it couldn’t have come at a better time. In August, the U.S. Treasury Department levied unprecedented sanctions against the crypto-mixing service Tornado Cash, effectively barring U.S. users from concealing their blockchain history on Ethereum.“This was the year the crypto industry woke up to the fact that fully transparent protocols are vulnerable. They're capturable. They're attackable. And this is what we've always believed; like, this is why we started Zcash,” Wilcox told CoinDesk.Zcash’s 2022 overhaul saw the introduction of a new type of zero-knowledge proof system called Halo (zero-knowledge refers to a system where someone can prove they know information without revealing that information). Developed by ECC engineer Sean Bowe, Halo is said to be the first “trustless and recursive” ZKP. These are “technical terms,” Wilcox said, while removing his retainer – but it’s a big deal.Today, almost all encrypted apps and protocols are built on top of something called a “trusted setup,” a special type of procedure where private keys are generated, including Zcash. Obviously, “trust” runs antithetical to what crypto is trying to achieve – if someone gets hold of a protocol’s key, they can compromise the entire system.This was always the critical vulnerability at the heart of Zcash, even though the protocol’s key ceremony is legendary in cryptography circles for the lengths its six participants, spread across the globe, took to maximize security.(As it turns out, human rights activist Edward Snowden was one of the few people involved in Zcash’s weekend-long creation, privacy advocate Naomi Brockwell reported first in CoinDesk.)“Our previous generation of zero-knowledge proofs is pretty much the gold standard throughout the industry. A lot of the science and source code we developed has been copied and reused by almost everyone,” Wilcox said. However, no matter how trustworthy Zooko or Snowden were perceived to be, they were still partial key holders and therefore centralized points of failure that had to be eliminated.It’s likely that Halo’s new “trustless setup” will also be widely adopted and set a new bar for encryption. The practice also solves the issue that in the distant future, some people might lose faith that some key ceremony was not compromised. Now, anyone can just crunch the math to know the system is computationally secure, without having to take Wilcox’s word for it.“We see Zcash as a fundamental, permanent part of humanity's legacy and toolkit,” Wilcox said.In addition to removing a gigantic attack surface on Zcash, Halo’s implementation also makes the system highly scalable by the introduction of a new kind of z-SNARK (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) called a Plonk. (ECC’s blog said the innovation here is by “allowing any amount of computational effort and data to produce a short proof that can be checked quickly.)In the months since the upgrade was deployed, a number of projects have started using Plonk-based privacy apps – from ZK EVMs (Ethereum virtual machines) to Filecoin’s decentralized storage system and even a machine learning AI program.Considering the “Cambrian explosion” of ZK implementations in the past half decade, and the fact the ZK-proofs were mostly an arcane, academic topic since the 1980s until recently, Zooko said he thinks the crypto industry’s continued experimentation “goes sort of unacknowledged.”“The cryptocurrency phenomenon has unlocked an economic sustainability for all kinds of technological development,” he said, referring to token-based crowdfunding. “It's really underappreciated how the economic effect of decentralized and diverse and permissionless innovation being able to get funded without having to depend on the legacy gatekeepers and controllers.”As it turns out, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission took aim at Zcash this year for its controversial funding model and “premine” – alleging the project may be a security. This caused many of the few exchanges, like Huobi, that had listed ZEC to drop it and other privacy coins. In fact, concerns over centralized control by Zooko and ECC over Zcash have long plagued the project.Zooko seems zen on that point. In our interview, he admitted to settling into the idea that he’s the face of the blockchain that resembles his name. “Having a recognizable spokesperson is pretty necessary,” he said. “But I think people are really oversimplifying and wrong if they think that Zcash depends on that.”",2022/12/05
240,"Unless you have been on another planet, you probably know that, since the start of 2022, selling risk assets like U.S. stocks and bitcoin (BTC) and buying the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen (JPY) have been some of the most popular macro bets.Investors have been reassessing their commitment to these so-called hawkish Federal Reserve trades in recent weeks and piling back into risk assets, except bitcoin, thanks to the peak inflation narrative and the central bank hinting at moderation in liquidity tightening from December.The S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index, has gained 16% in less than two months to trade above the widely-tracked 200-day moving average for the first time since early April. The USD/JPY pair, often called a turbo bet on the Fed policy and U.S. rates, has dropped 11% to its 200-day moving average. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, has also dropped below its 200-day average.The U.S. government bond yields have come off sharply from the yearly highs, validating the peak inflation narrative and the resulting risk revival in equity and currency markets.Bitcoin, however, appears to have decoupled from macroeconomic developments and traditional markets. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency by market value changed hands at $17,340 or traded at a discount of 22% to its 200-day moving average.This shows that the FTX insolvency couldn't have come at a worse time for bitcoin and the broader crypto market.""Historically, (U.S.) stocks and crypto have a strong relationship with each other. Without FTX implosion, bitcoin might have been trading at $29,000 by now – instead of $17,200 (or 69% higher),"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said.""If the market can move on from FTX, those prices could still be achieved,"" Thielen said.Bitcoin slipped to a two-year low of $15,480 last month.The dollar index peaked and turned lower at the end of September, having risen nearly 20% in the first nine months of the year. Following the bearish turnaround in the greenback, the S&P 500 found a bottom in mid-October.Bitcoin's recent market activity suggests the worst from FTX's insolvency may be behind us. The leading cryptocurrency rose 4% last week, even though prominent crypto lender BlockFi filed for bankruptcy protection.""There are signs that the overhang of bad news in recent weeks is having a less pronounced impact on crypto performance, even if the full context of the uncertainty hasn't been completely priced in,"" Coinbase Institutional's weekly note said, while drawing attention to the recent moderation in the negative sentiment in the options market.Bitcoin's one-month call-put skew, which measures the premium investors pay for out-of-the-money (OTM) calls versus OTM puts, has bounced to -9% from -29% seen on Nov. 13.Put options offer protection against price slides, while calls offer insurance against bull runs.The recovery suggests that the height of the fear cycle has faded. Therefore, crypto investors may now focus on the improved macro backdrop and the risk reset in traditional markets.One question is whether the latest risk revival in traditional markets will be long-lasting, given that the U.S. economy is heading toward a recession. The situation identified by consecutive quarterly contractions in the growth rate does not sound conducive to risk assets.However, a recession could turn out to be a blessing in disguise, according to an analysis by macro trader Geo Chen.""The Fed is over-tightening into a recession that has likely already started, and this will likely result in a downtrend in inflation that will be more persistent than many expect,"" Chen said in a Substack post published on Nov. 22.""The biggest driver of asset prices this year has been yields and inflation, so a downtrend in yields should be a tailwind for asset prices and make next year look like the mirror image of this year,"" Chen added.",2022/12/05

Powell noted encouraging signs that inflation and the still vibrant job market were slowing.In an email to CoinDesk, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote that ""the market"" had ""responded positively to Powell's speech, although he added that ""we may want to see bitcoin consolidating above $17K and possibly testing $20K before we expect a sustained recovery.""""On the downside, $16K is a key support, losing which we are likely to see bitcoin trending lower,"" DiPasquale wrote.Ether remained steadfast near $1,300, up about 3%. On Dec. 1, CoinDesk market analyst Glenn Williams noted that ether's price had outperformed bitcoin over the previous 10 days, increasing 15.4% versus BTC's 7.7% rise. Williams wrote that a so-called crossover of the ETH/BTC 10-day moving average above the 100-day moving average is often a bullish sign, although he added that the recent sample size is still too small to come to a conclusion.Other major cryptos were largely in the green with SOL, the token of the smart contracts Solana blockchain platform, rising more than 4%, and ATOM, the token of the decentralized blockchain network, Cosmos, recently up more than 3%.

""Any dovish comments then could see the market moving higher,"" he wrote of the latter.DeFi TVL Continues Its Recent MomentumBy Sam ReynoldsCrypto investors have been focusing hard lately on the wider impact of crypto exchange FTX’s collapse and macroeconomic uncertainties. They have watched bitcoin hover at $17,000 support after wrestling with $16,000 for large portions of November. Will it tip lower or higher in the weeks ahead?Overlooked in the focus on pricing is the slow, steady recovery in the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Data from DeFi Llama, a DeFi aggregator for TVL, shows that TVL is trickling back to the 10 biggest DeFi protocols on Ethereum as asset prices rise.The increase follows the implosion of TVL in Solana-based protocols in mid-November because of a lack of confidence in a platform that’s perceived as being closely tied to Sam Bankman-Fried, and due to falling asset prices.Lido has seen its TVL increase by 3.69% during the last week, Curve is up 3%, and Compound Finance’s TVL is up by about 4.6%. Derivatives Decentralized Exchange GMX has seen its TVL rise by 6%.The high correlation between the rise of TVL in major DeFi protocols and climbing token prices is a good thing, signaling that there’s still continued trust in DeFi, and that assets aren’t being withdrawn. Nansen data shows that protocols such as Curve.fi and dYdx have continued inflows of stablecoins during the past week.The market’s continued confidence in DeFi is impressive, given ongoing concerns about security. Just last week another DeFi protocol, Ankr, was exploited because of shoddy code found by an attacker. Granted, Binance had frozen a significant amount of the stolen assets – but these major DeFi hacks seem to be a bimonthly occurrence.Investors, nevertheless, appear willing to overlook such events, and instead, seem more focused on DeFi’s potential.10:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(2:00 UTC) European Union Retail Sales (YoY/Oct)3:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:00 UTC) United States ISM Services PMI (Nov)3:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(19:30 UTC) Reserve Bank of Australia Interest Rate DecisionIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Slips After November Jobs Report; US Justice Dept Calls for Independent Probe of Alleged FTX FraudThe U.S. economy added 263,000 jobs in November, more than expected.

242,"As a Greek-American, I’ve been paying attention to the European Central Bank (ECB) for too long.Imagine the scene: There’s a teenager on the way to soccer practice absolutely in shambles because he just learned that Goldman Sachs brokered a cross-currency swap for Greece so that the latter could gain admission into the eurozone. The teenager then systematically loses his mind after each austerity package is announced in the following months and years.That teenager was me.You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.Next, imagine that now-adult person, who writes about bitcoin for a living, reading a ECB blog post with the title: “Bitcoin’s last stand.”The kid can’t catch a break. But no need to imagine because this actually happened last Wednesday. It’s critical to level-set that the published article doesn’t represent an official position of the ECB. It’s just a blog post on the ECB’s official website. But because it’s on the ECB’s official website, it is flying under a banner of authority. As such, it is worth parsing through the main points brought up in the post.The post starts with an unsubstantiated (which was never substantiated later) point that bitcoin’s current price action is “an artificially induced last gasp before the road to irrelevance.” But what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence. So, let’s dismiss this point.The next section in the ECB post is titled: “Bitcoin is rarely used for legal transactions.” Unfortunately, the body of the section doesn’t prove this point specifically (a shame, really, because it isn’t true) and instead focuses on how bitcoin’s value is based solely on speculation because a) it has no cash flow (like real estate), dividends (like equities), productivity (like commodities) or social benefits (like gold) and b) VCs are propping it up with $17.9 billion of investment in blockchain and crypto.On a), not all real estate generates cash flow, Google has never paid a dividend, people use bitcoin so it is productive and there are clear social benefits to bitcoin. On b), the idea that $17.9 billion of VC investment in blockchain and crypto is enough to sustain $300 billion of value to bitcoin is frankly absurd, but I’ll concede that point because VCs do have vaunted reputations, so their involvement might, in fact, be propping up some of bitcoin’s market value.Point is, there’s more than just speculation giving bitcoin value, even if speculation is part of it.The last two sections in the ECB post are about how regulation can be misunderstood as approval, complete with a tired jab about Bitcoin energy pollution, and how promoting bitcoin bears a reputational risk for banks.On the former point about regulation, I agree. Regulation could be misunderstood as approval, and regulation has prompted “the conventional financial industry to make it easier for customers to access bitcoin.” And yes, maybe this ease has suggested to small investors that bitcoin is a sound investment even if some other investors don’t think so. But that’s exactly how markets work: Some people think something is worth buying and some people think something is worth selling. Just because you think something is worth selling doesn’t mean that it isn’t worth buying.As for the authors noting that the “Bitcoin system is an unprecedented polluter,” I will point you to some of the many articles and reports about this in particular (here, here, here and here). But just for the sake of a semantic argument (which are bad arguments), the energy sector is really the only “unprecedented polluter” given it’s the biggest.On the latter, banks have enough reputational risk on their own. Two examples:Sure, this doesn’t mean there might not be reputational risk for banks associated with promoting bitcoin, but surely there’s a reputational merit outweighing this risk if bitcoin works out and customers make money.In summary, I think this blog post is just that: a short blog post that isn’t meant to represent anything definitive. I look forward to a more thoughtful, wholesome report on bitcoin’s march to irrelevance by the ECB in the future.Meanwhile in Bitcoin-only-land, a firm called Casa added support for the Ethereum blockchain last week and a cross-section of bitcoiners weren’t happy about it.Casa enables customers to create digital vaults to store bitcoin and bitcoin only. Think of it as a safe, but digital and specifically for bitcoin. Now, Casa is enabling customers to also store ether (the native token of Ethereum). The reason this move kicked up dust with some bitcoiners is because there is a shared ideal that Bitcoin-only businesses are The Way and anything else is a divergence from that ideal and should be punished. A firm, company or business moving from Bitcoin-only to not Bitcoin-only is perceived as a character flaw of the proprietors at best and an attack on Bitcoin at worst.Listen, I’m probably the last CoinDesker who would talk to you about the viability of blockchains for anything except money without a centralized mint, and I’m also probably the last CoinDesker who would tell you what you should do and how you should do it. But I think the view that Casa’s move is somehow emblematic of the poor character of its founders or an attack on Bitcoin is patently absurd.Casa made a business decision. Customers wanted ether vaults, so Casa sold them ether vaults. If you don’t want an ether vault, don’t use an ether vault. Casa still offers bitcoin vaults, so use that. Or don’t! Use a competitor product or create your own. Casa is not forcing customers to do anything.As with all my takes, this one will no doubt make me immensely popular, but in the words of Casa Chief Technology Officer Jameson Lopp, what makes you think I care?",2022/12/04

The money seized by Teneo – the New York-based liquidation firm appointed by a British Virgin Islands court – is the largest chunk of money obtained since Three Arrows imploded in July, leaving a $3.5 billion debt in its wake.An unknown group of attackers were able to drain some $15 million in liquidity from BNB Chain-based staking platform Helio on Friday morning after exploiting an oracle issue on the protocol, on-chain data shows.

244,"On Nov. 14, as the rapidly widening contagion from the FTX exchange’s collapse was thrusting crypto into an existential crisis, shoemaking giant Nike launched its bold new Web3 platform, SWOOSH.The initiative, which will allow Nike sneaker fans to buy and sell the brand’s digital wearables and to create their own collectibles powered by non-fungible tokens, is one of many such projects from household brands that are powering along as if nothing has happened in the wider world of crypto. These include Starbucks, the National Football League and its players, Instagram, Budweiser, Adidas, Dolce & Gabbana and Time. The list goes on.It’s why a common refrain I heard, during conversations with the NFT crowd during Art Basel in Miami this week, was that crypto will be saved by brands.You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.That may be the case, and it’s all well and good that spending on such projects will help offset the big pullback in expenditure by native crypto companies. But it also evokes concern among many who were drawn to this industry’s rebellious, disruptive appeal and by its promise to level the playing field by giving creators and users greater control over their money, content and data.The question we must ask is: As crypto gets corporatized, will it lose its edge?To an extent, the answer is unavoidably yes. The crypto industry will have to bend to the legal and marketing concerns of image-conscious, bureaucratic public companies. Already it’s clear that trigger words like “crypto,” “blockchain” and even “NFTs” are being excluded from materials in favor of the generic idea of “digital collectibles.”All is not lost, though. So far, brands’ activities in this space seem born of the right, inclusive spirit. There is a real effort, for example, to give artists, musicians and writers greater control over their work, to dramatically boost the royalties they receive and to seek out diverse creative backgrounds and styles. At a Miami event honoring the artists behind Time Magazine’s Timepieces NFT series, many said they felt appreciated and empowered by what Time, under the leadership of outgoing President Keith Grossman, has built.Read more: NFTs and Intellectual Property: What Do You Actually Own?There’s even a similar vibe at Instagram, which as a subsidiary of Meta Platforms is often viewed as an extension of the social media giant’s massive control over people’s data, content and lives. The platform’s latest trial with a group of NFT-savvy influencers not only allows them to make, buy and sell collectible content, they can also use the technology to build new exclusive-access business models, working directly with their most loyal audience members. At least in spirit, it hews to the Web3 principles of pushing control and ownership to creators and users.But before we start celebrating the liberation of struggling artists everywhere, let’s recall that Meta itself started out its metaverse project with plans to charge fees of up to 47.5% for the privilege of using it. That monopoly-like pricing model prompted both anger and laughter from the crypto community.Already the Web3 economy emerging from these brands’ ad hoc projects is rife with contradictions. We must disentangle them if we are to properly assert the principles of competition and ease of access that are needed to assume an open, disintermediated Web3 future.Consider the pricing and fee structure that artists working with the new Instagram NFT project face.On the one hand, it bars influencers from pricing their works higher than $1,000. Although this in itself is a form of market restriction, the price limit is being welcomed as a way to allow more inclusivity than, say, marketplace OpenSea, where NFTs sold at multi-million-dollar prices to crypto-rich collectors at the height of last year’s boom. It could encourage broader participation and allow the NFT business model to evolve into one that’s more inclusive of the mainstream.On the other hand, artists involved in the project are having to hand over a fee of 30% for each sale.Is this, yet again, the curse of control by an overly powerful, intermediating internet platform? Well, yes, but it turns out the monopoly is not Instagram’s, which isn’t charging anything to its artists, but Apple’s. The iPhone producer is hitting Instagram with its routine fee for all products sold over apps purchased via its app store.But before you get into a lather of outrage at CEO Tim Cook, let’s look at that egalitarian pricing structure. Where did it come from? Turns out it’s also based on Apple’s rules.Read more: Apple Refuses to Exempt NFTs From App Store’s 30% FeeAll of this offers a reminder that in Web2, centralized platforms like Meta and Apple have enormous power to shape the information, art and entertainment markets on which society, indeed our democracy and culture, depend.This is why open metaverse projects such as Punk 6529’s Om and Lamina1, founded by Bitcoin pioneer Peter Vessenes and sci-fi author Neal Stephenson, are important. In different ways, they are both built on first-principle frameworks that aim to prevent anyone from controlling any core applications or infrastructure and from setting up rent-seeking gateways through which creators or users would have to enter their worlds.Read more: NFT Investor Animoca Brands to Start $2B Metaverse Fund: ReportIt’s not enough to depend on the goodwill of legacy platforms and of the mega-companies that use them to reach audiences and customers. We must deliberately build systems over which those corporate machines can’t exert control.That is the core spirit of crypto and it provides a message to the rebellious coders and censorship-resisting creators who’ve been drawn to it: It’s okay to accept these companies’ money but look hard at what strings are attached, and then make sure enough of that funding finds its way to those who can build the decentralized protocols, applications and APIs needed to keep the system open.(For more about the growing participation of brands in Web3, check out my colleague Sam Ewen’s and Vayner3 President Avery Akkineni’s new podcast, “GenC”.)",2022/12/02
245,"Bitcoin miners, which already have up to $2.5 billion in loans outstanding, could find themselves in even hotter water as many have exposure to failed crypto exchange FTX and lenders such as BlockFi.Miners’ balance sheets have been steadily deteriorating over the past few months as the price of bitcoin has slumped, killing their revenue. Meanwhile, energy prices have soared, increasing their costs. This has resulted in one of the biggest mining data center operators in the U.S., Compute North, to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September, while big players such as Core Scientific (CORZ), Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Greenidge Generation (GREE) have said they are in a liquidity crunch. The stock prices of all three publicly traded miners have plunged more than 90% this year.Now, some of the lenders working with these already struggling bitcoin miners are in deeper trouble after getting caught up in the FTX blowup – potentially causing another major hit for the mining industry.“ASIC financiers going through distress and bankruptcy will contribute to the cost of capital rising significantly in the space, and access to capital drying up,” said mining service firm Luxor’s chief operating officer, Ethan Vera, who also estimated the total debt of up to $2.5 billion outstanding for the miners.If lenders go bankrupt, creditors are likely to try to liquidate some of the equipment loans, he said. In some cases, “it might be too difficult for a bankrupt company to continue to operate a loan book, in which case liquidating these existing loans will result in a significant haircut,” according to Vera.Not many miners have direct exposure to FTX’s assets. However, the crypto exchange contributed to a $431 million funding round for miner Genesis Digital Assets (GDA) in September of last year.The company’s spokesperson didn’t comment on FTX's investment but said GDA has no assets or accounts with FTX. Genesis Digital Assets is not related to CoinDesk’s sister company, Genesis Global.Other key forms of exposures came from mining companies taking out large sums of loans from lenders such as BlockFi, Silvergate and Galaxy Digital, all of which have some exposure to Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) exchange.Still, considering that many miners are private and don’t share their debt obligations or exposure, the impact of the FTX implosion is uncertain. “We don’t know where all of the exposed counterparties are. And so for the industry, it’s really going to depend where new holes show up,” Jaime Leverton, CEO of Hut 8 (HUT), said during the firm’s third-quarter earnings call.BlockFi became one of the many victims of FTX contagion and filed for bankruptcy protection in a federal court in New Jersey. The lender holds at least three mining machines-backed loans to publicly listed companies, crucially the $54 million that Core Scientific owes the lender. The miner, the U.S.’s biggest by computing power, is currently in talks to restructure its debt obligations that totaled about $244 million in loans and $597 in convertible and promissory notes at the end of the third quarter.A Core Scientific spokesperson did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment on this story.Canadian miner Bitfarms (BITF) also borrowed $32 million from BlockFi, but only about $22 million of that is outstanding as of the end of September. Meanwhile, peer Cipher Mining (CIFR) secured a $46.9 credit facility for a joint venture with energy firm WindHQ, of which it owns 49%.A Bitfarms spokesperson declined to comment on the story. The miner has been actively trying to reduce its leverage and said it paid down $27 million of bitcoin- and equipment-backed debt on Nov. 14.Cipher CEO Tyler Page said the company had drawn about $26 million of the BlockFi facility and “never anticipated any further draws” after a second one made in August, so it isn’t concerned about BlockFi’s issue. Less than $10 million of that is outstanding, and the joint venture “continues to service the debt as expected,” Page said.BlockFi and other lenders also hold undisclosed debt to privately held miners, which is hard to estimate due to non-disclosure agreements. BlockFi spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment on this story.Silvergate Capital, a digital assets bank and infrastructure provider, said that of its $11.9 billion in customer deposits, only 10% belongs to FTX and the bank has no outstanding loans related to FTX. The crypto bank also said that its BlockFi digital-asset deposit exposure totals less than $20 million.One of the biggest publicly traded miners, Marathon Digital (MARA), has drawn $100 million in total, equally from two bitcoin-backed debt instruments that have a cap at $100 million each, said Marathon’s vice president of corporate communications, Charlie Schumacher. One is a term loan and the other is a revolving credit facility, both with Silvergate Capital.As the news of FTX’s collapse started spreading and the price of bitcoin started to decline, Marathon had to post more collateral to back its dollar-denominated outstanding debt, Schumacher explained.As of Nov. 9, only 1,950 BTC (about $30.6 million) of Marathon’s 11,440 BTC was unrestricted, meaning it can be used for business purposes, the firm said in its third-quarter earnings report. If bitcoin’s price declined further, Marathon would have to post more collateral, hence restricting more of its bitcoin holdings.The mining firm has decided to reduce some of its obligations given the market uncertainty and volatility. “Given what's going on in the broader markets, we want to make sure that we have even more breathing room,” Schumacher said.Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital (GLXY) has $76.8 million of cash and digital assets tied to the exchange, the firm said in its third-quarter earnings report. Galaxy has been reported to be looking to cut nearly 62% of its exposure to FTX. Galaxy has also been active in lending to miners.Bitfarms is one of the miners that secured a $100 million bitcoin-backed credit facility from Galaxy. However, after paying down parts of the loan and amending some of the terms, the outstanding balance is $23 million, at the end of the third quarter.Galaxy’s exposure to FTX hasn’t impacted its services and offerings for clients and the company continues to take a “a prudent, risk-managed approach toward financing arrangements in the mining space,” said the firm’s head of communications, Mike Wursthorn.Galaxy is not in distress but other players that took significantly larger exposures will likely have issues, according to Wursthorn. “We are focused on secondary activity of ASICs, both from direct miners as well as lenders, and are in a good position to provide liquidity at good values for that equipment,” he noted.During the third quarter, the Galaxy mining arm closed three existing machine leases totaling about $8 million “at expected terms without defaults, delinquencies, or losses,” Wursthorn added.The shares of Galaxy fell about 81% on the Toronto exchange this year.Crypto mining and staking firm, Foundry, has no direct exposure to FTX, but is indirectly tied to it through its sister company, Genesis Global, which is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group. Genesis said its derivatives business unit has about $175 million of funds locked into its FTX account. DCG granted a $140 million equity infusion to the trading firm.A Greenidge spokesperson said it has an outstanding loan to Foundry, which is a “fraction” of the original amount, but said that its “risk management strategy of liquidating” bitcoin mining revenue and “and removing all funds from exchanges daily was specifically designed to prevent” exposure to exchanges.Bitfarms owes just above $1.5 million to Foundry, as of Sept. 30.Foundry declined to comment on this story.Canadian miner Hut 8 (HUT) said it paid off its debt to Foundry earlier this year and never drew from a $50 million credit facility from Galaxy, according to Erin Dermer, Hut 8’s senior vice president of communications and culture.Meanwhile, another crypto lender, NYDIG, said it has consistently passed on opportunities to invest in the likes of FTX. Similarly, financial firm BlockFills said that it has zero exposure to Genesis Global, BlockFi, FTX or Alameda Research.",2022/12/02

Futures traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) had priced in an 81% chance of a 50 basis point move. In the minutes following Friday’s jobs report, that percentage was 77%.“Given our progress in tightening policy, the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation, and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level,” Powell said in his Wednesday remarks. “It seems to me likely that the ultimate level of rates will need to be somewhat higher than thought at the time of the September meeting.”UPDATE (Dec. 2, 13:56): Adds additional reporting.",2022/12/02

Some tokens have lost as much as 95% of their value amid the contagion, and bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has plunged more than 60%.IEOs usually see users lock up a certain amount of that exchange’s native tokens for allocation in another token that would soon be traded on that exchange.A total of 114,772 participants committed 9,010,765.2954 BNB during the subscription period, representing an oversubscription of 1,066x. Users would receive 139.44 HOOK to 13,944 HOOK based on the BNB they lock up. The BNB would be returned to users after HOOK is distributed – minus a predetermined fixed amount ranging from 0.4 BNB to 4 BNB.Hooked Protocol builds the on-ramp layer for Web3 applications and bespoke ""learn and earn"" products. HOOK is the governance token of the ecosystem, and is used to access community events and exclusive NFTs, and for in-app purchases, including game tools, for dapps built on Hooked.Hooked Protocol has raised over $6 million from two rounds of private token sales earlier this year and has a current valuation of $60 million.

250,"Ether's price has outperformed bitcoin over the past 10 days, increasing 15.4% versus BTC's 7.7% rise.Momentum in the ETH/BTC pairing over the same time period spiked 39%, using the 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI) as a proxy for price acceleration. The RSI is a technical indicator that measures the magnitude of price changes for an asset. It can be used by investors to determine the speed of price movement, allowing it to be compared to past price levels.The current RSI for the ETH/BTC pair is 57.22. Filtering for RSI levels above 55 but below 58 for data dating to 2017 yields inconclusive results. In more than 1,845 observations, the RSI for the ETH/BTC pair has fallen within this range just 116 times.The average seven-day return following each occurrence was 2.1% higher. The 30-day return was a much less impressive 0.1% increase, implying that prices have tended to trail off.The potential crossing of the ETH/BTC 10-day moving average above the 100-day moving average is poised to occur Thursday. This so-called moving average crossover occurs when a shorter time frame moving average crosses above a longer period moving average. A positive crossover is often a bullish sign.Data over the same time period shows positive results, but also highlights how infrequently it has occurred. Since 2017, data shows that the 10-period moving average of the ETH/BTC pair has crossed above the 100-period moving average just 16 times.Over that time frame, the average seven-day return following the crossover was 1.5% higher, while the average 30-day return expanded to 6.1%.The data suggests that a crossover is either such a rare occurrence that it should be exploited immediately, or that the sample size isn’t large enough to come to a definitive conclusion. I fall in the second camp as I view the crossover as meaningful but warranting more observation before putting capital to work.",2022/12/01
251,"Speaking Wednesday at a Brookings Institution event, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell more or less confirmed what has been suggested for weeks – that this month the central bank was going to ratchet back the pace of interest rate hikes from 75 basis points to 50 basis points.Equity markets soared on the news, led by the Nasdaq’s 4.5% advance. Bitcoin (BTC) rallied as well, briefly topping $17,000 from the mid-$16,000 area (it’s trading at $16,900 at press time). The rallies were somewhat surprising as bets on a smaller-than-usual rate hike in December barely changed after Powell’s comments on Wednesday.According to the CME’s FedWatch Tool, after Powell's address market participants saw a 77% chance of a 50-basis point move coming out of the Federal Open Market Committee's mid-December meeting, up a hair from 76% prior to the Fed chair’s speech.The small change signals that traders may be waiting for more data from the jobs report on Friday.November’s payroll report from the Labor Department on Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET is expected to show 200,000 added jobs, according to economists polled by FactSet. That would be down from 261,000 in October and the slowest monthly increase in hiring in two years.“I don’t think a weak report is a non-event,” said Bob Iaccino, Path Trading Partners co-founder and chief market strategist. “The probability hasn’t really moved much, which tells me that 50 basis points is not truly priced in yet,” he added.While a slowing pace of job growth might signal the Fed is getting its wish of a weaker economy and possibly less inflationary pressure, Powell on Wednesday reminded it’s not necessarily enough. He noted another survey showing there remains a lofty 1.7 job openings for every person searching for a job.“So far we have seen only tentative signs of moderation of labor demand,” Powell said, pointing out only “modest” declines in wage growth that remains well above where the Fed would like it to be.“To be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing,” he said. “But for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2% inflation.”",2022/12/01

The FTX collapse was just a nail in the troubled firm’s coffin.All that said, those of us who are experienced investors know that often the times of greatest calamity provide some of the best investment opportunities.In addition to seeking advice on how to protect and store their own digital assets amid the chaos, the crypto-curious clientele of financial advisors are surely interested in hearing about these opportunities – but where are they?You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors.

(Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.) Several other closed- and open-ended crypto funds have been trading at similarly steep discounts.Read more: Cathie Wood's Ark Invest Buys $1.5M in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust SharesIf one feels fairly confident that the value of the digital assets these funds hold will start to rise once again, then buying funds at such a large discount could be the rough equivalent of buying a dollar for 55 cents.Of course, there’s no guarantee that such funds will trade at a premium to their assets – or even reach par in the future – but most financial assets demonstrate some level of reversion to the mean.Another potential option for crypto-curious investors seeking a little security: options, according to emailed comments Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer Proshares Investments.“Bitcoin futures-linked ETFs, such as ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI), provide a belt-and-suspenders approach,” wrote Hyman. “They use regulated futures to gain exposure to bitcoin-linked returns, and they do so in the efficient, regulated wrapper of an ETF.”Hyman noted that ProShares bitcoin futures ETFs have been trading with tight spreads and little deviation from their NAV, despite the recent volatility in crypto asset prices.Read more: Everything You Need to Know About Bitcoin ETFsMajor institutions, including large pension funds such as the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan and private investment specialists like Sequoia Capital are writing off millions of dollars of investments in FTX.As a result of these tax deductions, there should be a bit of a chill in institutional investment into the crypto space as public pensions in particular are scrutinized for their allocations. This chill is also spilling over into retail investors spooked by the swoon in token prices and the wave of bankruptcy filings.Publicly traded crypto stocks such as Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the Coinbase crypto exchange, have experienced declines in value of nearly 90% from their 52-week peak. While many crypto stocks may have been overvalued during retail investors’ digital gold rush, today’s stock pickers may find opportunities for valuation expansion in some companies.Sign up: Introducing Our First Newsletter Course: Learn Crypto InvestingDespite the recent swoon in token prices, rising uncertainty about their future trajectory and even the doubts about the current crop of crypto tokens’ long-term viability, it might not be such a bad idea just to buy the tokens themselves, according to recent research from the CFA Institute.Over the past 12 to 18 months, crypto critics have seized upon token prices’ growing correlations to U.S. equity indexes, particularly large-capitalization indexes like the S&P 500 and sector funds like XLK, the iShares ETF covering the U.S. technology sector.The CFA Institute, in researching asset prices from the past three years, dispelled some of these concerns by finding that five of the largest crypto tokens – BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP and ADA – have relatively weak correlations compared to a full range of equity style indexes and sector ETFs. While the correlation is still positive – when the indexes go up or down the tokens follow in the same direction – it's not a one-to-one correlation.“Cryptocurrencies’ low positive correlation with mutual funds and ETFs may indicate an increase in cross-market trading and signal crypto’s growing popularity,” wrote the CFA Institute’s researchers.“Moreover, in a rising interest rate environment and amid the diminished efficacy of the traditional 60/40 equity/bond portfolio, crypto’s weak correlation to traditional assets may offer potential diversification benefits for long-horizon investors who can withstand added short-term volatility. Not all cryptocurrencies display the same lack of correlation to traditional assets, however, so investors need to be discerning about which ones they target.”",2022/12/01

255,"It's still winter in the digital-assets market, and yet crypto Twitter is going bottom fishing.And why not, as bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has recently bounced 10% to over $17,000 despite lingering FTX contagion fears and crypto lender BlockFi filing for bankruptcy.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday signaled that the central bank could slow the pace of its liquidity-sucking interest rate hikes starting this month. Popular technical analysis indicators signal downtrend exhaustion in bitcoin.Some experts, however, called for caution as bitcoin's price action is yet to satisfy all conditions necessary to confirm a bear market bottom and a bullish revival.""As we have seen three attempts this year that eventually failed, we need to wait for bitcoin prices to trade above their 21-week moving average ($20,851) in order to call for a sustainable rally and a cyclical low,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto-services provider Matrixport, said.Bottom fishing refers to investing in an asset with a substantial price decline. The high-risk, high-reward approach is based on the assumption that the asset is undervalued and due for a reversal higher.Bitcoin turned lower from its 21-week moving average in early November and fell to a two-year low of $15,460 on Coinbase. The late March attempt to scale the average also paved the way for a deeper sell-off.Therefore, a convincing move above the average is needed to confirm a bottom.According to Caleb Franzen, founder of research firm and newsletter Cubic Analytics, a bull revival would be confirmed once bitcoin prints a positive ""Heikin-Ashi"" candle on the monthly chart.Heikin-Ashi and traditional candlesticks are constructed using an asset's open, high, low and close prices for a specific period. Heikin-Ashi, however, is an averaged version of traditional candlesticks. Therefore, it helps cut through the noise and facilitates better gauging of trend reversals than traditional candles.""After 5+ months of red candles, a green monthly candle has [historically] marked the end of each bear market,"" Franzen tweeted Monday, calling for patience on the part of the bulls as bitcoin produced its 12th consecutive red monthly Heikin-Ashi candle in November.The latest red streak on the monthly Heikin-Ashi chart is the second longest on record. Bitcoin produced 14 straight red candles from February 2018 to March 2019 before confirming a bull revival with a green candle in April 2019.At press time, bitcoin changed hands at $17,080, a 0.5% drop on the day.The cryptocurrency's weekly chart shows a bullish divergence of the relative strength index, a popular technical analysis tool used to gauge overbought and oversold conditions.A bullish divergence occurs when the RSI doesn't confirm a new low/cyclical price low. In other words, while the price goes down, the RSI remains steady or goes up.Chart analysts and traders consider it an early sign of an impending positive trend change.""It's interesting to note that the relative strength index peaked already in January 2021 for this cycle and did not confirm bitcoin's second top in 22. Now, this indicator also signals that the downturn may have fully played out,"" Thielen said in a note to clients on Wednesday.",2022/12/01

A spokesperson for the province's utility confirmed the news to CoinDesk via email.Manitoba Hydro is to stop processing new and existing applications from crypto mining operations looking to connecting to the grid until April 30, 2024, according to a Nov. 16 government directive. The directive also calls on Manitoba Hydro to review how the crypto mining industry affects the grid and engage with the Public Utilities Board as well as the government's finance department and to come up with a regulatory proposal.The existing 37 mining facilities will not be affected, according to the reports.Miners have flocked to Canada for its cheap electricity, with Manitoba having the second-cheapest electricity rates in the country after Quebec, according to reports.Manitoba Hydro has a capacity of about 6.1 gigawatts (GW), and if ""every cryptocurrency operator who has shown interest in the last 16 months,"" was connected to the grid, the total load would increase by 4.6 GW across 240 operations, a spokesperson for the utility told CoinDesk.""There are currently 37 cryptocurrency customers in the province of Manitoba, but over 240 potential new operations have been in touch with Manitoba Hydro since July 2021,"" the spokesperson added.Manitoba Hydro's debt has tripled in the last 15 years as it took on loans to built two new mega projects totaling CAD3.7 billion (US$2.75 billion), Keeyask and the Bipole III transmission line.

Bankman-Fried spoke in generalities, often looking down at the floor as the Times' uber-reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin peppered him with questions. ""I didn't ever try to commit fraud,"" Bankman-Fried said at one point.Cryptos' upswing was small compared to equity markets, which soared on Powell's remarks at the Brookings Institution's Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Washington, D.C., that the Fed would likely raise interest rates 50 basis points (BPS) instead of continuing its recent diet of 75 bps increases. Investors were also heartened by the U.S.'s third quarter GDP, which grew 2.9%, up from the Commerce Department's original 2.6% estimate.DFD Partners' Little was pessimistic about crypto prices continuing to climb, saying that bitcoin would likely sink to the $12,000 to $13,000 level before topping $22,000, a level it last reached in October. ""It's going to be on the back of what are the other contagion impacts, around this particular event, FTX"" he said. ""Different providers are going to struggle to not only meet liquidity demands but also counter-party risk.""The Failure of Blockchain-Based Enterprise SoftwareBy Sam ReynoldsRewind to the last crypto bear market, and the narrative of ""enterprise blockchain"" was driving the recovery. Although this funny internet money was subject to booms and busts, the programmability of blockchain technology was supposed to unlock trillions of dollars of real value. Beijing had identified it as a strategic technology, after all.But despite the $3.1 trillion in unlocked value that Gartner promised by 2030, industry use cases for blockchain continue to fade away.Recently, Maersk and IBM announced that TradeLens, the blockchain-based transparent ledger that was supposed to improve freight processing and customs clearance, will be wound down in 2023.“TradeLens has not reached the level of commercial viability necessary to continue work and meet the financial expectations as an independent business,” Maersk Head of Business Platforms Rotem Hershko said in a statement.Keywords: commercial viability. This seems to be the theme with enterprise blockchain applications. Executives aren’t able to determine why we need this as opposed to more traditional database technology.Earlier this month, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) said it was canceling a planned blockchain-based upgrade to its clearing house system. The existing system was performing well enough, and executives at the bourse couldn’t justify spending on a system upgrade that might not do much more than its predecessor.Amazon: Why blockchain?Tim Bray, one of the godfathers of web software development, offers an anecdote about all this on his blog. Until early 2020, Bray was a vice president at Amazon Web Services (AWS) beforere signing as a high-profile defector, vocally criticizing Amazon for its “vein of toxicity.”In 2016, presumably during happier times in his career at the company, Bray was in a meeting with Andy Jassy, then-CEO of AWS, and the topic was blockchain. Bray writes (the entire post is worth reading) that Jassy was hearing from his clients that AWS needed a blockchain strategy. But Jassy couldn’t understand why blockchain was necessary when existing tools provided sufficient solutions.AWS was already making a ton of money from blockchain. Many of the world’s crypto exchanges or other infrastructure projects host their products on the platform (see: the $4.6 million AWS bill to Alameda/FTX). But this is different than what the world’s industrial and commercial giants were being told they wanted. They needed to integrate blockchain, investors said, and it was up to AWS to implement this.“I can’t remember the details of how our findings got back to Andy. They were of the form 'Ledgers are useful, cryptography tech is useful, blockchains aren’t, the field is full of grifters, but we could build distributed-ledger infrastructure and then these cool services on top of it,’” Bray wrote. “I’m not prepared to say that no blockchain-based system will ever be useful for anything. But I’m gonna stay negative until I see one actually at work doing something useful, without number-go-up greedheads clamped on its teats.”AWS still has a blockchain segment, and is said to be in the process of preparing to double down on China, the only market where enterprise blockchain continues to exist at scale because of state diktat (where’s the on-chain data?).Meanwhile, its competitor, Microsoft Azure, has shuttered its cloud blockchain services. As CoinDesk reported last year, IBM’s blockchain division is a “shell of its former self.”Bray noted in his post that it wasn’t the role of AWS to “ascertain market realities.” They needed to build what the customer wanted. Jaffy, the executive in charge of the division, was “possibly the world’s single most accomplished person at listening to people talk about Enterprise IT problems and the tools needed to fix them,” and if he couldn’t see the value of this technology, it probably wasn’t worth anyone’s time.But at the time, if you questioned the technology, you were a “peasant,” as Bray noted, because all the ""Serious Enterprises full of Serious People” were about to adopt blockchain.And now, those that did are abandoning it.Let’s just admit that it was all a failure.3:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:00 UTC) Germany's Retail Sales (YoY/Oct)9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Bank of Japan Governor Kuroda speech11:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(15:00 UTC) United States ISM Manufacturing PMI (Nov)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Rises Toward $17K; BlockFi Has $355M in Crypto Frozen on FTXCrypto lender BlockFi has about $355 million in cryptocurrencies currently frozen on defunct crypto exchange FTX.

258,"Andrew Ross Sorkin of the New York Times interviewed former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried on Nov. 30 at the DealBook Summit. What follows is a transcript of that conversation.Read CoinDesk's coverage of the interview here.Andrew Ross Sorkin (ARS): In the span of about one week, Sam Bankman-Fried went from a billionaire, the white knight of the crypto world and running one of the largest exchanges, to what some people think has become a wanted man. FTX was once valued at $32 billion. It's now effectively worthless in bankruptcy. We're going to talk about that and whether investors will ever get money back. There are multiple billions owed to creditors and big questions. In the wake of the collapse bitcoin fell to its lowest price in two years, and on Monday, BlockFi, which had been bailed out by FTX, filed for bankruptcy. The rapid fall of this empire has left so many questions about crypto, about the future of it and whether it can be trusted again. Sam Bankman-Fried joins us right now, live from the Bahamas.Sam, I want to thank you for joining us this afternoon. I appreciate your willingness to have this conversation. As I said at the outset of today, there are a lot of questions that need to be asked and also need to be answered.As you know, a lot of people have been hurt, genuinely hurt. And my hope is that over the time we have together, that we can have a candid conversation about what happened, how it happened. There are people who are angry and they are seeking answers. I just want everybody in the audience to know that I received thousands of letters and emails, even the past couple days, from a lot of these people who feel like they're victims, and some of them have questioned whether we should have this conversation, whether we should have this interview. There are people who don't believe that this conversation should happen. And I just want to say that I think our job as journalists is to have those conversations, is to ask those questions and seek those answers on behalf of the public. And that is especially true right now.Sam, here's where I want to start this conversation, if we could. I think at this point, there are two ways to view what has happened at FTX. And I know we'll get into all of the details in a moment. But I'm just gonna go very basic. There's a generous view. And the generous view is that you are a young man who made a series of terrible, terrible very, very bad decisions. The less generous view is that you have committed a massive fraud, that this is a Ponzi scheme, a manipulation of the system. And I want to start there because I think that there's so many people who have that question, which is what is this and what did happen?Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF): Yeah, look, thanks for having me. And at the end of the day, I was CEO of FTX and that means whatever happened, why ever it happened, I had a duty. I had a duty to all of our stakeholders, to our customers, our creditors, I had a duty to our employees, to our investors and to the regulators of the world to do right by them, to make sure the right things happened to the company and clearly I didn't do a good job with that. Clearly, I – I made a lot of mistakes or things I would give anything to be able to do over again. I didn't ever try to commit fraud on anyone. I, I was excited about the prospects of FTX a month ago. I saw it as a thriving, growing business. I was shocked by what happened this month. And, you know, reconstructing it, were there things I wish I had done differently.ARS: Well, let's talk about some of the things you, you would want to have done differently. But I don't want this to be an abstraction for folks because it's a lot of big numbers, and often doesn't feel human. One of the letters I got I want to read to you, Sam, because it's from a gentleman who said that he lost his life savings. And the subject line is, ""Sam Bankman-Fried stole $2 million from me."" It says, ""Andrew, can you please ask SBF why he decided to steal my life savings and the $10 billion more from customers to give to his hedge fund Alameda. Can you ask him why his hedge fund was leveraging long all of these s-coins?"" I'm gonna keep it polite for the kids. ""Please ask him if he thinks what happened was fraud."" These are the kinds of letters that I've been getting repeatedly over the past several days. What do you tell this man?SBF: Yeah, I mean, I'm deeply sorry about what happened. You know, for the long and short of what happened – and I'll start by saying just to make a distinction here – you look at the U.S. platform, you look at the international platform, U.S. platform is a U.S.-regulated platform with American users. To my knowledge that's fully solvent, that's fully funded and, you know, I believe that withdrawals could be opened up today and everyone could be made whole from that, that none of these problems plagued the U.S. platform.Then you look at the international platform, for their non-U.S. users. And, I mean, as the letter says, Alameda Research did have a long position. And, you know, the international platform, it's a margin-trading platform. It's a derivatives platform. It's a platform where all the clients were, you know, going on placing something as collateral and using that to put on a position, whether that's a futures position, a spot position, a borrow. And, you know, what the exchange is storing was the collateral from all of those positions. Alameda Research was one of those that put on positions there. And as I try and reconstruct this, you know, over the last month, I have limited access to data, but my, my, my, my view of it, from what I have been able to see is roughly that, you know, basically, look, a year ago Alameda had, I think, something like 10% leverage, had something like 10 times the assets of the position that it had on.Over the course of the last year there were a number of market crashes that drove the value of those assets down and the leverage up. I think it was, to my knowledge, still under 2x leverage, you know, as of a month ago. You look at what happened this month and, you know, in a few days an all-out. I mean, PR assault, which led to a total market collapse in a pretty short period of time, no bid-side liquidity. I think more than $10 billion wiped off in the matter of days, and, realistically speaking, no ability for FTX to be able to, to liquidate that position and generate everything that was owed from it.ARS: But I think the bigger question is where Alameda got the loan from, which is to say that there is a view that this is about commingling of funds. And in that letter that I just read you, this gentleman actually copied and pasted the terms of service for FTX into the email and I just want to read you this. It says, ""None of the digital assets in your account are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, FTX Trading. FTX Trading does not represent or treat digital assets and users' accounts as belonging to FTX Trading."" So how is it possible that Alameda had this loan of such a large size?SBF: So, there's that piece from the terms of service. But there were a number of other parts of the terms of service and there's a number of other parts of the platform on top of that. There is the borrower lending facility where users were lending billions of dollars of assets to each other, you know, collateralized by assets on the exchange. You had, obviously, futures contracts where they are leveraged positions on. Now, of course, all of this, it's meant to be the case that these are positions where FTX could, if it needed to, margin call those positions and close them down in time such that it would cover all of those, all of those shorts, all of those liabilities. Obviously, that wasn't the case here. And that's a massive failure of oversight of risk management, and of a huge diffusion of responsibility from, from myself running FTX.ARS: But just make this very straight, was there commingling of funds? That's what it appears like. It appears like there's a genuine commingling of the funds that are of FTX customers' that were not supposed to be commingled with your separate firm.SBF: I didn't knowingly commingle funds. And, again, one piece of this, you have the margin trading. You have, you know, customers borrowing from each other. Alameda is one of those. I was frankly surprised by how big Alameda's position was, which points to another failure of oversight on my part. And a failure to appoint someone to be chiefly in charge of that. But I wasn't trying to commingle funds.ARS: Well, let me ask you this: The Wall Street Journal reported that [Alameda Research CEO] Caroline Ellison told Alameda staffers that Alameda used FTX client funds to cover loans that were being recalled because of the LUNA-triggered credit crunch. Caroline says that she, Sam, Gary were aware of this. How do you square that with what you originally said over Twitter, that this was an $8 billion accounting mistake?SBF: So, I'll point to two things. And first of all, obviously, I don't know what anyone else is thinking here. You know, I can only talk about it from what I know, from what I knew. And a lot of this is reconstructing it over the last month. I have limited access to data, but, you know, what it seems like happened is in the middle of the year, a lot of – most of the borrow-lending desks in this space blew out or closed down. And it seems like Alameda had, you know, margin positions opened with them, and that it likely moved a bunch of that over to FTX this year when they shut down. And that means, you know, I think it was over-collateralized positions, but positions that involve substantial size and substantial U.S. dollar size on the borrow side.In terms of the accounting mistake, again, looking through what happened, I think that there is a substantial discrepancy between what the financials were – what the audited financials were – the true financials – what the exchange understood. All of that was, was, was consistent. Versus what the dashboards that we had displayed for, for Alameda's account there, which substantially under-displayed the size of that position. And, so, that's one of the reasons I was surprised when we dug into everything at, at how big that position had become.ARS: But you would agree that there is a much more closely connected version of FTX international and Alameda than previously understood. Fair to say?SBF: Yeah, I mean, given the size of the position, I think it was, if not in intention, it was in effect tied together substantially more than I would have ever wanted it to be.ARS: So, you did an interview earlier this summer with Bloomberg, and you were asked about the connection between Alameda and FTX, and you said that ""obviously came from the, the same place because it started that way and the same original people, but most of the remaining nexuses,"" you said, ""have dropped off.""SBF: Yep.ARS: ""I know the people from Alameda decently well,"" almost as if you don't know what's happening there. ""And there isn't, like, a large amount, you know, of ways remain that we are actively working together, anything like that. Alameda is a wholly separate entity. They're different offices, like, different principal offices, we don't have any shared personnel. We're also not the same company. We not all are under the same corporate umbrella or anything like that."" And yet it seems like Alameda people were living in the same penthouse, where you may very well be right now, all together.SBF: Most of Alameda was not, was not there. I don't live there now. But – or, you know, not there now – I have not lived there for most of the time. But, you know, I did live with, with, with one or two members of Alameda for a little while. And also I'll say that, you know, as I was, earlier this summer, looking at the relationship – and this is a pretty big mistake in oversight of mine – I was viewing it primarily from the trading volume perspective, because that's what drives our revenue. And so when I was looking at how intertwined are FTX and Alameda, you know, I was looking at, well, what what fraction of trading volume, what fraction of liquidity on the platform does Alameda represent. That had fallen off from something like 45% in 2019 to something like 2% this year, but in terms of positions and balances, it was a much larger fraction. I hadn't been looking at that. That's a pretty big oversight.ARS: But, Sam, I think the question is whether you were supposed to have access to these accounts to begin with, you know? If, if I worked at a bank and was a bank teller, and I decided to leave the bank at the end of the evening and take the cash that I ostensibly had access to, even if I intended to bring it back to the bank later even with more money to give them back, I still stole the money.SBF: I mean, look, I wasn't running Alameda. I didn't know exactly what was going on. I didn't know the size of their position. A lot of these are things that I've learned over the last month that I learned as I was sort of frantically digging into this on Nov. 6, Nov. 7, Nov. 8. And, and, obviously, that, that's a pretty big mistake [unintelligible]. That's a pretty big oversight that I wasn't more aware. I think I was, you know, scared of – I was nervous because of the conflict of interest about being too involved. And, obviously, that shouldn't have meant that I didn't have real oversight, or that really shouldn't have meant that I failed to appoint anyone to be in charge of that oversight, that relationship. But I, I haven't been running Alameda, I haven't been thinking about its finances. I haven't been, you know, making those decisions. But, you know, as CEO of FTX it was still my duty to make sure I was doing diligence.ARS: But you owned it.SBF: I was, I was a large owner of it. That is true. And I, I had a lot of exposure on that side.ARS: So why haven't you been focused on it, if, in fact, that's actually where the profits were?SBF: Well, I don't know that that's where – I mean, I think Alameda had made trading profits over the last few years, but FTX had made profits as well. FTX had been a profitable, growing business. And I was – that was more than a full-time job. I didn't have the bandwidth to run two companies at once. I didn't have the, you know, attention for it. And, again, I was nervous about a conflict of interest between those two, and so was pretty intentional about not being very involved in what was happening at Alameda.ARS: When did the commingling of assets begin?SBF: So, and, again, you know, lots of traders had open margin positions on FTX, where they would have borrows of assets where they would be short some asset against, you know, against other assets as collateral. That being said, I, again, looking through this now, I think that that position size for Alameda got substantially larger over the course of 2022. And that it was, I think, substantially larger by October 2022 – probably by July of '22 – than it had been in April.ARS: But it sounds like it's fair to say that there was always a connection between Alameda and FTX and almost – I mean, not almost, but from the very, very beginning – and then it never really stopped.SBF: Well, I think it had been, in some ways, reducing. I mean, when you scroll back to 2019, Alameda and FTX were very connected in a number of ways. You know, one of these was that Alameda was the primary liquidity provider on FTX. It was, you know, 40-something percent of volume. It was the backstop liquidity provider. And, you know, you scroll forward to 2022, it was down to 2% of volume. We had a lot of backstop liquidity providers. But it still had a big margin position on, and I, I was failing to pay nearly enough attention to positions and positional risk on the exchange and to Alameda's in particular. And I also, frankly, made a mistake that I feel pretty embarrassed to have made – and a lot of these are – but I substantially underestimated what the scale of a market crash could look like, and what the speed of it could look like. And how correlated it would be.ARS: But that just suggests that you were just hoping, perhaps hoping against hope, that this would all work out and that nobody, therefore, would realize what this commingling was all about?SBF: So, it's not how I viewed it. And, in particular, again, most of the firms had margin positions. Most of the firms had borrows on FTX. The problem here, this one was, this was too big. It was – I was surprised by that size of what it was.ARS: But it's not just too big. It's, it's, it's assets that, look, it sounds like there were assets that, that may have been allowable to be loaned. But then there were assets that weren't allowable to be loaned, no?SBF: So, I'm still looking into the details of some pieces of this. But I do think that in addition to what I had seen as sort of lot of the standard borrows here, that we scroll back to 2018 or to 2019, I guess, FTX didn't have bank accounts. It didn't have any bank accounts globally. We were trying to get them. It took us a while, it took us a few years, and, you know, there are customers who wanted to wire money to FTX. And so I think in the meantime, some of them were wiring money to Alameda Research to get credited on FTX, and I think that was a substantial sum. And I think that the FTX's internal accounting did correctly, effectively try to debit Alameda for those funds, but it didn't happen in the primary account and so it didn't happen. It created a discrepancy between the display of the account and what was really going on there. And I'm still looking into exactly how that, how that worked mechanically. But I – that, that did make that position size substantially larger than, than I thought and I think than what you would have gotten from, from most normal avenues.ARS: What do you make of the argument that Alameda was used to effectively wash money into FTX. That American investors, who, by the way, were not technically allowed to even invest on FTX, were doing so and FTX was doing it knowingly because the, the know-your-customer rules were being flouted by using this separate vehicle.SBF: How would that allow customers to flout the know-your-customer rules? Are you talking about people who are trading on FTX US or are you talking about customers of FTX international?ARS: International. You just said that there was money being sent to Alameda, and that Alameda was then providing credits onto FTX.SBF: Right. But those users still had to go through the know-your-customer policy on FTX in order to do that. In order to use that ramp, customers still had to go through FTX's normal KYC onboarding.ARS: So, when do you think you knew there was a problem?SBF: So, the time that I really knew there was a problem was Nov. 6. Nov. 6 was – that was the date that the tweet about FTT came out. And by late on Nov. 6, we were putting together all of the data, putting together all the information that obviously should have put together way earlier – that obviously should have been part of the dashboards I was always looking at. And I, you know, when we looked at that, there was a potential serious problem there. And, you know, Alameda's position was big on FTX. It had just taken a huge hit. It had taken hits over the course of the year, but that was a particularly large one and very abrupt. And we're seeing a run on the bank start and that was leading to $4 billion a day of client withdrawals. At that point, you know, we started calling prospective, you know, sources of financing, because I was, I was nervous about what was going to happen there. You know, if you rewind even a few days, I was, I was a little bit nervous, but not on nearly the same scale and I, I was thinking about, you know, risks that were substantially less.ARS: When you say you were nervous, you were nervous the company was gonna go under? You were nervous you were gonna get caught? What were you nervous about?SBF: On, like, on Nov. 6 or before then?ARS: Either.SBF: So, I think, before then what I was nervous about was that basically – and this started, I would say Nov. 2 or so when there was the leak of the Alameda balance sheet through CoinDesk. And when I started to think a bit more about this, you know, I was nervous that that would lead to substantial losses for Alameda and that, you know, it would be a bit messy. I didn't think it was existential for FTX. I didn't think it was going to lead to a massive loss for FTX's customers. I was thinking of this as more like Alameda is gonna to be really tight on funds and that, you know, maybe it would end up having some small impact on FTX, but not, not a significant one, not one that hurt customers at all. When you're talking about Nov. 6 – late Nov. 6 – then and, and especially as we bleed into Nov. 7 and 8, I start to become nervous that FTX is not going to be able to fulfill customer withdrawals. And, you know, by late Nov. 6, I am very nervous about that. And I'm starting to think about, like, emergency scenarios and I'm starting to think about, like, things might, things might end quite badly here. And, and, and the core metric that I'm thinking of there is will we be able to make sure all customers are whole. And, you know, on Nov. 5, I was feeling quite good about that. On Nov. 7, I was feeling quite uneasy about that.ARS: I want to go back in time for a moment. This summer you were described oftentimes as the J.P. Morgan of crypto, referencing the 1907 panic that he helped prevent. And you had purchased BlockFi, were making investments in Voyager and all sorts of other things. When you were doing that, at that time, how much of that was an effort to prop up the value of things like FTT, which was the token of FTX, knowing that if a company like BlockFi, which owed a ton of it, that if it collapsed FTT would collapse and in large part, the ""collateral"" that you had for Alameda would collapse.SBF: So, I don't think any of the borrow-lending desks, to my knowledge, owned a lot of FTT. I think a lot of them, you know, may have been using it as collateral – or, you know, taking it as collateral. I don't think they owned it though or were gonna sell it. And I think that most of them ended up closing down effectively all of their lines with Alameda one way or another. And so at that point, I think that that was close to a sunk cost and so I wasn't viewing it as having any impact on FTT in particular. I did view it as important for the industry's health. I did view it as a thing where I wanted to try to keep the industry stable, but I don't think it had any, you know, really large FTT-specific impact.ARS: And did it have – you didn't think it had any impact – it would have no impact on Alameda or FTX if, for example, BlockFi were to have failed.SBF: I don't think it would have had a large direct impact and the reason I say that is that I believe that Alameda ended up returning the vast majority of its open, you know, borrows of its margin positions with the borrow-lending desks in the middle of this year anyway. And so at that point, there wasn't that much left to save from that. You know, the – at that point, I think the bigger thing was just not wanting the industry to implode.ARS: Let's talk about collateral. Because I think this is – this entire experience has been a revelation for a lot of people about what might be collateral. And clearly you were using FTT and Solana and other tokens as collateral, and part of that required you to mark them in a specific way – a value to them.SBF: Yep.ARS: Do you think that you were marking them properly?SBF: In Alameda's case, I don't think I was marking them the way I wish I had from a risk perspective. And I want to sort of differentiate your, like, expected value or, or sort of, like, worth or something like that from security. And, you know, I think that I don't have any strong statements to make about, you know, what value they're assigned from sort of, like, an upside perspective or even a median case perspective. But clearly, I was, I was not nearly cautious enough from a downside perspective – from the extreme downside perspective. And, you know, I can tell you, in my head, I was looking at a 30% down move over a few-day period as a sort of, like, extreme tail-case event that, you know, we had seen once before, and, and then, you know, what happened here was, I mean, a 95% down move over the course of a year, and a, you know, 60% down move over a few-day period with very little liquidity and all happening at once in all of these coins in a correlated fashion in which hedges didn't mean as much also because this was a specific crash on assets associated with Alameda Research, rather than all assets. And so even correlated hedges had limited use there, and a run on the bank at the same time. And all that are things, in retrospect, I should have expected might happen in an extreme scenario, because that's how markets work. And, you know, we've seen other examples of that in history where, when things get really bad, they get really bad for all the relevant things at once, in a very direct and correlated and quick way.ARS: I want to go to the BlockFi acquisition for a moment. How much money do you think Alameda – I'd say that they had a lot of FTT but – that Alameda had borrowed from BlockFi at the time of the bailout?SBF: I honestly don't know, but I, I would have guessed, like, $100 million, maybe couple hundred million, but I, I, I honestly don't know the answer – I wasn't, I wasn't, like, paying detailed attention. That's my guess.ARS: And were you using FTT and Serum and other things to collateralize the loans at BlockFi, do you think? I mean, this goes to the whole idea of both the value of these things and also whether you were trying to buy BlockFi, in fact, to continue to support effectively Alameda over FTX.SBF: Right, you know, it might be, I would guess it was but, but, you know, to your point, my guess is that, like, the amount paid for, for BlockFi is probably bigger than the amount that Alameda had opened with it. I mean, I don't know that for sure, again, I – but I wasn't even looking at what that number was really. But I think that's, that's about right.ARS: I want to go back to the Alameda piece of it for just another moment, if you'd stick with me here. You had told investors and regulators that you were not involved in Alameda decision-making. And yet, in the case – Alameda invested $1.15 billion in Genesis Digital Assets without your consultation or approval – that's the question. And my understanding is you also served on the board of Genesis Digital Assets. And so I'm trying to understand how you wouldn't have been involved with Alameda?SBF: So, I was somewhat involved with venture investing and that was done out of a separate entity than, you know, any of Alameda's proprietary trading, than its activity on FTX or other crypto exchanges. But I was consulted on, on some of its, its VC investments, including with GDA.ARS: What are your lawyers telling you right now? Are they suggesting this is a good idea for you to be speaking?SBF: No, they're very much not. And, I mean, you know, the classic advice, right? Don't say anything. You know, recede into a hole. And it's not who I am. I mean, it's not who I want to be. I don't have – I, I have a duty to talk to people. I have a duty to explain what happened. And I think I have a duty to do everything I can to try and do what's right if there anything I can do to try and help customers out here, and I don't see what good is accomplished by me just sitting locked, you know, in a room pretending the outside world doesn't exist.ARS: You're in the Bahamas right now. Are you in the Bahamas because you think you can't leave?SBF: No. I'm in the Bahamas. I mean, I have been in the Bahamas for the last year and, you know, I've been running FTX from the Bahamas. You know, I've been running FTX Digital Market, our, you know, primary operating entity down here, you know, with the Bahamian regulators and, and others in, in, in contact and I, you know, right now, I'm, you know, looking to be helpful anywhere I can with any of the global entities that, you know, that would want my help.ARS: Do you think you could come to the United States or go elsewhere?SBF: To my knowledge I could.ARS: Have you thought about doing that?SBF: I've thought about it and, you know, I mean, I've seen a lot of the, obviously, a lot of the hearings that have been happening. I would, you know, not be surprised if, you know, sometime I am, you know, up there talking about what happened to our representatives or, you know, wherever else is, is most appropriate.ARS: How concerned are you about criminal liability at this point?SBF: So, I don't think that, I mean, obviously, I don't, I don't personally think that I have, you know – but I, I think the real answer is that it's not – sounds weird to say but, but – I think the real answer is that's not what I'm focusing on. It's – there's gonna be a time and a place for me to sort of think about myself and my own future, but I don't think this is it, like, right now. I mean, look, I've had a bad month. [Audience laughs.] This has not been a fun month for me. But that's not what matters here. Like, what matters here is the millions of customers. What matters here is all the stakeholders in FTX who, who got hurt, and, and trying to do everything I can to help them out. And, you know, as long as that's the case, like, I don't think that, I don't think that, you know, what happens to me is the important part of that. And I don't think that's what it makes sense for me to be focusing on.ARS: Sam, help me with this. On Nov. 7, you tweeted, and then deleted, a tweet that said, ""FTX has enough to cover all client holdings. We don't invest client assets, even treasuries. We've been processing all withdrawals and will continue to be."" You then deleted that tweet and literally just moments ago, you told me it was on Nov. 7 that things took a turn.SBF: Yep.ARS: You're telling the truth?SBF: So, things were changing fast. And, you know, when you look at Nov. 6, I was feeling nervous, but I felt like things were probably going to end up OK. We still had, I mean, you know, assets way larger than liabilities and, yeah, there's increasing withdrawal demand, but we were meeting all of it. We were processing all of it, although it was a weekend so we were a day delayed on a lot of wire transfers and stablecoin creations and the Bitcoin node was overloaded, but, you know, their assets were continuing to process. By Nov. 8, I did not think the odds were that high that we were gonna be able to meet all client demand and, and I was worried that there was going to be a substantial liquidity shortfall. Nov. 7, that was sort of the transition day and, you know, even just the start versus the end of Nov. 7, I felt fairly different, you know. And I can't remember exactly what I was thinking or, or, or, or when I sent that but, you know, I remember trying to think about feeling conflicted about what to say and trying to think about what I could say that I believed and, you know, by, by not that long later, I no longer believed that. I no longer – that no longer felt like it had much, like – that was a, a at all reasonable representation of where my mind was at. And I don't remember exactly when I deleted it. But I remember at some point, I was, like, that shouldn't be there.ARS: Let me ask a different question, because this is all around the same time. The New York Times reported that $515 million was ""suspiciously"" transferred from FTX wallets after – after ...SBF: Yeah.ARS: ... the bankruptcy filing.SBF: Yes.ARS: And there have been accusations that this is the assistance, effectively, of theft. Where did that money go?SBF: So, I will caveat this by saying at that point, I was being cut off from systems. And so I'll give you the answer to the extent that I know it, which is that I believe that a few different things happened within a short period there. I think that the U.S. team took actions to seize some of the assets, and put it in custody, from the exchange. I believe the – it has been announced that, you know, the Bahamian regulators took some of the assets into safekeeping as well around that same time. And I think there is, in addition to both of those, there's also been some actually improper access of assets on the exchange. And I don't know the details of that. I don't have the resources to trace through exactly what happened there. And I don't know who is behind that third part.ARS: I want to go back to one thing about the Bahamas. The Bahamian authorities have now admitted, effectively, that they ordered the transfer, it sounds like, of certain FTX assets to wallets under its control, after the U.S. bankruptcy was filed. Did you help them with that? Did you discuss that with them?SBF: So, I, I can't discuss specifics, but I will note that prior to Chapter 11 having been filed, the Bahamian authorities had placed FTX Digital Markets, the Bahamian entity, which is the primary operating entity of FTX international, under supervision of a JPL system in the Bahamas with oversight from the Securities Commission of the Bahamas. And, you know, were, to my knowledge, taking actions to protect FDM's clients and, and customers there.ARS: Can we just go back for just one second, and I apologize for belaboring this point, but we're talking about FTX and the derivative piece of it earlier. And I had made a note earlier about this, because you had told the Senate – you were sitting in the Senate at the time on Feb. 9, 2022, during a hearing – and you said, ""On FTX US Derivatives, all of these contracts are fully collateralized."" Was that true?SBF: Yes. And, again, FTX US, to my knowledge, totally solvent. FTX US Derivatives, totally solvent, and, in fact, I believe FTX US Derivatives, LedgerX, may even be up and running right now. I'm confused why FTX US is not processing customer withdrawals right now. I would think it should be because I believe, to my knowledge, that it could be and could make all Americans 100% whole from this. So, and FTX US Derivatives, as I said there, doesn't even allow leverage of any sort. It was, you know, close to a spot trading platform. And so, yeah, to my knowledge, all American customers and all American-regulated businesses and exchanges here are, I think, at least in terms of client assets, are, are, are OK. Obviously, I don't know what's happened with, you know – you can make your own judgments about the enterprise value of those businesses, but ...ARS: Over the summer you paid a $2.5 billion loan to Barry Silbert's Genesis [Editor's note: Genesis Global Trading is owned by Silbert's Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk]. This was in August. And I was just trying to think through the dynamics of what might have been happening at your firm and was wondering where did the money come from?SBF: So, when you say ""you"" did that, I presume that that's Alameda Research that did that, is that right?ARS: Yes, that's the case.SBF: So, I don't have all of the details there, but my understanding is that – and I don't know exactly what was going on on Genesis' side then, and I don't know now – but my understanding is I believe Genesis tried to call in a large number of loans from Alameda. I believe that that happened, and that that closed down a lot of positions that Alameda had opened with Genesis and other trading desks. And, you know, that was what I was thinking at the time. And that's what I think happened there. I also think that may have led to an increase of position size of Alameda on FTX, in retrospect.ARS: You did an interview, I think, perhaps, inadvertently, over Twitter DMs ...SBF: Oh, boy.ARS: ... with a reporter at Vox and had spoken about ESG, but also about what you described as the shibboleths of what it meant to look good in corporate America today and that a lot of the things that you were doing were not necessarily things you actually believed or believed in. Can you speak to that?SBF: Yeah, absolutely. And I was a – a frustrating experience. It was not meant to be a, a public interview. It was a longtime friend of mine who I stupidly forgot was also a reporter. I thought I was speaking in a personal capacity. I'm not sure what they thought the capacity was at the time, but it certainly ended up being reported on. And, you know, I think what I would say is, look, there are a lot of things that I think have really massive impact on the world. And, ultimately, that's what I care about the most. And, I mean, I think that, I think frankly, that, that, you know, the blockchain industry could, could have substantial positive impact, but, you know, I, I was thinking a lot about, you know, bed nets and malaria, about, you know, saving people from diseases no one should die from, the animal welfare, about pandemic prevention. And, you know, what could be done on a large scale to help mitigate those. Those things I think matter and, and, and there's, you know, among the most important things to me. Separately from that, there is a bunch of bullshit that regulated companies do to try and look good. And these are things that everyone who does them basically knows they're kind of dumb, that these are not things that are making large impact on the world. These are not looking at saving thousands of lives. You know, these are the kinds of, like, you know – if it's like three different quarterbacks throw a touchdown in the same game for the same team, we'll donate two used cars to charity-type campaigns where it's not gonna happen. It's never happened. There's no expectation of a car getting donated. It's just a PR campaign sort of masquerading as do-gooderism. And, you know, things like greenwashing are, are things which, I think, end up in a similar area.ARS: Fair to say you participated in this?SBF: Yeah, we all did. And, and I, I, I and, you know, FTX did as well. And there are things I felt like we needed to do for the business. There are things that I felt like were, were crucial for us being able – I mean – I wish the world didn't work this way. I wish that these weren't relevant to your ability to get regulated, to your ability to get bank accounts, but they they, they were and I – yeah, you know, we had promotional campaigns, we had, you know, marketing slogans and, you know, we thought about what we could do to – and, you know, we thought of ourselves as legitimately trying to do good, but we also thought about what we could do to make sure that our image reflected that, and there's a lot, a lot of just unimpactful things there that, ultimately, I, I think, in some circles got more attention than actually impactful things. And, you know, I think that on the more tasteful end of the spectrum, you can see, you know, things like a small scale but real charitable initiatives. And on, I think, the less tasteful end of the spectrum, you know, frankly speaking, I mean, I think even things like making sure that all materials have perfect English grammar is a thing where that was important to me.ARS: Sam, let me ask you about this, though, because the other piece of it is using, using your money and influence – and I think there's a question about whose money you were using, but – to donate, for example, to the Democratic Party, in large part, to influence regulation. And I think as people have looked through now, some of the regulation you were pushing for at [the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission], for example, some of that regulation would have allowed you, frankly, to ""self-certify"" a lot of what was going on at FTX, and there are people who look at that and say it was all part of a scheme.SBF: So, unpacking pieces of that, when you look at like this, the CFTC regulation there, ultimately, there may have been an ability to self-certify contracts. But prior to that, we went through a congressional hearing, a public comment period, a public roundtable, a year of inquiries, and tens of thousands of hours, you know, thousands of pages of submitted documents. And still had not gotten to the point of having a license to offer emerging futures in the United States. And so it was an extraordinarily long and hard process that we were going through with the CFTC. And I, you know – it was by far the most intensive regulatory process that I've ever seen.ARS: Can you speak to the lobbying piece of it, though ...SBF: Yeah.ARS: ... and the donations piece of it? Because I think that's become part of the story ...SBF: Yep.ARS: ... as to whether you effectively were influencing lawmakers to do your bidding, and given the state of your current company, questions about whether that should be the case.SBF: So, I mean, lawmakers were not ruling on FTX. FTX didn't have an application before Congress for anything. You know, my donations were mostly for pandemic prevention. And they were looking at primary elections where there were candidates who are outspoken in favor of doing things now to prevent the next pandemic. That was the primary thing that I was supporting with those contributions. And, you know, it was on both sides of, of the aisle primarily operating both primaries because it wasn't – I wasn't viewing it as a partisan exercise. There is not, you know – most of this was not looking at donating to one party to beat the other one in the general elections here. You know, not only was it on both sides, but even within each side, it was between two candidates in the same party and it was looking at pandemic policy.ARS: Where did the money come from for those donations?SBF: So, I, you know, basically profits. I mean, you know, it was substantially smaller than the, you know, amount of trading profits that Alameda had made over the prior few years.ARS: Related to this, you had a meeting with [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair] Gary Gensler. You also met with the folks at [the CFTC]. Do you think you needed to buy your way into those meetings?SBF: I mean, I don't think I needed to buy my way into them. I do think it was harder than I would have thought it would be to get to the point of being even able to have meetings with some regulators. And, I mean, I spent hundreds of hours, probably thousands of hours in [Washington, D.C.] trying to get to the point where I could even have meetings with, with, you know, some of the relevant regulators. But that was not a – that wasn't a money thing. And, I mean, there's no donations to Gary Gensler. He doesn't even have a campaign to donate to in the first place. That was, like, elbow grease. I mean, that was just asking again and again and again to have meetings with relevant regulators and, you know, submitting hundreds and thousands of pages of documents.ARS: You also made big investments in a number of media companies. And I think that's raised a lot of questions about whether you were trying to buy influence. Can you speak to that?SBF: I mean, I think media matters a lot, and I want support good media ventures. That was the whole thesis there. And I, you know, I don't have, like, governance over any of these. I wasn't looking for governance over them. I was looking to support journalists doing great work because I think what they do is really important and I think that there needs to be a critical eye on stories. I'm certainly seeing, you know, being on the, the – getting the brunt of a lot of that right now. And, you know, frankly, I think it's healthy for the world that there is real investigative journalism.ARS: Your parents are law professors. What did you tell them when all of this happened?SBF: I mean, I don't remember exactly when I reached out to them, but, you know, I think I, I called them up and said, ""Hey, guys, I think there might be a problem, like, things – looks like Alameda's position might be imploding here, and there might be liquidity issues. And I'll tell you more when I know more."" That, that is – that's my guess about roughly, roughly what I said, but honestly that, that week so much happened. It's a little bit of a blur to me exactly what was said.ARS: And what are they telling you now?SBF: And look, it's been – it's been a hard period for anyone who was close to me, and none of them deserved that. And I feel really – I mean, look, a lot of, obviously – the largest number of people who are hurt here were customers, and I feel incredibly bad about that. But anyone who is close to me, you know, including my parents, including employees, co-workers who, you know, fought with the company to, to push forward, were hurt by this and bore no responsibility for that. I feel really bad about that. And, I mean, I feel really grateful for the support my parents are still giving me, you know, throughout all of this.ARS: Can you explain the real estate piece of this to us? I think there's been a number of headlines ...SBF: Yeah.ARS: ... as you know, about FTX the company buying a lot of real estate up in the Bahamas ...SBF: Yep.ARS: ... where you lived, at least at the time, was owned by the company. But then there's also reports that your parents signed and were effectively provided with what seemed like a vacation home.SBF: So, I don't know the details of that house for, for my parents, but I knew that it was not intended to be their long-term property. I know it was intended to be the company's property. I don't know how that was papered in and I think that was where it was, was – and will – end up. I think they may have stayed there while working, you know, with the company sometime over the last year. When you look at the rest of it, there were a lot of property purchases in the Bahamas. You know, the reason for that is we had, you know, 100, you know, basically 100 Silicon Valley, you know, top Silicon Valley employees come down here to work for FTX. And, you know, we were trying to incentivize that and to, you know, make sure that they had an easy way to find a comfortable life so that they'd be willing to move and, and help build out the product. And so, you know, those 100 people put together here did end up, you know, buying a substantial amount of property. And I feel kind of – I feel bad about some of how those investments may turn out for them.ARS: Can you just speak to the idea of this company that, at least from the public perspective, seemed like a regulated company or ...SBF: Yep.ARS: ... something that was very focused on compliance. You would go to Washington, you'd talk about compliance, you'd talk about trust.SBF: Yeah.ARS: Crypto, ultimately, is actually about trust.SBF: Yep.ARS: It's about not having to trust others. Frankly, it's supposed to be a trustless system.SBF: Yep.ARS: That's why you trust every – trust it so much supposedly.SBF: Yep.ARS: But it seems like when you read the stories, it sounds like a bunch of kids who are on Adderall having a sleepover party. [Audience laughs.]SBF: I mean, look, I screwed up. Like, I was CEO, I was the CEO of FTX. And, I mean, I say this again and again, that that means I had a responsibility, that means that I was responsible ultimately for us doing the right things and, I mean, we didn't. Like, we, we messed up big.ARS: But there were people, though, that were telling you that you needed more compliance, no?SBF: There were, but I, I think that compliance – we were spending an enormous amount of our energy on compliance. We were spending an enormous amount of our energy on regulation on licensure. We were getting licensed in dozens of jurisdictions. I think, frankly, we were spending probably too much of our energy getting licensed, in retrospect, and, you know, there were some places where I think that the reporting and transparency obligations from that licensure actually did help. I think when you look at, I mean, FTX US Derivatives, I think when you look at FTX Japan, which I think is fully solvent, which I think could make all customers whole tomorrow if it were – if, you know, the sort of relevant teams were to allow it to. I'm confused why it hasn't. But I, but, you know, I think that a lot of what we ended up doing and focusing on was a distraction to some extent from one unbelievably important area that we completely failed on, and that was risk. That was risk management. That was, you know, customer position risk. And, you know, frankly, conflict of interest risk. And, you know, there was no person who was chiefly in charge of positional risk of customers on FTX. And that feels pretty embarrassing in retrospect, because that was – you go back to 2019, even 2018, and ask me, why am I starting to build out FTX? What's the point of it? And what I would have said was, look, the existing crypto derivatives exchanges have large risk management failures that every day there are millions of dollars that are being lost by customers because of risk management failures that these contracts are paying out 75 cents on the dollar week after week after week because of risk management blowouts. And that, that needs to be overhauled. And that was what I was focused on for the beginning of FTX. I was not focused on that for the last year or two. I got less grounded from that and I started focusing on the bigger picture, on, you know, future business avenues on, on licensure, on a lot of things. And, I mean, we lost track of a really important part of the business and of the product. And, so, there absolutely were management failures, huge management failures. I bear responsibility for that. There were oversight failures, transparency failures, reporting, like, so many things we should have had in place. I think that a lot of it was on the risk management side, rather ...ARS: Let me ask you about that. Which is, we had [BlackRock CEO] Larry Fink here today, and he had a stake ...SBF: Yep.ARS: ... in FTX. And Sequoia and Paradigm and some very big venture capital firms had, had, had given you money, and I'm curious if they ever asked you questions about this risk management and whether they bear any responsibility for what clearly now appears that you're saying was at minimum a lack of oversight, if not something much worse.SBF: I don't think that they bear responsible. I mean, like, when you look at – when you put your eyes – you put yourself in the eyes of an investor, of a venture capital firm. What you're thinking about primarily is upside. Right? What you're thinking about primarily is investing in a private company, and thinking might this 3x, might this 5x, might this even 10x on the upside cases, and, yeah, there's some chance that will go down, there's some chance that maybe it will go down to zero. But that's counterbalanced by the upside propositions here. And so most of what they were focused on was, you know, I think, like, what might FTX become, what's the pathway to get from here to there, you know, what would it take? What are the missing pieces? You know, rather than, you know, at the point where you're dwelling on all of the various precise downside scenarios and risks for a prospective venture investment, that means you're not investing. Like, if that's where your head's at, you know, if you think the odds are that that's where things are going to end up, why, why would you do that investment?ARS: Can I ask you about the drugs?SBF: Yeah.ARS: You, you have tweeted about it. Caroline has tweeted about it, others have tweeted about uppers and downers ...SBF: Right.ARS: ... and all sorts of things. There have been pictures taken of something called Emsam ...SBF: Yep.ARS: ... which apparently increases levels of dopamine to the brain to – actually for Parkinson's. Were you taking that? It's a patch.SBF: So, I, it's, it's funny hearing this. I, I had my first sip of alcohol after my 21st birthday, and I think I, I have maybe half a glass of, of alcohol a year, roughly speaking. There were no wild parties here. When we had parties, we played board games and, you know, 20% of people would have three-quarters of a beer each or something like that. And, you know, the rest of us would not drink anything. I didn't see any illegal drug use around me, you know, at the office, at, at these parties. Like, and, and, and, and when I say parties here, I mean, like, you know, having people over for dinner is what that meant. And, look, I can't talk about anyone else, like, you know, what they're prescribed is between themselves and their, their, their doctors or psychiatrists. I can say for me, I don't know, like, I, I have been prescribed various things at various times to help with focus and concentration. I, and, I think they have done that. I haven't felt any of, you know, the sort of impacts that I think people have been theorizing here from it. And it's not a huge impact, you know, in the first place, anyway. I think, you know, these have all just been totally on, on-label use of, of medications. And, you know, I think things that have on the margin helped me focus a little bit. I wish I had been a lot more focused over the last year.ARS: I may have been unfocused in this last moment because I actually wanted to follow up on the question when we're talking about venture capitalists.SBF: Yep.ARS: Sequoia and Paradigm invested in you. But there have now been questions about the fact that you invested in them, and whether these were what some people describe in the business, round-trip deals. Can you speak to that?SBF: I mean, I think well after they had invested in FTX, and I don't know the details, but I think there may have been a small investment into some of their funds. I think, you know, it was something that we did because – and I would believe in what they're doing, it seemed like a, a good opportunity. And didn't think too much about it.ARS: I'm curious just on a very personal level, because we are close to ending this conversation, to the degree that there's been a lesson in this and that what you see as your future at this point. I know you're taking it day to day, obviously.SBF: Yep.ARS: And I know you're an optimist as well. We've talked about that.SBF: Yep.ARS: But what do you think realistically is your future?SBF: So, what is my future? I don't know what my far future is. And, you know, when you fast forward, I have no idea what I'm gonna be doing, you know, a long time from now. I think when I look at, you know, the near- and medium-term, what am I thinking? What I'm thinking is – and, again, I don't know what's going to happen. And a lot of it's not my hands at this point. But I want to be helpful wherever I can to regulators, administrators, you know, internationally, who are working to, you know, to help FTX's customers, and I want to be helpful wherever I can on anything that could help bring a lot more value to those customers. And, you know, I don't know where that will lead. I can say that prior to filing, there had been a lot of interest in, in financing. A lot of fairly strong interest, you know, many billions of dollars' worth. I don't – I can't make any promises about anything, but I, I would have thought that there would be a chance for a pathway forward here that would bring more value to customers than what would happen if you just sort of sold everything off for, you know, scraps, and I don't have confidence. I, I can't promise you – I can't promise anyone anything there, and it's not really in my hands to a large extent. But, but I would think that it would make sense to be exploring that, because I, I think there's a chance that customers could end up made a lot more whole, I don't know, maybe even fully whole, if there was a really strong, concerted effort.ARS: How would that happen?SBF: So, you know, there have been examples of this before in crypto history where that happened. Obviously, you can look at what happened with Bitfinex back a number of years ago where it got hacked and then ended up making, over a few-year period, customers whole. There are a lot of assets that are on hand here, although many of them are not liquid. They were worth quite a bit more than the, you know, liabilities a month ago, even, a lot of them a year ago. You know, there's – at least a month ago, there were, you know, or, I guess, you know, three weeks ago, billions of dollars of potential funding opportunities. You know, I don't know that it would have been great for my stake as a shareholder of FTX. But that's not what matters here. And I think it would have brought more financing to customers. You saw, obviously, you know, the TRON facility which was open for a little while on FTX, which allowed some customers to get liquidity. And, you know, you put some of these together. You know, there's obviously, you know, equity in the business. Where's that lead? I don't know exactly. And, again, it's not going to be my decision to make at the end of the day, but I, but I think there's a shot for a real value.ARS: Sam, we're gonna have to wrap up, and a couple of just quick other questions.SBF: Yep.ARS: One is, given what you know about compliance, or the lack of it in this businessSBF: Yep.ARS: ... in this industry ...SBF: Yep.ARS: ... I think there are a lot of people who are holding crypto today, perhaps on exchanges like Binance and other places.SBF: Yep.ARS: What should they think, given what you do know and to the extent that you can tell us the truth about what you know?SBF: What should they think? And, and, I, I presume you're asking, what should they think about the safety of their assets going forward?ARS: Correct.SBF: Yeah. So, look, I don't – I obviously don't know exactly what's going on at other exchanges. I can tell you what I would think as a customer, you know, if I were a customer here, which is: Look for the things that I wish FTX had been able to supply, things like proof of reserves is helpful. Look for as rigorous of that as you can. Look for regulatory reporting, right. You look at what the [Financial Services Agency] had in place in Japan. You look at what FTX US Derivatives had with, you know, sort of frequent reporting to regulators of exactly what, you know, customer assets, balances, liabilities, distributions are. And ...ARS: What about the governance piece?SBF: Yeah.ARS: What about the governance piece, because one of the things we have not talked about, is you had no board and you had no CFO. And that should have been a red flag, frankly, for all of us.SBF: So, interestingly, in some ways, we had too many boards, we had ...[Sam Bankman-Fried's video cuts out, but is then restored within a minute.]ARS: Sam, thank you for coming back. We were in the middle of the conversation about no board, no CFO, and you said something which I think raised a lot of eyebrows here. You said you thought you had too many boards.SBF: Yeah. And can you hear me here?ARS: Yep, we can all hear you.SBF: Cool. So, we didn't talk about it much but there's a board of FTX Japan, there's a board of FTX US Derivatives, FTX Australia, FTX Singapore, FTX Europe. You know, we had, I think, more than a dozen boards, when you look at all of the entities put together. And, you know, many of these boards had regulatory functions. I think the problem to some extent was, OK, sure, you have all these boards. But at the end of the day, when push comes to shove, who's the person who's in charge of global – or the board or, or, or the function that's in charge of, you know, global site, customer risk management. Like, you know, there's a diffusion of responsibility to some extent on that front. And, you know, there needed to be, I think, a single or a small set of entities, whether – of boards, people, of responsible parties that were sitting there saying, ""I feel responsible for what happens on FTX."" And, you know, we had, we had actually audited financials. From the FTX finances perspective, we had infrastructure, but from the customer risk and finances perspective, much less.ARS: Sam, how much money do you have left at this point?SBF: I mean, to my knowledge, like, close to nothing.ARS: What does that mean?SBF: I mean, everything was just in the companies. I mean, it's ...ARS: You didn't put away some money?SBF: No, no, I, I don't have any, you know, hidden funds here. Everything I have, I'm disclosing and, you know, I'm, I'm down to – I think I have one working credit card left. I think it, I think it might be $100,000 or something like that in, in that bank account. And, I mean, I, you know, everything that I had, even all the loans I had were, those, you know, those were all things that I was reinvesting in, in the businesses that – I had put everything I had into FTX.ARS: I want to ask you two final questions. Were you truthful with us today?SBF: I, I was as truthful as, as I, as, you know, I'm knowledgeable to be. There's, there's some things I wish I knew about more. But, yes, I was.ARS: So let me ask you this. Do you agree that over time you also lied?SBF: Do I believe – do I agree that I lied? I don't know of times when I lied. I think, look, there are certainly times when I was acting as a, as a representative, as a marketer for FTX and when I was looking for how can I, you know, in a way which is truthful, but, you know, paint FTX as, you know, compelling a way as possible, as exciting and optimistic a way as possible. And, you know, I wasn't thinking about – I wasn't talking about what are the risks involved with FTX, you know, there. I obviously wished that I had spent more time dwelling on the downsides and less time thinking about the upsides.ARS: Sam Bankman-Fried, I want to thank you for this interview. I hope that some of the answers have been helpful as we've tried to understand and untangle what is a still-tangled story. Sam, I know that this has been a difficult conversation and a tough conversation. And on behalf of everybody here and on behalf of the public, I want to thank you for engaging in it at a time, in truth, when I know you've been advised not to, so thank you so very, very much. Thank you.[Audience applauds.]",2022/12/01
259,"Crypto exchange Kraken is laying off 30% of its global staff – around 1,100 people – in response to the crypto market downturn, the company said Wednesday.This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Crypto prices rise: Bitcoin (BTC) cracked the $17,000 threshold for the first time since the early part of November. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $17,060, up 3.6% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto in market value, was recently changing hands just below $1,300, a 6.6% gain from Tuesday, same time. Other cryptos were largely moving upward, with UNI, the token of the smart contracts-based Uniswap platform, up more than 6% and popular meme coin DOGE rising more than 3%.But November is dismal: Bitcoin fell in value by more than 18% for the month and ether tumbled 21% amid the collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX and the ensuing fallout. FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection little more than a week after CoinDesk reported irregularities on the balance sheet of its trading arm Alameda Capital, and other companies with exposure to FTX have been forced into survival mode. Still, a few tokens soared above the mess, including BAND and LTC, which jumped 57% and 38%, respectively.Equity markets enjoyed a memorable day as investors, buoyed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish remarks at the Brookings Institution’s Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy on Wednesday, sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq up 4.4%, and the S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, and Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 3% and 2.1%, respectively. Brent crude oil, a measure of energy markets, sank 0.2%.",2022/11/30
260,"The correlation of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) to the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has once again turned negative. BTC’s correlation coefficient to the DXY has fallen to -0.36, after moving as high as 0.84 on Nov. 19.Correlation coefficients measure the relationship between two assets, and range between 1 and -1. The former implies a direct pricing relationship between the assets, while the latter indicates an inverse relationship.BTC had held a persistently inverse relationship to the DXY since July, before crossing into positive territory on Nov 9. In August, the correlation between the two assets fell to -0.94.The timing of the reversal coincides with FTX-related market turmoil because the shift in pricing relationship occurred on the same day that Binance and FTX’s tentative deal fell through. The return to negative correlations signals that:On the first point, bitcoin has resumed its bout of range-bound trading, albeit near $16,500 as opposed to $19,500. The 15% haircut represents the discount applied to asset prices following questions about FTX and related contagion. Volatility, as measured by the Average True Range (ATR), has declined 40% over the most recent two weeks, as markets have begun to calm.ETH’s correlation to the DXY has also returned to negative, while its volatility has declined 35%. BTC and ETH remain highly correlated, with a coefficient of 0.90.On the second point, a steadying of BTC's price and return to inverse correlations means that issues pertinent to U.S. dollar movement will have significance for BTC as well. Investors should weigh Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments Wednesday and the central bank’s next meeting on Dec. 14 when it decides on the fed funds rate.Amid the lack of price volatility, institutional-sized asset managers have continued to reduce their long exposure to BTC. According to the most recent Commitment of Traders (COT) report, asset managers trimmed their long exposure by 247 contracts, the third time this has occurred in as many weeks.On Nov. 8, asset managers comprised 43.4% of long open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. As of the most recent release, that number has declined to 29.7%. Leveraged funds now make up the largest percentage of open interest at 31.3% long, while comprising 47.2% of short open interest.The 378 contract increase in long positions is down from the 1,367-contract increase in the prior report. The shift could be related to the February contract for BTC now moving into contango as opposed to backwardation. Contango occurs when futures prices for later months exceed those of nearer months. This condition is often bullish for spot prices, and prices tend to move toward the higher futures contract prices as expiration approaches.",2022/11/30
261,"The turbulence in the overall cryptocurrency sector following FTX’s collapse this month is well known. What’s gotten less attention, however, is the failure of projects that attempted to use the underlying crypto ledger technology in private, corporate settings, the once-hyped ecosystem known collectively as enterprise blockchain.This week, TradeLens, a blockchain system built by software firm IBM and closely linked to shipping giant Maersk, announced it was shutting down, citing a lack of commercial traction. Some two weeks ago, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) said it was scrapping a much-delayed blockchain announced in 2016 that was meant to replace the clearing and settlement system that powers that equities market.Neither IBM nor ASX responded to requests for comment by press time.Back in the early days of 2015 to 2016, a groundswell of banks and large companies saw potential in taking blockchain technology – which, as originally designed for bitcoin and the rest of crypto, is a public platform open to basically anyone – into private, firewalled realms where groups of companies could use the tech to track assets and distribute an immutable record of their existence.The enterprise blockchain space, which doesn’t seem to experience the same bullish and bearish market cycles as public crypto, is now feeling a change in the broader economic climate, particularly in areas like shipping. This is one of the reasons TradeLens is closing shop, according to Lars Jensen, CEO of Vespucci Maritime, a consultancy firm to the container shipping industry.“The container shipping industry has had a run of two years of extreme profits, which allowed access to pursue all manner of technological solutions out there,” Jensen said in an interview. “Now, the tide has turned and industry is going to be under severe pressure. So that means for all the technological solutions out there, this is crunch time. Do you provide commercial value above and beyond what is just hopes and dreams for the future?”Speaking of TradeLens specifically, Jensen pointed out there is a lot of competition from a range of different track-and-trace solutions in the container shipping space.“TradeLens basically wanted to provide everything to everybody,” Jensen said. “But some of the other visibility providers out there are a lot more niche. They focus on either specific stakeholders or specific parts of the process, and they have a lot more commercial success. So this might also be an indication that the market might not have an appetite for a one-stop-shop solution that covers everything, but is more amenable to more specific and targeted solutions for specific problems.”Richard G. Brown, chief technology officer of R3, the builder of the Corda enterprise blockchain and one of the first startups in the space, said that while the shuttering of TradeLens and the ASX blockchain has happened in quick succession, the reasons are very different.The ASX project’s failures have more to do with engagement between stakeholders and technology choices, said Brown, who referred to an Accenture report on the system.“When it comes to TradeLens, it’s not about a failure in the technology,” Brown said in an interview. “The demise of TradeLens may have something to do with IBM pulling back, or partly the cyclicality in the shipping industry, but the technology and the concept seem to be architecturally congruent from the outside.”Stepping back, Paul Brody, head of blockchain at global consultancy firm Ernst & Young, believes the whole idea of private blockchains is fundamentally flawed. Brody and his team have been long-time adherents of promoting enterprise adoption of the public Ethereum blockchain, which has included using tech such as zero-knowledge proofs to make the tech palatable to big businesses.“All these private blockchain ventures have the same basic problem,” Brody told CoinDesk. “It’s a Web2 business model, but a little bit of Web3 pixie dust sprinkled on. And once the pixie dust kind of wears off, the value proposition doesn’t look so hot.”",2022/11/30
262,"The rapid collapse of billionaire-turned-scourge Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire will likely be remembered for posterity as one of the blockchain industry's worst-ever episodes, and nowhere was that more evident than in the performance of digital-asset markets.Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, plunged by 18% in November, its biggest monthly loss in five months. Ether (ETH), the Ethereum blockchain’s native cryptocurrency and the second-largest overall, tumbled 21%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) lost 16%.Hardest hit in digital-asset markets was a group of tokens commonly associated with Bankman-Fried – because he either invested in them or was one of the biggest backers of the projects, or both. Colloquially, they have become known in crypto-market circles as the “Sam coins.”FTT, the utility token of the FTX exchange, tumbled 90%, falling from $26 to about $1.The plunge began shortly after CoinDesk first reported on Nov. 2 that Alameda Research, a trading firm owned by Bankman-Fried, had a balance sheet chock full of the FTX exchange’s own tokens – perhaps the first clear indication of improper self-dealing and excessive risk-taking by the entrepreneur. According to the report, Alameda held $3.66 billion of “unlocked FTT” and a $2.16 billion pile of “FTT collateral” as the third-largest entry on the assets side of its accounting ledger.Serum (SRM), the native token of a decentralized exchange on the Bankman-Fried-championed Solana blockchain, fell 70% in November – the biggest loser for the month among the roughly 160 digital assets in the CoinDesk Market Index.Solana’s native token, SOL, dropped 58% for the month as the Alameda balance sheet also revealed holdings of $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.” The fear among traders was that Alameda (and other market players) might suddenly move to dump the tokens, further exacerbating the selling pressure.The market fallout inflicted widespread casualties on the industry. Sino Global Capital, one of Asia’s biggest and most well-known crypto investors and led by longtime crypto investor Matthew Graham, was closely allied with FTX and had invested in many of the “Sam coins.” According to the firm, its “direct exposure to FTX exchange was confined to mid-seven figures held in custody.” The firm has declined to quantify any losses related to indirect exposure, such as from holding the tokens that tumbled in value.A key tone shift in crypto markets during the month was just how dramatically they diverged from the path of traditional markets. Stocks shined as investors processed speculation that the Federal Reserve might slow the pace of interest rate hikes as soon as December. The S&P 500 is up 2.2% in November, while gold climbed 7.8%.BAND, the native token of cross-chain data oracle platform Band Protocol, was the big leader in the CoinDesk Market Index, surging 57% during the month. The jump came as its mainnet successfully upgraded to its BandChain, increasing throughput by 10 times.Litecoin’s LTC token rallied 38%. The Litecoin blockchain is approaching its third mining-reward halving – a programmed code that will cut LTC's pace of supply expansion by 50%. These blockchain-supply halvings have historically bolstered cryptocurrency prices, analysts say.Decentralized exchange dYdX's native token ended in the green, up 0.7%.For most crypto traders, though, the November pain will likely be felt far more acutely than any spotty gains.",2022/11/30
263,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — In its eighth and final meeting of 2022, the Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates by another 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage point, Fed Chair Jerome Powell implied Wednesday. The previous four Fed rate hikes were for 75 basis points, or 0.75 percentage point.“It makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down,” Powell said at an event at the Brookings Institute in Washington, D.C. “Time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting.” A 50-basis point hike would lift short-term rates to a target range to 4.25 to 4.50%.Bitcoin (BTC) jumped about 1% on the news to $16,982.Speculation over a smaller rate hike mounted in recent weeks after two consecutive lower-than-expected inflation reports by the U.S. Labor Department gave central bankers some relief that price pressure is starting to cool.The Fed chair also said that the terminal rate would be higher than previously forecast in the latest economic projections by the FOMC in September, which projected rates going as high as 5%.“The ultimate level of rates will need to be somewhat higher than thought at the time of the September meeting in the summary of economic projections,"" Powell said.Powell’s comments come after a report from payroll processing firm ADP on Wednesday showed that private hiring slowed to its lowest level since January 2021 after companies added just 127,000 jobs in November, a steep drop from the 239,000 reported in October.On Friday, the Labor Department will publish a fresh nonfarm payrolls report which, in addition to the consumer price index (CPI) next month, will be the last major economic data the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sees before its meeting on Dec. 13-14.UPDATE (Nov. 30, 19:09): Added Powell's comments about the terminal rate.",2022/11/30
264,"Officials in the European Union (EU) say their landmark new legislation, the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), would have prevented FTX-style collapses – but there’s also a major loophole that could allow offshore companies to continue to operate within the bloc.Even when the Markets in Crypto Assets legislation goes into force in the coming years, companies like FTX, based in the Bahamas, would still be able to serve EU clients without extra regulation, thanks to a technique known as reverse solicitation.MiCA requires companies targeting the EU market to register with a local regulator, with checks on their governance and marketing – ensuring that, for example, they don’t mislead potential investors, or misuse client funds, as FTX was alleged to have done before it filed for bankruptcy earlier in November.But the text – politically approved but not yet formally enacted – contains some pretty wide exemptions that could in reality allow EU citizens to go to a foreign crypto site and buy all the bitcoin they want.Reverse solicitation exists because, on a practical level, it’s hard for regulators to enforce financial rules on overseas firms, and because they don’t want to block companies from seeking foreign expertise outright. But it can also be abused, such as via standard contract clauses which deem a trade to have taken place at the client’s sole request.MiCA broadly allows the practice, but, compared to other EU financial service laws, includes stronger powers for supervisors to stop solicitation being abused - including an ad ban for unauthorized products. However, the detailed ground rules need to be set by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which has to issue guidelines, and its officials already see this topic as a source of concern.Reverse solicitation “might be a particularly pronounced problem in this space of crypto assets, and that is something that is of concern for us,” Steffen Kern, head of ESMA’s Risk Analysis and Economics Department, told lawmakers Wednesday.“Service providers outside the EU play a dominant role in crypto markets and should be expected to do so” even after MiCA is implemented, Kern added.One answer, favored by the European Commission, which proposed MiCA and is now responsible for monitoring the new law, is to ensure other jurisdictions play ball using the same rulebook.“Crypto asset markets are global, interconnected and mobile,” Alexandra Jour-Schroeder, a deputy director-general at the commission’s financial-services arm, told lawmakers on Wednesday, She said unilateral clampdowns in places like China have done little to curb citizens’ access to crypto.“We have to be vigilant that our EU protections are not undermined by jurisdictions that ultimately fail to regulate and supervise their companies,” she said. She added that she wants other countries to adopt crypto rules on the EU model.In traditional finance, received wisdom is that the problem will largely solve itself. Alhough you might find the odd client from overseas, to really scale up in the EU market you’ll need a proper marketing campaign, which means you need to be based there; a regulatory badge of approval will prove a selling point, the argument goes.“In financial services there's a flight to quality over time” due precisely to FTX-style scandals, Barney Reynolds, a partner in the financial services practice of London law firm Shearman, told CoinDesk. “Business gravitates to where the most sophisticated regulators and regulations are.""The question is whether that logic applies in a sector where people are as likely to get advice from Reddit or YouTube as from a regulated financier, and where decentralized freedom from government control is part of the attraction. Jour-Schroder might be able to persuade the U.S. and U.K. to regulate crypto, but what about Bahamas, Dubai and Antigua, or those firms that deny they have any headquarters at all?It’s that kind of question that leaves some lawmakers nonplussed, and concerned that EU registration confers an unfair disadvantage.“Companies physically present in the EU targeting EU consumers have to adhere to all these principles, rules and regulations,” Dutch lawmaker Michiel Hoogeveen told CoinDesk after the Wednesday hearing. “There's a disbalance, and a loophole.”“I don't really think they [the commission] have a concrete answer, and it's something that we have to look into in the future – to find out how to prevent these loopholes from happening,” Hoogeveen said.Read more: EU’s MiCA Crypto Law Would Have Stopped FTX Malpractice, Officials Say ",2022/11/30

266,"Casa, a popular Bitcoin self-custody firm, is adding Ethereum support to its platform in what some may consider an unlikely move. An overhauled version of the Casa app will launch in January, according to the firm.Although the company's original CEO and co-founder, Jeremy Welch, had floated the idea of onboarding multiple cryptocurrencies early in the firm's history, some people consider Casa to be a purely Bitcoin company. This may have to do with the popularity of the firm’s chief technology officer and co-founder, Jameson Lopp, an outspoken cypherpunk and Bitcoin advocate with nearly half a million Twitter followers.Read more: What Is Crypto Custody?Regardless of the public perception, come January Casa will not only support Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), but will also be easier to use, thanks to user experience improvements that will be part of the platform overhaul, according to a release provided to CoinDesk.“Casa will soon debut a refreshed app, with an enhanced look and feel that will improve members’ experience. Following that, Casa will introduce Ethereum storage, as well as new membership plans,” the release said.The app works by leveraging crypto’s multisignature, or “multisig,” functionality. Multisig is when a user needs more than one signature to spend crypto funds. A user holding bitcoin (BTC) in a Casa wallet for example, could use a “2-of-3” multisig, meaning, three private keys exist, but only two are required to spend funds. If the user loses one key, they can still access their funds with the remaining two (one of which is entrusted to and securely stored by Casa).“You have multiple keys protecting one pool of bitcoin or ether. That means if you lose one key, you don't lose all of your money,” current Casa CEO, Nick Neuman, told CoinDesk in an interview. “So you actually have some resilience and redundancy that provides significantly more security, and you don't have these stories of people losing their life savings.”Indeed, cryptocurrency exchange FTX’s swift collapse earlier this month saw many retail investors, including former FTX employees, lose their financial nest eggs. The implosion reinvigorated the “not your keys, not your coins” mantra (meaning, control of crypto assets requires control of the assets’ private keys) and appears to have brought self-custody solutions to the forefront.“The recent failure of FTX – and ensuing catastrophic loss of customer funds – highlights the critical importance of people having a simple and secure way to hold their own private keys,” said Lopp. “Self-custody is the only way to prove ownership and control of your digital assets.”Read more: FTX Employees Were Encouraged to Keep Life Savings in the Now-Bankrupt Exchange, Sources SayWhat of Lopp’s strong ties to the Bitcoin community and the image of Casa (at least to some) as a “Bitcoin only” platform? Will onboarding Ethereum tarnish that image and trigger an exodus of so-called “Bitcoin maximalists” from Casa’s customer base? Neuman doesn't think so.“Ethereum has been our most frequent customer request for the last couple of years, and so am I concerned that it will damage our brand or business? No, because we've been listening to our customers,” Neuman said. “The vision for Casa is really about being the private key manager for everything important in your life. So that's not just your bitcoin. It’s all of your types of money.”",2022/11/30

While bulls seem heartened by bitcoin's ability to hold the $16,000-$20,000 range amid the crypto collapse, Bindseil and Schaff called the current price action ""an artificially induced last gasp before the road to irrelevance.""The ""conceptual design and technological shortcomings,"" of bitcoin make it unsuitable for payments, and since the crypto does not generate cash flows or dividends, it's a poor investment as well, they argued.Trotting out the well-worn Ponzi argument, the two claimed bitcoin's value is reliant on continuing waves of fresh money from new investors, and said ""big bitcoin investors have the strongest incentives to keep the euphoria going.""Don't misunderstand regulation as approval, the two warned, criticizing the fast-growing crypto lobbying class as putting forth the idea that crypto is just another asset class worthy of a spot in investor portfolios.The ECB is not known for championing crypto but the bank's critical assessment of bitcoin came with a warning about how the industry is regulated.

269,"Last week, the leading crypto wallet provider MetaMask came under fire for a change to its terms of service that revealed it was sharing user IP information with Infura, a piece of blockchain infrastructure created by MetaMask creator ConsenSys.ConsenSys, a research and development company led by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, built MetaMask to offer users a convenient way to store and trade their crypto without needing to trust centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance – platforms that store, or “custody,” funds on a user’s behalf.This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.Relative to “cold” wallets that allow users to custody their crypto keys on a kind of USB thumb drive, MetaMask, a “hot wallet,” is installed on your phone or web browser and is continuously connected to the internet. While convenient – you only need to keep track of a username and password, not a physical thumb drive – “hot wallets” are theoretically more vulnerable to attacks and information leaks because they are always connected to the Web.But compared to centralized exchanges, hot wallets like MetaMask are, at least in theory, more private and secure than allowing someone else to manage your assets.The revelation that MetaMask was sharing IP information with Infura set off a firestorm on Twitter, with many users upset to learn their identifying information could have leaked to Infura – meaning their transaction history was not as private as they once thought.The FTX debacle, along with last week’s MetaMask controversy, resurfaced a familiar refrain in the world of crypto: “not your keys, not your crypto.”If you hold your funds on a centralized platform, they risk being stolen or misappropriated (as happened in the case of FTX, which apparently loaned out user funds without users knowing).Downloading a hot wallet was supposed to be a safer way to get around the “not your keys” problem – your MetaMask funds are only accessible to you. But when users realized that MetaMask, too, was vulnerable to centralizing parties, they scrambled to figure out how they might be able to use the wallet without connecting it to Infura – a so-called RPC service that MetaMask uses to communicate with the Ethereum blockchain.While ConsenSys noted in a statement that it is technically possible to use MetaMask sans Infura, users quickly realized that doing so would be confusing and impractical – requiring one to jerry-rig a new solution for reading information from the Ethereum blockchain.The MetaMask controversy – and the anti-centralization discourse that surrounded it – serves as a harsh reminder of a hard truth that the crypto industry must face as it rebuilds from the FTX rubble: Centralized intermediaries have seeped deep into the crypto user experience.In the crypto world – particularly within the Ethereum ecosystem – “centralization,” the idea of influence and oversight from central parties, is viewed as anathema to the core, post-2008 concepts upon which the technology was born.But time and time again – at every single level of the crypto user experience – centralization continues to rear its head.When Mt. Gox, the first large crypto exchange, lost user funds to a hack in 2014, it was – at the time – processing around 70% of all Bitcoin transactions. The Mt. Gox calamity was supposed to be a wake-up call to the dangers of centralized parties in crypto, a time to return to self-custody and first principles.But almost a decade later, FTX collapsed in an even more cynical fashion – with the exchange’s own creators misappropriating user funds.Though there has been early evidence of users moving to decentralized platforms in response to FTX, centralized platforms such as Binance, Coinbase and Kraken remain the dominant methods by which people store and trade crypto.It’s hard to tell someone to go out and buy a cold wallet and use Uniswap to exchange their crypto when there’s an abundance of nicely packaged, easy-to-use centralized platforms waiting around.Even if more of today’s centralized incumbents fall apart, it’s difficult to imagine that traditional financial institutions won’t eventually fill the void they leave behind with their own heavily regulated crypto entry points.And it’s not just the technology by which retail users access crypto that has lent (and will continue to lend) power to centralized intermediaries; even the core technology upon which blockchains operate has not been immune to centralization.The validators that operate Ethereum’s blockchain do so by “staking” some sum of cryptocurrency with the blockchain in order to help write and authenticate transactions. But staking is a technically complicated endeavor, and misconfiguring a staking node can incur costly penalties.As a result, more and more users are opting to stake (and earn rewards for doing so) via centralized platforms like Coinbase and Binance. Even community-driven “decentralized” staking services, like Lido, have caught the ire of decentralization maximalists due to their massive influence over the Ethereum ecosystem.And then there’s the block-building process, the technically complicated means by which validators compile user transactions and write them to the blockchain. In order to extract MEV – extra profit that can be earned by ordering transactions in a clever way – validators are increasingly turning to third parties like Flashbots to build blocks for them.Heavy use of the Flashbots block builders, while convenient and lucrative, has led to fears that certain kinds of transactions – like those associated with U.S. Treasury Department-sanctioned Ethereum addresses – might have a harder time making it onto the blockchain because Flashbots excludes the transactions from blocks to avoid angering regulators.While tech-savvy, ideological-driven crypto users might find ways to run and transact on blockchains in accordance with the movement’s founding principles, retail investors and financial institutions – those that need to adopt crypto technology in order for it to achieve internet-scale ubiquity – will continue to gravitate toward easy-to-use middlemen that abandon decentralization in favor of convenience and capitalism.While it is reasonable to strive for a fully decentralized financial ecosystem, it is difficult to imagine that the financial instruments of the future – or, at the very least, the means by which most people access them – won’t look more like Coinbase than Uniswap.",2022/11/30
270,"Investor interest in digital assets has changed in the past year as crypto prices declined, Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a research report Wednesday. Retail interest in prices levels and volatility has eased while demand for regulated products for traditional financial clients has increased, the bank said.Following this month’s demise of crypto exchange FTX and its sister company Alameda Research, the “market is reassessing the value of all the project tokens issued” and “whether they have been used as assets for leverage,” the note said.Discussions at the bank’s second annual Cryptocurrency vs. Traditional Finance event on Monday showed more bankruptcies and deleveraging are expected.While it is unclear how long that process may take, most participants were of the view that “crypto, blockchain and distributed-ledger technology are going to be developed further in the future and increasingly used to trade financial assets.”The focus is still on building digital-asset infrastructure, though some investors are of the view that it could be a 10 to 15 year journey before digital assets become fully mainstream.The bank notes that it is now a year since what’s become known as the crypto winter started.Recent price action and characteristics suggest that the current cycle is similar to that seen in 2017-18. Both times, bitcoin’s (BTC) price fell by more than 70% from its peak and experienced a similar drop around this point in the process following a period of low volatility.Crypto market leverage, however, is greater in this cycle than it was in the last. That’s probably because crypto institutions such as market makers, companies and investors are the dominant traders in the market this time round, whereas in 2017-18, retail investors dominated.Morgan Stanley expects deleveraging to continue, noting that stablecoin market capitalization, particularly for the largest stablecoin tether (USDT), has been falling in the last month. It noted that Alameda Research was the largest single recipient of tether.Read more: JPMorgan: Push to Regulate Crypto to Accelerate After FTX’s Collapse ",2022/11/30
271,"“FTX is not the first cryptocurrency platform to collapse, nor will it be the last,” said Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong while answering lawmakers' questions about the crypto giant’s rapid failure in early November.The country's Parliament put financial regulators and the Ministry of Finance in the hot seat on Wednesday with a series of questions about crypto regulation and the potential impact of FTX’s demise on the broader economy.Since the collapse, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which was one of the first in the world to set up a rigorous regulatory regime for crypto companies, has had to answer tough questions about its treatment of crypto entities – particularly why the regulator had placed FTX’s rival Binance on an investor alert list (IAL) but had allowed state fund Temasek to invest in the former.Wong, who is also deputy chairman of the country’s central bank, reiterated that the IAL targets crypto companies that solicit Singapore customers without a requisite license.“This does not mean that all entities which are not listed on the IAL are safe to deal with. MAS cannot possibly provide an exhaustive list of all the unsafe or unlicensed entities that exist in the world,” Wong said, answering questions on behalf of the MAS.Singapore made up 6% of FTX’s global customer distribution, according to a chart shown during FTX’s bankruptcy hearing. Wong said on Wednesday that the MAS does not have data on the “number of retail users of FTX.”Read more: There Was No Cause to Add FTX to Investor Alert List Before Collapse, Singapore's MAS SaysWong also addressed the investment of Singapore’s state-owned investment fund Temasek into FTX, saying that it had caused not just financial loss but also reputational damage. Days after Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto enterprise filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S., Temasek announced it had written off its entire FTX investment of $275 million, which it said was made after conducting eight months of due diligence. Wong said that Temasek had initiated an internal review by an independent team to study and improve its processes, and to draw lessons for the future.He pushed back on calls for more guidelines and safeguards over Temasek investments, saying that there was “no need for additional audit requirements or Parliamentary Committees,” and that the boards should be insulated from political pressure.Wong also defended the standards already in place.“The occurrence of investment losses does not in itself imply that the governance system is not working. Rather, this is the nature of investment and risk-taking,” Wong said.He added that Singapore’s investment entities must take lessons from success and failure and “continue to take well-judged risks in order to achieve good overall returns in the long term.”Wong assured that spillovers from the FTX collapse will be “very limited” for Singapore’s broader financial system and economy. MAS’ surveillance shows that key financial institutions in Singapore have insignificant exposures to cryptocurrency and crypto players.“The collapse of FTX and other major cryptocurrency platforms should bring about much-needed rationalization in the cryptocurrency space. The repercussions on the cryptocurrency ecosystem globally are still unfolding, and we are watching this,” Wong said.The MAS plans to introduce basic investor protection measures, he added. The proposals laid out in a consultation paper published Oct 26, include having service providers administer risk awareness tests, segregate customers’ assets from their own assets and refrain from operating a trading platform while taking proprietary positions for their own accounts.Read more: Singapore Banks' Exposure to Bitcoin 'Insignificant' but Subject to Highest Risk Weight",2022/11/30

""They're nervous about where the contagion goes, what counterparties they're working with. Can they put money in different places? Are they going to lose it? So people are cautious.""Ether fared even better, recently climbing more than 7.5% to $1,272, its highest level since the second week of November. Other major cryptos assumed various hues of green, with UNI, the token of the smart contracts-based Uniswap platform, and SUSHI, the token of the decentralized exchange SushiSwap, each recently rising over 7%. The popular meme coin DOGE continued its momentum, rising 6% to trade at over 10 U.S. cents. DOGE has jumped roughly 50% over the past week.U.S. equity indexes closed mixed amid rising macroeconomic uncertainties, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 down 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading flat. On Tuesday the Chinese government ratcheted up its efforts to quell the COVID-related demonstrations, sending police to protest hubs and increasing online censorship.And markets will be listening nervously on Wednesday to remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, part of the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. Fed officials have recently suggested an openness to more dovish interest rate hikes, even while reiterating their commitment to lowering inflation through monetary tightening.Markets will also be eyeing U.S. congressional efforts to head off a railroad strike that could send prices of goods upward, reversing recent progress. The Consumer Price Index dipped to 7.7% in October, lower than the consensus projection and down from 8.2% the previous month.Floating Point Group's Peurifoy was circumspect about predicting how low bitcoin's price would reach in the current bearish environment. ""How many more pieces will fall?"" he asked. ""How many people will have to sell crypto to get liquidity? People are holding back selling if they don't need to, but at the same time some people are having to because of economic situations.""""We're at this pause period. I call it the doldrums,"" he also said.Grayscale's digital asset trusts, such as GBTC and ETHE, are trading at a serious discountBy Sam ReynoldsGrayscale is best known for its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), but it also operates a whole suite of digital asset-based trusts.Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also CoinDesk's parent company.When discussing GBTC, the words ""discount"" and ""record"" often come in the same sentence.GBTC trades at a significant discount because there’s no redemption function for the trust. Meanwhile, bitcoin exchange-traded funds listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange is where the liquidity is going. The ""Hotel California"" nature of GBTC was supposed to be solved by converting the trust into a bitcoin ETF, but the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has continued to block it. This has led Grayscale to file a lawsuit.So far this year, the GBTC discount has blown past its previous records given the broader FTX market contagion, and is now trading at a negative 40%.And GBTC is just one of the trusts offered by Grayscale.Many other digital asset trusts that have significant assets under management (AUM) face the same predicament as GBTC.Data compiled from YCharts shows that Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust is trading at a 43.7% discount, while its ZCash Trust trades at just under a 49% discount.Its Ethereum Classic Trust, meanwhile, trades at a whopping 70% discount.Of course, all these have the same problem: The shares can be traded on the open market after a long lockup period, but not redeemed for the underlying asset. Grayscale is one of the largest holders of GBTC, simply because DCG has allocated so much cash for buybacks.“The Trust currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval to operate an ongoing redemption program,” reads a 10Q filing for the ZCash Trust. Similar language is found in a 10Q filing for the Ethereum Trust.One other problem is these other trusts simply don’t have the institutional interest that GBTC has. According to data compiled by 13F.info, which tracks 13F filings by fund managers, GBTC is held by 61 fund managers, while ETHE is held by 37.Cathie Wood’s ARK has still been buying GBTC, but its holdings of GBTC were down by 26% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter in 2021, according to 13F data ARK's much smaller holdings of ETHE are down by 15% during the same time period. There certainly are others making buys, but the scale just isn’t there.Grayscale’s other trusts are too small to be listed in 13F filings. The Litecoin Trust has a significant premium, but there hasn’t yet been institutional interest in the product.It’s tough to see how this can all turn around, considering the bear market and the SEC’s reluctance to offer a redemption scheme.8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(00:30 UTC) Australia's Monthly Consumer Price Index (YoY/Oct) 9:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:00 UTC) China's NBS Manufacturing PMI (Nov) 9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) United States' Gross Domestic Product Annualized (Q3) In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:BlockFi to Make First Appearance in Bankruptcy Court; Bitcoin Bounces Above $16KCryptocurrency lender BlockFi, the latest casualty of the FTX collapse, was scheduled to make its first appearance in bankruptcy court after filing for Chapter 11 protection.

However, trademarking the term, which deters others from using it, could be seen as opposite of an idea of a true decentralized internet.In the previous announcement, TBD said that ""it's not our intention to prevent others from using Web5, but we want to establish an initial way to defend its principles,"" and added that it was working on ways to enable commercial and noncommercial uses of Web5, ""as long as participants respect the meaning of the term and uphold its main attributes.""However, after the community backlash the company decided to suspend the plan until further notice.

277,"Beto O’Rourke returned a $1 million donation from political megadonor and former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried four days before the November election, according to the Texas Tribune.The former Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate reportedly decided to reimburse the donation, which he received on Oct. 11, because he was uncomfortable receiving such a large, unsolicited donation. His campaign staff told the Tribune that O’Rourke and Bankman-Fried had not spoken prior to the donation, and it came as a “surprise.”Bankman-Fried personally donated $40 million to largely Democratic candidates, while other FTX executives, including co-CEO Ryan Salame, donated to Republicans. Some, including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who received at least $16,600 from Bankman-Fried, are rushing to wash their hands of the association with the suspect donations, promising to give the money to charity.While O’Rourke returned Bankman-Fried’s October donation, the now-disgraced crypto mogul was the Texas Democrat’s biggest campaign donor during the previous fundraising cycle, from July 1 to Sept. 29, during which Bankman-Fried gave O'Rourke a total of $1 million.O’Rourke’s reluctance to accept the more recent large donation could also have been influenced by the political divisiveness over cryptocurrency in Texas. O’Rourke’s opponent, Republican incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott (who won the election), is a vocal supporter of the crypto industry – particularly crypto mining – in the state.Texas’ unique and fragile power grid has struggled to support the state’s growing energy requirements in recent years, leading to an increase in blackouts.Abbott’s open invitation to bitcoin miners to set up shop in Texas has been criticized, particularly by Democrats, who are concerned the growing presence of crypto miners could further strain the state’s grid.",2022/11/29

279,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Crypto prices rally late, despite crypto lender BlockFi filing for bankruptcy protection and ongoing protests in China over COVID-19 restrictions.Insights: What's the price of irreverence on crypto Twitter? A joke about wrapped ether spooked investors.Bitcoin Rallies Late Despite BlockFi Bankruptcy Protection Filing, China ProtestsBy James RubinCrypto markets spent much of Monday in the red before a late-day rally sent most major tokens into positive territory, even as the industry continued to process the dual body blows of crypto lender BlockFi's Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing and widespread protests in China over severe COVID-19 restrictions.Bitcoin was recently trading at about $16,250, up the better part of a percentage point over the previous 24 hours but still below its weekend perch of $16,500. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization's resilience dovetailed with a wider slowdown in asset activity of all stripes as the U.S. celebrated its annual Thanksgiving holiday and a lull in bad news related to crypto exchange FTX's implosion. The latter pause ended with BlockFi's petition.""We need to see if there's going to be more contagion coming,"" Marco Sampaio, co-founder and CEO of Hashdex, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""We know the macro is also playing a role in this. The pressure coming from China is also putting pressure on crypto or risky assets in general.""But Sampaio added cautiously: ""We need to see what's going to happen. We have many chapters to follow [in] the coming weeks.""Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,175, also up 1.3% from Sunday, same time. Ether's price fell roughly 3% earlier in the day after a ""whale"" address moved 73,224 ETH, worth $85.7 million, to Binance during Asia trading hours, according to an analysis by on-chain researcher Lookonchain. Investors typically transfer coins to centralized exchanges when they intend to sell or use the coins as a margin in derivatives trading.Most other cryptos in the CoinDesk top 20 by market capitalization were recently trading in the green, with popular meme coin DOGE up more than 5%, continuing an almost week-long surge whose spark remains unclear. DOGE alternative SHIB was up about 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, was roughly flat.News of continued demonstrations in China, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and hawkish remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve officials on Monday sent equity markets tumbling with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closing off about 1.5%.Hashdex's Sampaio noted that institutional investors focused on crypto's long-term potential have been less affected by the industry's recent debacles than companies that have been trading and are ""dis-allocating"" their assets. ""We know that markets come and go,"" he said. ""I would say 'give it time.' It's hurting now but we don't think that's going to be the scenario forever.""What's the Price of Irreverence on Crypto TwitterBy Sam ReynoldsOver the weekend, an inside joke that wrapped ether (wETH) was on the verge of insolvency spooked crypto Twitter.Crypto Twitter is understandably twitchy these days, given the rapid market-moving news cycle of the last month. With so many institutions in the crypto economy on the verge of insolvency, the failure of another wouldn’t be surprising. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), protocols and everything in between seem to have been drained or hacked in the last few months.So when a joke popped up suggesting wETH might be next, the gallows humor was apparently real-sounding enough to be taken seriously by some readers without their guards up.Ether sank 4.8% in the ensuing 24 hours, outpacing bitcoin’s drop, although there’s no proof that the decline stemmed from the gag. Token price drops often stem from different factors.More to the point: The idea of wETH failing is really not something that would happen, at least in any traditional sense.What is wETH?First, we need to understand what wETH is. The ""w"" in wETH stands for ""wrapped,"" which means a token representing a fixed amount of another token, usually on a one-to-one basis. ""Wrapping"" is often used to describe representing assets on a different blockchain, as when ""wrapped"" BTC (wBTC) is created to represent bitcoin (BTC) on Ethereum (though wBTC and wETH are very, very different creatures). Wrapping an ether token on the Ethereum network might seem strange then.To summarize a long, technical problem: Ether, the token, doesn’t support the ERC-20 standard that virtually every decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol uses. Ether came before ERC-20; it’s Windows 3.1 in the era of apps and smartphones. So instead of fixing ether, it’s faster to just wrap it in a modern ERC-20 token.But it still is, in essence, another form of ether on the Ethereum blockchain.Why can’t wETH go insolvent?Unlike staked ether (stETH), or bridge protocols that allow you to “transport” tokens to different protocols (i.e., sending Solana-based tokens to Ethereum via Wormhole), wETH doesn’t have a centralized entity. Immutable, open-source smart contracts govern how wETH and ETH interact, and it’s simple to confirm that the wETH contract is fully backed at any given moment. There’s a risk that the smart contracts behind wETH could be hacked. WETH is pegged 1:1, and thanks to block explorers you can easily validate this.It’s transparent, decentralized and all on the same chain. So there’s basically near-zero risk and a depeg is really an issue, even if wETH might trade at a slight discount to ETH from time to time in digital-asset markets.Provided that it’s always possible to unwrap ether, which the smart contracts will do without a centralized authority, wETH will continue to properly function.Data from Dune Analytics shows there was a spike in unwraps over the weekend as the joke went viral.To be sure, this isn’t a bank run. Given that wETH currently trades at a slight discount to ETH, this might have generated more revenue for the protocol.  For traders, the annoyance would primarily be from the gas fees. People might have lost $100, not their entire life savings.Sometimes jokes go too farWETH is a confusing topic. In theory there shouldn’t be a need for it, and eventually Ethereum will evolve to the point where it won’t be needed.But this is less to do with wETH and more to do with how a news cycle based on flashy tweets can cause panic. This joke was a complicated one that required a reader to have the technical context to properly understand it, and to find it funny.

283,"The market contagion from crypto exchange FTX’s swift collapse has spread to a key digital asset: wrapped bitcoin, a widely traded clone of the largest cryptocurrency.According to a new report from crypto analysis firm Kaiko, wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), the largest wrapped version of bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain, has traded at a discount to bitcoin’s price since Sam Bankman-Fried's embattled FTX exchange filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11.Kaiko said WBTC’s discount dropped to as low as 1.5% Friday after investors reacted to questions posed on Twitter about whether WBTC is fully backed. The rumor was based on data from Messari's dashboard on Dune Analysis that says FTX’s sister company, Alameda Research, was a top WBTC merchant by the number of tokens minted.Chen Fang, chief operating officer for BitGo, WBTC's official custodian, quickly clarified that every WBTC is “1:1 backed and verifiable on-chain.”Friday’s rumors “appear to be unfounded” as Alameda would have needed to send all BTC to BitGo, meaning that the now-defunct exchange “never actually took custody of the BTC themselves,” the Kaiko report stated.“Alameda was a ‘WBTC merchant,’ which means they’d accept BTC from customers and send it to BitGo to mint WBTC,” crypto influencer Udi Wertheimer tweeted. “Alameda NEVER custodied BTC themselves!”Despite the clarification, WBTC’s discount is still at 0.5%, according to Kaiko.Wrapped assets like WBTC are meant to be pegged to the value of the original asset. They are often used for trading, lending and borrowing on decentralized-finance (DeFi) platforms.Bitcoin (BTC)’s price was recently trading at $16,143 Monday, while WBTC was changing hands at $16,112.FTX’s fallout gave birth to a phenomenon that Kaiko analysts previously have termed the “Alameda Gap” – a drop in liquidity across various crypto assets in the market, and altcoins’ liquidity took the hits more.Kaiko said market makers are providing liquidity “asymmetrically, with spreads widening a lot more for higher-beta altcoins.”By comparing the average daily spreads for the top altcoins by market cap on the Binance and Coinbase exchanges in the weeks before and after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection, Kaiko found that Solana’s SOL token had seen its spreads widen the most, “tripling from 2.1bps (basis points) to 7.4bps on Binance.”SOL’s price has been falling sharply given its close ties with FTX/Alameda – plunging 59% in the past month. CoinDesk first reported on Alameda's balance sheet on Nov. 2 that the firm held $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.”“Alameda was one of the most important market makers for some small-cap altcoins, while other major market makers registered losses and are likely to review their risk controls, which could impact liquidity in the short term,” the report from Kaiko said.",2022/11/28
284,"Crypto funds had the biggest week of outflows in three months as negative sentiment pervades digital-asset markets following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange, and the contagion to other firms.Outflows for crypto investment products totaled $23 million, the highest amount in 12 weeks and a reversal from a two-week streak of inflows, according to a report by CoinShares on Monday.Investors had scooped up shares in digital-asset funds as crypto prices tanked in the weeks after FTX’s meltdown, but as prices stabilized last week the trend appears to have reversed.The headline figure for outflows is even more bearish than it looks because the week included some $9.2 million of inflows into “short bitcoin” funds, or those designed to profit from further price declines in the largest cryptocurrency by market value.The outflows are still small compared to a spate of some $200 million of redemptions earlier this year, after the bankruptcy of the crypto lender Celsius Network.Outflows from bitcoin (BTC) funds totaled $10 million.Even with the 65% price decline in BTC year to date, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has still netted $322 million of inflows in 2022.“Regionally, the negative sentiment was focused on the U.S., Sweden and Canada, which all saw either outflows from long investment products or inflows into short products,” said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares. “Germany and Switzerland stood out as investors in aggregate, added to long only or sold out of short positions.”Total asset under management (AUM) in digital-asset funds dropped to a new two-year low of $22.2 billion, largely because of this year’s steep price declines.",2022/11/28
285,"According to 99 Bitcoins, a website that tracks crypto obituaries, there have been 466 times someone has declared “game over” for blockchain. That’s almost certainly an undercount, if looking across financial publications, social media and interviews with experts on TV and podcasts. Even amid crypto’s bleakest winter yet, crypto boosters still seem more connected to reality than these forecasters.There’s been a modest uptick in bitcoin obits since the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange. Indian columnist Chetan Bhagat, for instance, wrote that “crypto is now dead” in the Times of India last week. How declarative! Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, who has been calling the end of bitcoin since 2013, recently wrote that the crypto industry is “heading for oblivion.”This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.The Economist took a smarter route, couching its prediction in a question: How will crypto unravel? “If everyone stopped using it,” the vaunted financial magazine wrote. Although its argument is simple (and credulous), it’s worth taking a closer look at because it gets to the heart of why crypto isn’t going to disappear: diminishing trust.According to The Economist, decreasing trust in crypto companies will lead to decreasing use in blockchains thereby opening these decentralized platforms to attack. The bylineless article notes 51% attacks as a particular risk, arguing that blockchain security is a direct output of a cryptocurrency’s price.“The value of on-chain activity and tokens is self-reinforcing … The more people shy away from crypto out of fear, the less secure it becomes,” they write. The more expensive an asset, the harder it is to accumulate the necessary share needed to reverse a transaction on a decentralized network.Astute readers will know that while a 51% attack is an embarrassment for a blockchain (and may diminish trust in the underlying asset), it doesn’t spell the end for the network. Bitcoin Cash, the fork of Bitcoin, for instance experienced two chain attacks in 2021 – it’s still chugging along. (After Ghash.io acquired more than 51% of BTC’s hashpower in 2014, no single entity has had such a large share.)However, the larger idea is more important: Will people ever simply get fed up with crypto and stop using or building on blockchains? The reason this might seem like a salient question to The Economist is the same reason it seems ridiculous to any understanding of crypto. Starting with Bitcoin, decentralized networks are attempts at creating alternative systems where the key distinction is whether you have to trust anyone else to use them.Blockchains live up to the promise of trustlessness with varying degrees of success. It’s also true that the industry has in large part recreated the problem of centralized institutions by relying heavily on corporate exchanges and on-ramps. But when some like Paul Krugman says it’s “never been clear exactly why anyone other than criminals would want” to send payments peer-to-peer, it seems like an acute failure of imagination.Crypto is forward-looking – its key innovations involve long-term societal changes (learning how to self-custody assets, reimagining what money is, creating new ways of collective action). And while today we’re confronted with all the ways crypto can fail, there are still many time lines where it can succeed.Earlier this month, Harvard economist Matthew Ferranti published a research paper looking at the situations under which it makes sense for central banks to hold bitcoin. Likely the product of months of research, Ferranti’s case study was published at a time when its conclusions likely would never seem more ridiculous to his peers.Will bitcoin survive at all, let alone partially replace so-called risk free assets like U.S. Treasurys or dollars? Ferranti’s wager isn’t ideological, but it does presume that even nation-states could have a use for a “sanction-proof” asset like BTC. This case doesn’t even need to play out for bitcoin to succeed – but it would validate the idea that money doesn’t have to have a centralized backer.Crypto doesn’t have to replace finance, bitcoin doesn’t have to become the only money and decentralized protocols don’t need to eliminate companies – but they exist as alternatives.See also: Bitcoin Is 'Armageddon Insurance'? To some extent, even if not a perfect accounting, 99 Bitcoins’ “Bitcoin Obituaries” is an attempt to put data behind a widely shared perception that the media is biased against crypto. At a time when trust in the media is at an all-time low, saying people will lose trust in crypto seems particularly off-the-mark – crypto was always about minimizing faith in people.",2022/11/28
286,"Amid the turmoil of the last few weeks, it’s easy to lose sight of what our industry is about: independence and innovation. These two fundamental drivers of prosperity and progress are not unique to crypto – but only in crypto are they entwined and embodied in liquid assets.One feature of the innovation is the vast range of assets that exist and continue to emerge. Not all will survive, but those that do will have the potential to impact the entire spectrum of economic influence – from individual savers to professional investors, from merchants to financial institutions, from local communities to central banks.Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.Central banks? Yes. While we do not yet have clear examples of central banks embracing crypto, it’s not far off. And the U.S. dollar only has itself to blame.It’s tragically ironic that after a period of the sharpest increase of U.S. money supply in history, nations around the world are suffering an acute shortage of dollars. A couple of days ago, Ghana moved to start paying for oil imports in gold due to a lack of greenbacks. Earlier this month, credit ratings agency Fitch downgraded Nigeria due largely to the central bank’s policy of rationing the supply of U.S. dollars, which has led to fuel scarcity, suspended flights and accelerating inflation.Last month, reports emerged from Egypt of a chronic wheat shortage due to a lack of dollars with which to pay for large shipments of the grain sitting on ships in Egyptian ports. This summer, Sri Lanka found itself unable to pay for fuel, had to close schools and offices and prioritized allocations to counterparties who could pay in dollars. Earlier this year, dollar rationing by Kenyan banks led to food shortages and soaring prices. The list goes on – dollar shortage stress around the globe is triggering hunger, accelerating price spirals and, in some cases, toppling governments.A large part of this is political. The U.S. Federal Reserve has a system of swap lines that dispense dollars to foreign central banks in case of need. But not to all central banks – only Canada, England, Japan, the European Union and Switzerland have access to standing swap lines. In theory, others can get temporary ones in times of crisis, but even during the height of the pandemic, the Fed only provided swap lines to two emerging economies: Brazil and Mexico.See also: Steps to Crypto Recovery: Where 'We' Go From Here | OpinionThe worsening credit profiles of would-be dollar borrowers are a factor in this lack of generosity, as is the concern that U.S. loans might go to repay Chinese debt or finance imports from Russia. And while the U.S. can come to the rescue when total implosion is imminent, as it did for Sri Lanka earlier this year, that intervention can carry conditions that many nations are unable to meet – greater distance from China, for instance.Even holding liquid dollar assets as reserves is not what it used to be. The seizure of Russian reserves at the start of the war in Ukraine has shown central banks that the world’s “safe asset” is not as safe as everyone thought (as for price volatility, well …)Now, what if there were a seizure-resistant monetary asset that was not subject to the economic priorities of third parties and that could be sold for dollars 24/7/365? Oh wait, there is.Attention to the idea of central banks holding bitcoin is growing. In May, the Alliance for Financial Inclusion organized a conference in El Salvador that convened central bankers and financial regulators from 44 countries to discuss small business financing, financial inclusion and bitcoin. Most were from small countries, but not all: representatives from Nigeria, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Egypt – each in the top 50 countries ranked by GDP – were present; beyond Africa and Asia, coverage included nations from the Middle East, Latin America and at least one former Soviet republic.Even academia is getting involved. Last week, Matthew Ferranti of Harvard University’s economics department published a paper on, you guessed it, central banks and bitcoin. Technically the paper is about the risk of sanctions on central bank reserves and is one of the first to focus on the impact of sanctions before they happen, via hedging and the resulting effect on the reserves composition. Ferranti concludes that the shifting global landscape makes a case for the inclusion of cryptocurrency in that mix, and produces a whole lot of formulas and numbers to back that up. The renminbi gets a shout-out, too.Read more: After FTX: Rebuilding Trust in Crypto's Founding Mission | OpinionCentral banks do seem to be re-evaluating their allocations. A recent report by the World Gold Council revealed that third-quarter gold purchases had jumped 18% year on year, with central banks accounting for a quarterly record of 400 tonnes (the previous record was 241 tonnes in Q3 2018). Central bank purchases for the year to date reached 673 tonnes at the end of September, higher than any other full year total since 1967.But it is no secret that even gold reserves are vulnerable. The New York Federal Reserve building holds the world’s largest known monetary gold reserve, much of which belongs to foreign central banks. Access to gold reserves, whether physical or paper, is not 100% guaranteed. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a bearer asset that is not expensive or complicated to store securely on national territory, a few clicks away from a market.It’s even possible the embrace of bitcoin by emerging economy central banks could be with U.S. support. The alternative is U.S. lending to high-risk countries, which carries a domestic political cost; the expansion of non-dollar swap agreements, such as with China; or the collapse of some emerging and frontier economies. Apart from the human tragedy, many are key commodity exporters.See also: Bitcoin Is Macro, but Not 'Correlated' in the Way You Think | OpinionI used to think the adoption of bitcoin by central banks for their reserves would happen soon, given the urgent need in some pockets of the global economy – now I realize that getting regulators comfortable with the idea, especially after the high level of misunderstanding of what the FTX collapse is actually about (i.e., fraud, not crypto), could take some time. But it is becoming increasingly clear to me that it will happen, because it needs to happen. The doubt and distrust sown by recent crypto drama will recede, and the desperate need to shore up economic resilience – combined with a growing understanding of the relative simplicity of an asset that can be converted into dollars or any other currency at any time – will incentivize greater acceptance and experimentation.We are also likely to see a domino effect: Where one goes, so will others. And with this, the world will witness an asset that started retail-first, from the ground up, ending up as a support for not just central banks but also the resilience of entire nations.",2022/11/28

Most questions involve the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange FTX, with some scrutinizing the investment made by state fund Temasek in the fallen enterprise.Since the collapse, the country's financial regulator, the MAS, has also had to answer questions about how it decides which crypto exchanges are safe for use by investors.In August, the MAS said that it was working with other regulators on setting up a prudential framework for banks' exposure to crypto. Shanmugaratnam said on Monday that Singapore is following the requirements recommended by international standard-setter the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). BCBS is set to finalize capital requirements for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether by the end of the year.Until that framework is finalized, the MAS is going with the ""highest risk weight under the BCBS’ capital framework,"" according to Shanmugaratnam.""For less risky crypto assets, such as tokenized corporate bonds that meet a set of conditions to ensure that they pose the same level of financial risks as traditional corporate bonds, the prudential treatment is similar to that applied to the traditional non-tokenized asset,"" Shanmugaratnam said.Read more: Banks’ Crypto Asset Holdings May Be Just 0.01% of Total Risk Exposure, Basel Study Finds",2022/11/28
288,"Crypto market regulatory initiatives that are already underway are likely to be accelerated in the wake of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and sister company Alameda Research, JPMorgan said in a research report Thursday.For example, after the European Parliament gives final approval to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill, it will take 18 months before the regulation takes effect but FTX's collapse could shorten the timeline, the report said.The bank notes that U.S. regulatory initiatives garnered more interest after the Terra network collapsed in May because of a “perceived need for increased oversight and consumer protections.” The collapse of crypto exchange FTX this month is also likely to lead to a greater sense of urgency.Regulatory initiatives are likely to emerge focusing on custody and protection of customers’ digital assets, the unbundling of broker/trading/lending/clearing/custody activities, and transparency and the reporting of reserves, assets and liabilities, the note said.JPMorgan says crypto derivatives trading will probably shift to regulated venues, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will likely to benefit from that change.The bank says it is “skeptical of a structural shift” away from centralized exchanges to decentralized exchanges (DEXes). DEXes wouldn't work for the size of orders coming from larger institutions because of slower transaction speeds or because the institutions’ trading strategies and order size would be traceable on the blockchain, the note said.Read more: Bernstein Says Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Is Protected From Fallout at Sibling Company Genesis Global",2022/11/28

Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Dogecoin soared more than 16% over the past 24 hours and is up more than 50% since last Tuesday.Insights: Ethereum Name service selects Karpatkey DAO to manage Its endowment fundDogecoin Surges; Other Cryptos Trade FlatBy James RubinOn a quiet holiday weekend in cryptocurrency markets, DOGE made some noise.The popular meme coin soared 16% over the previous 24 hours and was trading at more than 10 cents. DOGE has risen nearly 50% since last Monday with most of its gains occurring during U.S. Thanksgiving holiday celebrations, which started on Thursday. The reasons for the spike were difficult to pinpoint, although social media influencer David Gokhshtein mused to his more than 700,000 Twitter followers on Thursday about the possibility of new Twitter boss Elon Musk and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin working together on DOGE improvement.""I feel that we’ll all see Vitalik and Elon working together to somehow upgrade $DOGE,"" Gokhshstein wrote.Investors fretting another post FTX-related price plunge in crypto markets could otherwise take heart at bitcoin's resilience, although the largest cryptocurrency's ability to hold its perch over $16,000 for yet another few days hardly suggests a more permanent upturn is approaching, a number of analysts have said. BTC was recently trading at about $16,500, roughly flat for the past 24 hours and about where it stood Wednesday when the U.S. began its Thanksgiving holiday celebrations.""It's trying to stabilize around the $15,500-$17,000 region and weather the storm but I'm not sure it will be that easy,"" wrote Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda.Traditional markets were closed on Thursday and stock trading the following day was light as many businesses closed, including major financial services firms.

Aside from DOGE, most cryptos in the CoinDesk top 20 also traded sideways, although XLM recently rose more than 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, was up about 1%.Oanda's Erlam was less than sanguine about crypto markets as the fallout widens from crypto exchange FTX's implosion earlier this month.""There's likely more to come from the FTX collapse and the contagion effects, not to mention potentially other scandals that could be uncovered,"" Erlam wrote. ""This may continue to make crypto traders very nervous and leave the foundations supporting price extremely shaky.""Ethereum Name Service Selects Karpatkey DAO to Manage Its Endowment FundBy Sage D. YoungThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) has chosen a new fund manager to take charge in managing its treasury in the wake of crypto winter.In a vote that opened Nov. 17 and closed on Nov. 22, community members selected Karpatkey DAO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) fund management organization originally incubated through Gnosis Ltd.Karpatkey received 1.76 million votes. Notable addresses that picked Karpatkey include ENS co-founder Alex Van de Sande (avsa.eth), founder of Rotkiapp Lefteris Karapetsas (lefteris.eth) and ENS steward Griff Green (griff.eth), who altogether had a voting power of 468K ENS.“None of the above” came in second place with 1.3 million votes.Now that the community has chosen Karpatkey, the treasury management firm in collaboration with Steakhouse Financial, going forward, will manage the bulk of ENS’ treasury composed mostly of USDC and ETH. With more than two years of experience, Karpatkey boasts over $397 million of non-custodial assets under management, excluding ENS.The goal of the endowment fund, called ENS Endaoment, is to create a sustainable fund that can fuel continuous development regardless of macroeconomics conditions that may adversely affect revenue stemming from ENS registrations and renewals. Talks of the ENS Endaoment were happening as early as March before the crises related to Terra, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and FTX, according to Nicholas Johnson, one of three directors for the ENS Foundation, and Mona El Isa, CEO and founder of Avantgarde, one of the potential fund managers up for consideration.Karpatkey said in its proposal, “The funds would be managed transparently and completely on-chain through a non-custodial solution … The core of Karpatkey’s non-custodial solution relies on the most battle-tested tooling to manage DAO treasuries: a proxy Management Safe and the Zodiac Roles Modifier.”Zodiac, developed by Gnosis Guild, is “a collection of tools built according to an open standard” as said on its Github page, while Safe, securing close to $40 billion in all its Ethereum contracts, is one of the most popular ways to custody digital assets in a decentralized manner.$52 million is the initial size of Karpatkey’s proposal for the ENS Endaoment and $69 million with a projected return of 5.83% is the final stage of Karpatkey’s proposal. “The strategy would use low-risk, medium complexity DeFi strategies such as providing liquidity to automated market makers.”In an interview with CoinDesk, Karpatkey’s business development manager who goes by ""DeFi Foodie"" on Twitter, said, “It’s been a great exchange that has been in the forum, on the diversity of voices, how everybody could just give their opinion openly. And that’s been really healthy for ENS DAO because people can just speak their minds and have civil exchanges. When the forum asks questions [and] challenge[s] points, I think that’s something that is rich for the community and favorable.”El Isa told CoinDesk that if a fund manager endorses a non-custodial, completely transparent solution, such as Enzyme, Avantgarde's proposal choice for a decentralized asset and treasury management protocol, for the ENS Endaoment, it “would be the first example of something being run completely on-chain”, where a FTX or Bernie Madoff situation “wouldn’t be possible.""8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(00:30 UTC) Australia’s Retail Sales s.a.

291,"Crypto in November has basically been a mess because of the fall of FTX.Enough doomscrolling. We’re entering the Thanksgiving (in the U.S.) and year-end holiday season. So here are some crypto-related things that I am, and you should be, thankful for.There is much to be thankful for.You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.Leave it to a bitcoin maximalist to make this about Bitcoin somehow. But it’s true. I am thankful that through all this turmoil, Bitcoin is ticking along. Blocks are still being mined and the network has nary a hiccup.And not only is Bitcoin working, but bitcoiners are working. We’ve seen both meaningful discussions around self-custody (plus exchange outflows have broken historical records) and developers are developing new useful tools (plus an announcement of an announcement of an old idea).What’s more, bitcoin is trading around $16,000. With public bitcoin miners struggling, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) trading at a record discount to net asset value, Genesis Global Capital hiring a financial adviser after disclosing losses and suspending redemptions, and most bitcoin holders holding their bitcoins at a loss, bitcoin remaining steady around a $16,000 price level is nothing short of remarkable.(Grayscale and Genesis Global Capital are both owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)Tick tock, next block.Why you should be thankful: When times are tough, people show you who they are; so do crypto protocols. Times are tough and investors and enthusiasts alike should take solace in the fact that Bitcoin is a sewer rat and will come out of this stronger.Of course, as a bitcoin maximalist, my main criticism of crypto’s decentralized finance (DeFi) sub-industry is that it is mainly used as a circular, closed-loop model for gambling. Things like yield farming, play-to-earn, liquidity pools and the like might have some utility, but it does seem that most are just different flavors of speculation on coins.Still, the financial pain that has been wrought this month wasn’t DeFi’s fault. The failure of FTX was a failure of trusted third parties and people.Why you should be thankful: Even if speculation is the use case for DeFi and crypto, there is something to be said that the protocols didn’t break when FTX went down. If you think companies and institutions should crop up around crypto, this is simply a lesson in building better companies and institutions rather than a declaration that there’s nothing to be built around this technology, movement or whatever.Genuinely.Last week I wrote about FTX-related contagion: “Crypto is simply not big enough to have a serious impact on the broader economy.” I wrote something similar in May right after the Terra crash led to $40 billion in losses: “Except next time an undercollateralized, algorithmic stablecoin fails, it’s not going to be $40 billion of lost value. It might be $400 billion. That could be catastrophic.”The crypto market is small now, so the tendrils of its reach are also small. This “contagion” should blow over without touching the non-crypto economy.Why you should be thankful: Whatever dies in crypto because of FTX’s downfall dies without too many far-reaching effects.Following the FTX bankruptcy filing, industry professionals were calling for exchanges to implement proof of reserves. Proof of reserves should provide an assurance to customers that exchanges are in fact holding their funds. (I wrote about it here.) A less-talked-about aspect of proof of reserves that should be more talked about is the idea that we might run into an issue regarding the total amount of circulating bitcoin crypto exchanges say they have.Why you should be thankful: The ability to hold your own coins is part of the value proposition of most cryptocurrencies. From the perspective of the Bitcoin system, one of the value propositions is that there is a finite, provably scarce number of bitcoin. If exchanges were found to be circulating an amount in excess of the number of bitcoin issued (i.e., they are selling paper, fake bitcoins rather than real bitcoins) we could: a) out some bad-faith actors in the space and b) see some crazy price movement as the demand for “real, actual” bitcoin spikes dramatically.Lastly, a shameless plug and unprompted advertisement for my employer and colleagues.

293,"Cøbra, the pseudonymous operator of bitcoin.org must reveal their identity should they want to contest legal costs demanded by the self-proclaimed inventor of Bitcoin, Craig Wright, in a lawsuit, the High Court in London has ruled.The costs against Cøbra were awarded in a copyright case related to the the Bitcoin white paper, the cryptocurrency's founding manifesto. Wright, an Australian computer scientist, has long claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin. He accused Cøbra and bitcoin.org of infringing his rights after the website published the white paper, attributed to Satoshi. Wright sought a declaration that, as Satoshi, he owned the copyright.Wright was granted permission to serve legal papers on Cøbra in April 2021. That June, after Cøbra failed to appear in court, a judge issued a default order to Cøbra to take down the white paper.This is not Wright's first spin about a courtroom. He suffered a loss this October in Norway, where he was sued for claiming and failing to prove that he is Satoshi. The judge in the case ruled there was enough evidence that Wright had lied and cheated in his attempts to prove he was indeed the inventor of the cryptocurrency. Wright is appealing that ruling, his legal team said.Read more: UK Court Orders Bitcoin.org to Remove White Paper Following Craig Wright LawsuitUnidentified defendants are typically not required to reveal themselves and their addresses in similar cases.

""Until that has occurred, the court cannot take notice of the points of dispute that have been served.""Rowley also said that should Cøbra not wish to unmask themselves, they can request anonymization. That, however, will not prevent the claimant from learning their name.""I accept that that does not generally prevent the opponent from knowing who the party is, but that is the extent to which a party can be involved in proceedings and limit their identification,"" the ruling said.Cøbra has 21 days from Thursday to appeal and another 14 to ""identify themselves if they are going to do so.""""In the absence of either an appeal or an identification, the claimant will be at liberty to seek a default costs certificate in five weeks’ time,"" the ruling said.The document also revealed that, after the default judgment last June, ""the judge declined to carry out any summary assessment of the costs and ordered that they should go for detailed assessment.""

294,"One of the best ways to participate in the crypto market next year is by consistently offering insurance against a bitcoin (BTC) price rally, according to crypto services provider Matrixport.The strategy, known as systematic call option overwriting, often outperforms a buy-and-hold approach in a market without a strong bullish direction, and Matrixport said it doesn't foresee a raging bitcoin bull market in 2023.""'The 'weekly systematic call overwriting strategy' could be a winner as the industry likely moves through several months of uncertainty,"" Markus Thielen, Matrixport's head of research at strategy, said in a note to clients on Friday.Overwriting involves regularly selling weekly expiry call options while owning the underlying asset. In effect it means offering insurance against price increases to the counterparty, because they have the right – but not the obligation – to buy the asset at the predetermined price on or before the expiry date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market and compensates the seller for offering insurance by paying a premium.For the seller, the premium adds extra percentage points of income to their annual return. The extra income is limited to the size of the premium.An example of call overwriting is when an investor owns one bitcoin and sells a call option on it at a strike price that's higher than the current market price. For example, giving the option buyer the right to purchase the bitcoin at, say $20,000, when the current price is $16,400. If the price tops $20,000 before the option expires, the option buyer has an opportunity to make a profit.The strategy, however, exposes the overwriter to the risk of missing out on a large increase in bitcoin's price. As a call seller, they are obligated to sell the underlying asset if the option buyer wants to exercise their purchase right, which is likely when the market price moves above the strike level.""The biggest risk for this strategy is a raging bull market with high volatility due to excessive leverage returns, as we have seen in early-to-mid 2021,"" Thielen said, downplaying the prospect of a renewed upside volatility explosion in 2023.""Since the summer of 2021, exchanges have cut down on leverage, and offering customers excessive leverage seems unlikely in a post-FTX crypto world when the regulator will likely take a close look at retail’s ability to access leverage,"" Thielen noted.The demand for and prices of options are closely tied to the degree of uncertainty in the market, realized – or historical – volatility and expectations for price turbulence, also known as implied volatility. And volatility is mean-reverting, so seasoned traders sell options (call, put or both) when volatility is elevated and buy options when volatility is cheap.According to Thielen, the recent implosion of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX and resulting contagion fears have lifted implied volatility, making call options pricier. Therefore, now is a good time to overwrite calls.""The recent stress in the crypto world has lifted volatility above the five-year moving average. The rise in volatility has increased the value of calls. Hence this strategy has become even more attractive now as the strategy can sell calls for a higher premium,"" Thielen said.According to Matrixport's back-testing models, the systematic call overwriting strategy would have generated double-digit annualized returns in the past two years.

297,"Good morning. This is an abbreviated version of First Mover Asia because the team is out of the office today for a CoinDesk company holiday in the U.S. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin holds its $16,500 perch as the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday weekend begins.Insights: Jocelyn Yang writes about the domino effect caused by the the downfall of FTX.Bitcoin Trades Sideways, Holds Over $16.5KBy James RubinBitcoin's price barely budged on the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $16,500, down a mere 0.11% over the past 24 hours. BTC has been holding steady around $16,000 for the past three weeks, although it took a brief dip below $15,500 on Monday amid fears about the future of crypto trading and lending firm Genesis Global Capital, which has been caught up in crypto platform FTX's implosion.Crypto markets calmed over the past three days, however, buoyed along with equity indexes by signs that the U.S. central bank would retreat from its current diet of hawkish 75 basis point interest rate hikes. While a number of crypto observers say the recent debacles may ultimately strengthen the crypto industry by forcing regulators to ratchet up their efforts, most analysts remain bearish about prices.Ether (ETH) was recently changing hands at about $1,195, up 1.16% over the past day. Other cryptos were mixed, with Cardano's ADA down almost a percentage point (-0.96%) and Quant (QNT) trading up 0.32%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, was down 0.26%.FTX Contagion Revives Dreaded 2022 Crypto Knell – the ‘Withdrawal Halt’By Jocelyn YangIn the crypto industry in 2022, the phrase ""halting withdrawals"" is like black smoke billowing out of a building. Damage is certain.Technically, it means that a crypto exchange or lender has gated customers from being able to get their money or digital tokens back – typically because there just aren't enough assets on hand to meet redemption requests. The likely upshot, though, is that the business is unlikely to recover easily from the destruction. In many cases, a bankruptcy filing is the next step.Now, the rapid unraveling of once-billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire, including the FTX exchange and the crypto trading firm Alameda Research, has unleashed a fresh wave of crypto exchanges and lenders halting customers’ withdrawals over the past few weeks.The collateral damage lengthens a list of casualties from the dramatic collapse of the Terra blockchain earlier this year, which accelerated or led directly to the failures of crypto firms including Celsius Network, Babel Finance, Voyager Digital and Three Arrows Capital.(CoinDesk counts 16 distinct withdrawal-halt announcements this year; the list is below.)The contagion can spread swiftly. When one company suddenly refuses redemption requests, another company suddenly faces a liquidity crisis. Market jitters unnerve investors, leading to further withdrawal requests, exacerbating the panic. Such is the pattern in digital-asset markets where there is no Federal Reserve or other central bank backstopping it all – as there is in the traditional financial system.“For each player, you're going to be in this situation where all of a sudden you have to manage how much information you want to reveal,” said Benoit Bosc, global head of product at crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR. “It might be more information than you actually want to reveal then.”BlockFi, a crypto lender, paused client withdrawals from its platform on Nov. 10, citing the “lack of clarity” around FTX's current situation; this move came two days after the FTX exchange fully halted customer withdrawals on Nov. 8. BlockFi later acknowledged its “significant exposure” to FTX.Last week, Genesis, a big crypto financial firm, announced its lending unit had suspended redemptions and new loan originations, citing “the extreme market dislocation and loss of industry confidence caused by the FTX implosion.” Earlier in the year, the business suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses after Three Arrows Capital’s failure. (Genesis is a CoinDesk sister company.)Bosc cited Warren Buffett’s oft-repeated quote: “‘When the tide goes out, you see who is swimming naked.’”Nicholas Colas, co-founder of the market analysis firm DataTrek Research, wrote in a note that the current crisis will take time to be resolved, and “until then this space will likely see more selling pressure.”The following is a timeline of crypto firms’ withdrawal suspensions in the past few weeks:Nov. 8: The FTX exchange halted customer withdrawals, an FTX support employee said in the company's official Telegram group.Nov. 10: Crypto lender BlockFi halted withdrawals from its platform, citing the “lack of clarity” around FTX's current situation at that time. (In a Nov. 14 update, the lender acknowledged its “significant exposure” to FTX.)Nov. 11: FTX US ceased processing crypto withdrawals. The same day, FTX Group companies – including FTX Trading and FTX US – filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S.Nov. 13: The Hong Kong-based crypto exchange AAX said it had suspended withdrawals for as long as 10 days due to ​​the failure of an unidentified third party. The company said it had no financial exposure to FTX or its affiliates. On Nov. 23, AAX announced it would close out derivatives positions.Nov. 15: The Japanese crypto exchange Liquid, owned by FTX, suspended both fiat and crypto withdrawals on its Liquid Global platform “in compliance with the requirements of voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings in the United States.” The exchange announced on Nov. 20 that it had paused all forms of trading on its platform.Nov. 15: Crypto lending platform SALT said it had halted all deposits and withdrawals on its platform due to FTX exposure.Nov. 16: Crypto investment bank Genesis Global Trading’s lending unit temporarily suspended redemptions and new loan originations, citing “the extreme market dislocation and loss of industry confidence caused by the FTX implosion.”Nov. 16: The Winklevoss brothers’ Gemini exchange said it was pausing withdrawals on its yield-earning Earn program as the exchange suffered a $485 million rush of outflows following Genesis' announcement earlier in the day. Genesis Global Trading powered the Earn program for Gemini.And here is a timeline of withdrawal suspensions from earlier this year:June 12: Celsius Network says that it is “pausing all withdrawals, swaps and transfers between accounts.” (Celsius filed for bankruptcy on July 13.)June 17: Babel says “redemptions and withdrawals from Babel Finance products will be temporarily suspended.”June 23: CoinFLEX announces it is “pausing all withdrawals.”July 1: Voyager Digital says it is “temporarily suspending trading, deposits, withdrawals and loyalty rewards.” (Voyager filed for bankruptcy protection on July 5.)July 4: Vauld says that it “made the difficult decision to suspend all withdrawals, trading and deposits.”July 20: Zipmex says that it is “pausing withdrawals until further notice.”August 2: ZB.com announces that ""deposit and withdrawal services are now suspended"" after losing nearly five million in a suspected hack.August 8: Hodlnaut says it ""will be halting withdrawals, token swaps and deposits with immediate effect.""3:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:00 UTC) Germany's Gross Domestic Product (QoQ)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""The Hash"" on CoinDesk TV:Litecoin Surges; El Salvador Proposes Digital Securities Bill, Paves Way for Bitcoin Bonds""The Hash"" hosts discussed the top stories including El Salvador's national assembly mulling a draft bill to regulate digital securities which could pave the way for issuing bitcoin-backed bonds.

298,"Cryptocurrencies without an issuer such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are not securities, Belgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority said Thursday.The regulator said it was getting an increasing number of questions about the regulatory treatment of crypto and hoped to address the most frequently occurring gray areas, including when digital assets can be classified as securities.In jurisdictions such as the U.S., squabbles over when crypto is a security have led to court proceedings, with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying Ripple Labs should have registered its cryptocurrency XRP.The Belgian rule “is neutral as regards technology,” FSMA added, suggesting that classification as a financial instrument or security shouldn’t depend on whether an asset uses a blockchain or something more traditional.The rules, which largely mirror those set out in a July consultation, say that transferable instruments with an issuer are likely to constitute a security. That means they must produce an honest prospectus of information for potential investors, and must apply an European Union law known as MiFID, which requires financiers to be clear and to avoid conflicts of interest. But cryptocurrencies like bitcoin don't count as they don't have an issuer.Even if those rules don’t apply, there are still existing requirements on crypto companies to apply anti-money laundering procedures, the guidance said. A new EU law known as the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) is also due to take effect in the coming years – and will require new crypto offerings to produce a white paper, comparable to a stock prospectus.Belgian rules passed in 2014 make it unlawful for professionals to distribute financial products based on crypto to retail clients.Read more: Brussels’ Fledgling Crypto Industry Flexes Its Muscles",2022/11/24
299,"The last few weeks have been among the craziest that the crypto markets have ever seen. The once-trusted exchange FTX (and all the FTX associated companies), led by founder Sam Bankman-Fried, has filed bankruptcy after the exchange was discovered to be insolvent.Many crypto exchanges have failed in the past, losing client funds and causing many people to lose the money they had on the exchange. Crypto exchanges failing, unfortunately, is not an uncommon event in crypto, but the scale of fraud and mismanagement with FTX is unprecedented. These recent events have caused many in traditional finance to lose faith in the future of crypto, put tremendous downward pressure on crypto prices and lead many to call for further regulation in the crypto markets.For the crypto investor, it is important to note these failures and astronomical losses are due to fraud, mismanagement of client funds and incompetence – not the failure of the software or blockchains themselves. As the fallout from these corporate failures continues, it is important for advisors to understand best practices for themselves and their clients who continue to invest in cryptocurrencies.You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.There’s a popular saying in crypto, “Not your keys, not your coins.” Cryptocurrency is a bearer asset. Meaning, the person or entity who controls the private keys to a crypto wallet essentially owns the coins held in that wallet.By contrast, when a client decides to custody assets with an exchange or third party, they are trusting that party to properly secure the private keys to their holdings. Many exchanges have, unfortunately, mismanaged client assets, either by not protecting the private keys and creating an opportunity for a malicious actor to steal the funds or by blatantly misusing client deposits for their own purposes.The safest way for anyone to hold cryptocurrency is in a wallet that they control. This can be done with a hardware wallet, such as a ledger, a paper wallet or in their own software wallet. This is called “self-custody” of assets. As long as the user does not share the private keys with anyone, no one can steal or misuse the assets without accessing the private keys. It is important to note that the cryptographic foundation that cryptocurrencies use is nearly impossible to hack, creating tremendous security for assets held in a private wallet.For many investors, this creates an additional level of complexity when investing in cryptocurrency. There’s a certain level of technological knowledge required to use the self-custody method of storing crypto. However, in the spirit of complete security, it is worth learning how to do this.Advisors should consider educating their clients on this method. If done correctly, it will prevent client funds from being stolen or misused by a third party.Read more: Multisignature Wallets Can Keep Your Coins Safer (If You Use Them Right)Not all crypto exchanges are held to the same standard. Many exchanges do hold themselves to the highest standard of protecting client deposits. Certain exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini are governed by strict regulations and are not allowed to mix client assets without user permission.Some exchanges publish audited financials and prove that they hold client assets 1:1. They often publish reports showing “proof of reserves,” which essentially prove their solvency. This means the exchange holds all client deposits in a secure wallet and that user deposits can be withdrawn at client discretion. The exchange or custodian does not mix client assets with corporate assets or use client deposits for their own trading or market making.While this is one measure of security better than a lot of offshore exchanges, the exchange is still holding private keys to control and own the crypto. When users elect to hold deposits with a third party, they are essentially trusting the third party to properly secure the private keys to their coins.While using a regulated custodian and exchange is easier and more convenient than self-custody of assets, it is not as secure. Many exchanges have an impeccable track record of protecting client assets, and thus far have proven to be trustworthy. It is important to know that anytime custody is outsourced, the investor is trusting that the third party will properly hold and use client assets.Read more: What Are 'Fully Backed' Reserves?Many “crypto banks” including Celsius Network and Voyager Digital have filed for bankruptcy in 2022. These crypto banks offered a yield-like service where users could hold crypto with the company and generate yield on assets. These companies would lend out user deposits to borrowers (many of whom were hedge funds and institutional investors), passing on the interest charged to depositors, in a bank-like fashion.These centralized finance (CeFi) companies were not regulated like banks, and unfortunately their lending standards and practices were not adequate. Sparked by the crypto sell-off that started in the summer of 2022, many of these CeFi businesses were over leveraged and eventually lost customer funds. CeFi companies are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and their failures will likely result in a total loss of customer funds.While we’ve seen these CeFi companies fail, it is important to note that many of the large decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are still fully operational and are continuing to work as designed. Interacting with a DeFi protocol is more involved than using a CeFi platform. DeFi still offers investors the ability to generate yield on their crypto positions without trusting a third party to properly manage asset security. It is important to note that many DeFi protocols are still considered risky investments and must be properly understood and analyzed before use.Read more: CeFi Broke. But DeFi Is Not Without BlameWhile the last few weeks have been difficult for many in the crypto space, it is important to note that these frauds and catastrophes are due to human and corporate failures, not a failure of the technology that powers cryptocurrencies. Blockchains including Bitcoin and Ethereum are still fully operational and secure, and they offer opportunities for those that believe in the future disruption the technology offers.It is important for all investors to understand the risk they take when they outsource custody and it is worth learning how to self-custody assets and interact directly with DeFi protocols in order to protect their crypto investments.",2022/11/24

How low will prices sink?Yet, Sergei Ivano, CEO at crypto lending and borrowing platform Hexn.io, believes the crisis will leave the industry stronger by weeding out weaker companies, encouraging others to be more transparent and fostering stronger regulatory efforts.“Recent events connected to FTX and Alameda Research (FTX’s research and trading arm) are positive for the whole industry because they have triggered deleverage,” Ivano said. “All weak and unprofitable businesses that have grown during (the) bullish phase of 2020-2021 will face problems if they don’t understand risk-management and principles of dealing in a bearish market.”Ivano noted that markets are weak and that institutions are facing significant outflows. “On-chain metrics reveals that large and old addresses in Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to grow,” he said.“Customers don't trust centralized entities, choosing [decentralized finance] protocols instead and withdrawing their funds from centralized markets,” he added, but said this situation will change in the next several months,” when the current stressful period ends.He believes that the slapdash business practices and accounting procedures that enabled not only FTX’s implosion (and Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing but other debacles over the past six months, including the crumbling of the Terra ecosystem and Chapter 15 bankruptcy filing by crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, will spur “more strict regulation.”“Regulators will require more information about the structure of balances of centralized exchanges and platforms,” Ivano said.Yet, he also paused over some companies current efforts to share information about their reserves. “Leaders of industry are trying to publish proof of reserves of their companies, but these proofs are funny because this information is useless without knowledge about obligations of companies,” he said. “Proper way to implement such report is to publish reserves and obligations in the same time.”5:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(9:00 UTC) Germany's IFO - Business Climate (Nov)5:45 a.m. HKT/SGT(21:45 UTC) New Zealand Retail Sales (QoQ)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Sam Bankman-Fried's Mea Culpa; Kraken Incoming CEO on Crypto's FutureFTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried ""froze up in the face of pressure"" as his company collapsed, he wrote in a new letter sent to employees of the company he once helmed.

This time last year, as bitcoin and ether were setting new all-time highs, you probably looked like a genius for being able to explain what a “decentralized autonomous organization” or non-fungible token is. Well, times have changed.The crypto economy has collapsed but you could still come out looking smart this holiday. And what better way to ease tense conversations than by explaining your way through them. This is CoinDesk’s definitive guide to explaining what broke in crypto this year and why it was in no way your fault. No way, no how!This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.First, the economic context! Crypto is a risk asset that benefited greatly after governments turned on the money spigots to keep their economies floating amid the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. This was after about a decade of “cheap money,” where the U.S. Federal Reserve deliberately kept interest rates low to encourage people to spend and invest rather than save.Investors – from thrill-seeking venture capitalists to pension funds – were indirectly encouraged to seek out ever-riskier bets. And there sat crypto, looking pretty on the far end of the risk curve, ready to soak up excess liquidity. Well, once inflation started to rear its ugly head, and Jerome Powell decided to cool a “temporarily” hot economy, of course crypto would take a hit.Who could’ve predicted that? Certainly not anyone who thought a 20% savings rate on Terra's Anchor protocol looked SAFU.OK, so maybe you did say last year that the upcoming Ethereum Merge would be a great buying opportunity. But are you any more responsible for getting your family and friends to invest than someone like Tom Brady? This fella, an American Treasure, staked his entire reputation on FTX, the now-defunct crypto exchange.Crypto hype cycles tend to be self-reinforcing – as soon as the number goes up, there’s a natural tendency for it to keep going as more and more people remember that they opened a Coinbase account in 2017. (This is Bitcoin’s patented “number go up” technology, which works until it doesn’t.)See also: NFL Legend Tom Brady Caught in FTX FalloutMany people, however, won’t be convinced to buy crypto by rising prices alone. Instead, they need a little encouragement. Enter the “celebrity influencer.” Crypto didn’t invent the idea of selling products to fans, or the odd psychological trait where people form parasocial relationships and begin trusting people they don’t even know. But it is a natural fit.Kim Kardashian boosted “ethereumMax.” Larry David made FTX seem lovable even to curmudgeons. Matt Damon told us investing in crypto was an act of courage. Should anyone have taken investment advice from these people? Well, they had to get rich and/or beautiful (maybe not Larry) somehow …Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX and the hedge fund Alameda Research, built a celebrity reputation of his own. The supposedly ethical billionaire, who donated to and founded nonprofits and ate vegan, spent as much money on charity as on advertisements. Just as people trust people like Tom Brady, we learned to believe in Sam.But even if the vision Bankman-Fried was selling wasn’t a scam, it still wasn’t “crypto,” you could say. As many have pointed out since the collapse of the once $32 billion dollar crypto exchange, the type of mismanagement of customer funds that happened at FTX could have only happened on a custodial platform.See also: Who's Who in the FTX Inner CircleDeFi, or decentralized finance, never takes ownership of users’ funds, and so cannot abuse them. Further, throughout the bear market, many DeFi platforms have functioned exactly as they should have by following prewritten rules set in code – liquidating anyone that should have been liquidated.It’s a fairer system.

304,"The Commitment of Traders report shows asset managers reduced their open long positions by 559 contracts last week. This marks the second consecutive week of declines, as long positions decreased by 132 in the prior report.Asset managers now account for 31% of open long positions on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), down from 43.4% a week prior. The reduction simply means that asset managers now account for a smaller percentage of bullish investors on the CME for the moment. The Commitment of Traders report is a weekly snapshot of open positions on the CME.Leveraged funds, by contrast, increased their long positions by 1,367 contracts following a previous 1,694 contract increase. Leveraged funds now account for 30% of the open interest for long positions on the CME, and 51% of the open interest in short positions.Fewer open long positions by asset managers generally means reduced exposure to BTC prices. Amid the recent downturn, bitcoin's price is down 20% for November, and appear to be building a base of resistance around $16,500.For leveraged funds, increased long positions could be a byproduct of funds buying futures contracts which currently trade at a discount to spot prices. This condition, referred to as backwardation is generally a bearish sign for markets.Current bearishness will continue to pressure BTC markets in what has been a prolonged crypto winter. At current prices, just 45% of BTC supply is in profit, down from 70% in the beginning of 2022.Bitcoin's percent supply in profit has been lower in the past however, falling to 43% in March 2020, and as low as 39% in 2015. Historically, declines in percent supply in profit have marked short-term price bottoms for bitcoin.Another note of concern is the reduction in net positions for miners, which coincides with an increased hashrate and an uptick in BTC being sent to exchanges.As hashrate increases, the prospects for miners to generate a profit become more challenging.

306,"Kraken’s chief operating officer said crypto’s future will be based on self-custody and clear regulatory standards.Dave Ripley, currently the crypto exchange’s COO and named to replace CEO Jesse Powell when he steps down, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” that Kraken is a supporter of self-custody.Asked how his centralized exchange (CEX) could be trusted after the implosion of rival exchange FTX, he responded:“One of the things that is really critical to this system is that it is the only place in the world where you can actually take control [and] own ownership of your own assets in a digital format.”Read more: What Is a CEX? Centralized Exchanges ExplainedStill, “it is not easy” to maintain client trust despite the exchange’s guardrails, according to Ripley. He said FTX’s misuse of customer funds will only put more emphasis on the need for proof of reserves.“Individuals are going to ask for proof as opposed to just blind trust in centralized third parties,” Ripley said.Proof of reserves is an auditing technique to confirm whether assets are, in fact, available. Ripley said Kraken has undergone two proof of reserves this year, with another planned for the start of the new year.Read more: ‘Proof of Reserves’ Emerges as a Favored Way to Prevent Another FTXRipley said the relationship between centralized platforms and regulators could change thanks to FTX, but that is “yet to be seen.” He said FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s close ties with regulators has been “detrimental to decentralized finance [DeFi] and the ideals of cryptocurrency.”Regulation could provide some runway for CEXs like Kraken, according to Ripley, but that will depend on a “thoughtful” approach in the future.Read more: ‘Never Let a Good Crisis Go to Waste’: CFTC Commissioner Calls on Congress to Act After FTX DebacleRipley said a number of federal regulators could play a role in creating better regulatory standards including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. However, he hinted that perhaps the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should be taking the lead.“The CFTC is a more natural regulator here, given that we’re not talking about securities” like bitcoin and ether, Ripley said.",2022/11/23
307,"Bitcoin held its $16,000 ground as traders anticipated the expected release at 2 p.m. ET (19:00 UTC) of minutes from the Federal Reserve's last monetary-policy meeting.The minutes might hold clues on the pace of future interest rates, a key factor in prices for risky assets from stocks to cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin (BTC) was trading as high as $16,634 early Wednesday but had settled back to $16,300 as of press time, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recovered somewhat since hitting a two-year low of $15,480 on Monday amid jitters over the future of the crypto financial firm Genesis.“The situation with Genesis itself is likely to have been priced in already,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital. “However, we will want to see if other names come to the fore as well.” (Genesis is a CoinDesk sister company.)Ether (ETH) followed a similar trend, up 2.5% to $1,160. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was up 1.4%. Some altcoins notched double-digit gains: Solana’s SOL token jumped 11%, while Binance's in-house BNB token was also up 11%. Zcash’s ZEC token was up 10%.Equities also edged up ahead of the Fed’s minutes, with the Standard and Poor's 500 index up 0.4%. U.S. weekly jobless claims reached a three-month high, which is reflected in the recent layoff wave in the tech sector. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) showed weakness, sliding 0.7%.There has been a debate in both traditional and digital-asset markets over how much the Fed will raise interest rates at its December meeting to curb hot inflation. The CME FedWatch tool currently shows that traders see roughly a 71% chance that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will raise rates by just 50 basis points (0.5 percentage point) in December – slowing from the 75 basis-point hikes at recent meetings.Any dovish signs from the Fed minutes may “help markets maintain these levels at the very least,” DiPasquale told CoinDesk.Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, wrote in a Wednesday note that bitcoin’s next area of resistance falls around $17,500, though it could be “very difficult to overcome.”“There's arguably a greater case for the price to fall to $10,000 at the moment than rising to $20,000,” Erlam wrote.",2022/11/23
308,"The long-awaited trial of Alexey Pertsev, held Tuesday in the Netherlands, offered a few clues to how prosecutors will take their case against the Tornado Cash developer forward – including detailing what he is being charged with doing.Pertsev, who contributed code to the crypto anonymizer, has been in jail since August, days after the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the decentralized protocol, which it said had been used to process dirty money by North Korean hackers.Tuesday’s pro forma hearing decided that Pertsev must remain detained until at least February – and also offered, for the first time, a clear statement of charges against the developer.But it also gave a hint about what the case will and won’t do. In the U.S., the Tornado Cash issue is often talked about in terms of the Constitution – which the U.S. Supreme Court has said includes the right to publish computer code.In Europe, there’s no equivalent legal doctrine. Lawyers in the case don’t seem to be making any appeal to the free speech provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, and it looks more like the trial will instead get deep into the mechanics of how decentralized finance (DeFi) works in practice.If so, the proceedings may do little to resolve more general questions – such as the fear many developers have that they could now be held responsible for the open-source software they develop.Here are some of the things we learned, beyond the initial headlines.Prosecutor Martine Boerlage mentioned Pertsev’s name frequently with co-developers Roman Semenov and Roman Storm as she attempted to paint a picture of a service that was under their joint control.“The defendant sits along with Semenov and Storm in the driver’s seat and determines what does or does not happen within Tornado Cash,” Boerlage said, citing evidence taken from group chats on Pertsev’s phone. (A written version of Boerlage’s speaking note seen by CoinDesk refers to the two as “S. and S.”)Separately, the prosecutor said that other suspects are also being investigated alongside Pertsev, but on a different track, given the complexity of pursuing those not on Dutch territory. Contacted by CoinDesk, the public prosecutor’s office declined to confirm whether Semenov and Storm are among those under investigation.When previously contacted by CoinDesk several weeks ago, Semenov told CoinDesk he was not ready to give public statements on the case, and did not immediately respond to a further request for information made after the trial. Storm invited CoinDesk to contact his lawyers, but did not say who they are.Dutch law makes it illegal to conceal or disguise the origin and movement of funds, and prosecutors said Tornado was used to place almost 75% of all crime-related crypto on the Ethereum blockchain.To prove that Pertsev is somehow responsible for this activity, prosecutors will have to refute the conventional wisdom that Tornado Cash runs autonomously, meaning it is not under anyone’s control.Boerlage said records of internal conversations show Pertsev, Semenov and Storm ran Tornado like a business, discussing management and operational decisions, and that they could, in practice, outvote other holders of the protocol’s TORN tokens. In particular, she said, they could have chosen to impose better laundering checks but doing so would have driven away too many clients.She said she’s still working to decipher exactly how Tornado’s governance works, and to prove that Pertsev profited from funds that passed through the protocol.“We have found large sums of money and cryptos in the name of the suspect in various places around the world,” Boerlage said. She added Pertsev “couldn’t have afforded his rented house and expensive Porsche” with wages from his job at cybersecurity company PepperSec alone.Pertsev’s lawyers deny the charges, which they say are vague and don’t specify when, why or how the supposed money laundering happened. They also said the prosecutor is confused about how decentralized finance works.Pertsev’s team will be seeking to show this case is different from existing case law on bitcoin mixers, the lawyers said. That will require a deep dive into how projects like Tornado Cash are governed, such as – for example – that the protocol can be used with multiple user interfaces, not just those supplied by Pertsev.“It's clear to us that these judges are not as familiar with the subject matter [of how crypto works] as they should be,” Pertsev’s lawyer Keith Cheng told CoinDesk outside the courtroom.Ultimately, the hearing was not substantive but procedural to decide whether Pertsev should remain in custody pending a full trial. As Cheng put it, the hearing is about “deprivation of pretty much the greatest asset we know in our society, which is our personal freedom.”Pertsev has been in jail since August without fully knowing the charges against him. His counsel alleges details and documents have been withheld.The hearing was a reminder of the great personal cost of being held, uncharged, in jail. Pertsev and his wife Xenia Malik have previously told CoinDesk they are permitted just a single, supervised, one-hour meeting per week. He was planning a trip to Disneyland with his kid sister when he was arrested, the court was told.In the courtroom, Malik wept as she observed the case being made against her husband. With judges deeming he could try to flee the country or hide evidence if freed, the couple now face a Christmas apart.Read more: Tornado Cash Developer's Arrest in the Netherlands Draws Community ProtestYou can read the prosecutor’s prepared remarks in Dutch here, and a Google Translated version here.Some quotes have been translated from Dutch.",2022/11/23
309,"A crypto wallet attributed to the BTC-e exchange that's been linked to the 2014 Mt. Gox hack burst into life Wednesday with its largest transaction since August 2017, sending a total of 10,000 bitcoin ($165 million) to two unidentified recipients.As part of the transaction, which took place around 08:38 UTC, a wallet that received 3,500 bitcoin forwarded 300 BTC to another destination. That was split further and landed in several wallets not attributed to any known custodial service. The distribution pattern is open to interpretation: It's possible the wallet owner simply sent the money to other wallets of their own, sent it to other people or cashed out through an unofficial over-the-counter broker. The remaining 6,500 stayed put.Mt. Gox, the first bitcoin exchange, was robbed of 744,408 BTC and shut permanently in 2014. Alexander Vinnik, alleged to be the operator of BTC-e – which he denies – was arrested in 2017 at a resort near Thessaloniki, Greece, at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice on money laundering and other allegations.The wallet involved in Wednesday's transaction was attributed to BTC-e by blockchain analytics system Crystal Blockchain. The transfer was noticed by Russian crypto entrepreneur Sergey Mendeleev, who published the observation in his Telegram channel. Blockchain data provides a limited amount of information, which is open to interpretation.Vinnik, a Russian national, faced competing extradition claims from Russia, France and the U.S. He was extradited to France from Greece in 2020 and sentenced to five years in prison for money laundering. In August of that year he was extradited to the U.S. to face allegations of “computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials and narcotics distribution rings,” according to a 2020 indictment by the California court. He is now at the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin, California, according to the court case docket.Soon after BTC-e closed and its servers seized by the FBI in 2017, a clone started under the name WEX. After a year of operation, WEX froze all withdrawals and shut down. CEO Dmitri Vasilev said he sold the exchange to Dmitri Khavchenko.Before and after shutting down, WEX wallets were drained of millions of dollars worth of crypto, CoinDesk reported at the time. Users filed police reports and several investigations were reportedly launched in Russia and Kazakhstan. Over the years, Vasilev has been arrested in Italy, Poland and Croatia at the request of the Russian police, but every time released soon after.The most recent picture in Vasilev's Instagram profile was posted on May 3, geotagged as taken in Amsterdam. On the photo, Vasilev is standing in front of a store named Scamm.In his public talks, as well as in group chats with WEX users, Vasilev said control of users' crypto had always been with the anonymous WEX admin. In 2019, another Russian national, Alexei Bilyuchenko, confessed to being the admin. He said he was forced to transfer all the money to two unidentified officers of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), according to the criminal case materials obtained by BBC.According to a group of WEX users, Bilyuchenko is currently in a Russian prison called Matrosskaya Tishina in Moscow, because a letter sent to him through the official prison mail system was reported as received.",2022/11/23
310,"Two U.S. senators are demanding the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigate the “disturbing allegations of fraud and illicit behavior that led to the collapse of [FTX]”  and hold the company’s executives “to the fullest extent of the law.”In the letter on Wednesday, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) reminded Attorney General Merrick Garland and Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite of the DOJ’s recently renewed commitment to prosecuting white-collar criminals. The senators want them to honor that commitment when investigating the behavior of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and other executives “with the utmost scrutiny.”Warren, a long-time critic of the crypto industry, has closely monitored the collapse of the Bahamas-based FTX, as well as the ripple effects that collapse has had across the wider industry.On Tuesday, Warren, Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) sent a letter to Fidelity, asking the financial services firm to reconsider allowing retail clients to include bitcoin in their retirement plans. Last week, Warren and Durbin wrote to Bankman-Fried and FTX’s current CEO, John Jay Ray III, asking for information about what precipitated the exchange’s collapse.In addition to the knock-on effect across the wider crypto industry, Warren and Whitehouse’s letter expresses concerns about the impact of FTX’s implosion on retail investors, who they say were given a “false sense of safety and legitimacy” by FTX’s “high-dollar advertisement placements and celebrity endorsements.”Though the letter urges the DOJ to investigate and prosecute all FTX executives potentially embroiled in the alleged fraud, Bankman-Fried bears the brunt of Warren and Whitehouse’s ire.“The fall of FTX was not simply a result of sloppy business and management practices, but rather appears to have been caused by intentional and fraudulent tactics employed by Mr. Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives to enrich themselves,” the senators wrote. “In fact, Mr. Bankman-Fried had already revealed his true interests of self-enrichment last year when he siphoned $300 million to his own wallet.”Read more: The FTX Downfall: Full Coverage",2022/11/23

The bill seeks to establish a National Digital Assets Commission that would oversee the regulation of digital asset issuers, service providers and other participants involved in the ""public offering process"" of digital securities according to the 33-page document reviewed by CoinDesk.In 2021, under the leadership of President Nayib Bukele, the Central American nation became the first in the world to make the popular cryptocurrency bitcoin legal tender.

The cryptocurrency's outperformance perhaps stems from an impending positive change in its supply dynamics.CoinDesk data shows LTC has rallied over 43% from $55 to $79 this month, with prices rising 28% in the past 24 hours alone. Market leaders bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) have dropped 19% and 26% this month.LTC's bullish turn comes eight months ahead of Litecoin's third mining reward halving – a programmed code that will reduce rewards or LTC paid to miners for recording transactions on Litecoin's blockchain from 12.5 LTC per block to 6.25 LTC per block.To crypto natives, LTC's latest rally may be reminiscent of the bearish-to-bullish trend change seen in the months leading up to the previous halvings, dated Aug. 26, 2015, and Aug. 5, 2019.LTC bottomed out, broke out of prolonged downtrends and led bitcoin higher in the run-up to the 2015 and 2019 halvings.

Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin regained its grip over $16K after dipping to a two-year low earlier in the week.Insights: Changpeng Zhao and Elon Musk have been pointed in recent comments about FTX and the rapidly growing fallout. Did they go too far?Bitcoin Recovered From Its Monday SlumberBy James RubinBitcoin awakened from an early-week slumber to rest snugly above its previous $16,000 support.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading about $16,200, up 2.5% as crypto markets returned to tracking stocks, which rose on renewed hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy was taming inflation and that it would soon be able to retrench from its recent diet of 75 basis point interest rate hikes.""Wall Street is mostly green today and that has provided a little boost for cryptos,"" wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda.BTC sunk to a two-year low on Monday amid fears over the fate of Genesis Global, a once-mighty crypto trading and lending firm, that is reportedly in talks to raise fresh capital after it halted customer withdrawals last week. Genesis is the latest victim of the fallout from the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange, and despite Tuesday's bitcoin recovery, investors remained jittery. (Genesis is a CoinDesk sister company.)""Bitcoin is back above the $16,000 level but still remains in the danger zone as everyone waits for the next crypto domino to fall,"" Moya wrote. ""It seems crypto traders are already pricing in a bankruptcy for crypto lender Genesis. Contagion for FTX will impact many but it seems a fresh catalyst is needed for sellers to take control.""Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,120, up more than 2%.

The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, was roughly flat.The tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) each jumped over a percentage point after Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said the Fed was entering ""a restrictive stance of policy.""At that point, I think it makes sense that we can slow down a bit the ... pace of increases,” she said. “We’re still going to raise the funds rate, but we’re at a reasonable point now where we can be very deliberate in setting monetary policy.”Meanwhile, in crypto news, a well-known crypto trader linked to last month’s $114 million Mango Markets exploit failed in his attempt to find a similar vulnerability. The trader, identified on Twitter and tagged by blockchain analysts as Avraham Eisenberg, borrowed 40 million curve (CRV) tokens (worth $20 million at the time) using the decentralized lending platform Aave, then transferred them to the OKEx crypto exchange.But after a series of wild swings in the CRV price, Eisenberg's position appears to have been liquidated. According to the blockchain analysis firm Arkham, Eisenberg borrowed the majority of CRV tokens on Aave by pledging $40 million in USDC stablecoin as collateral. Blockchain sleuths on Twitter speculated that he appeared to be building up a CRV short position – that is, to profit off a price decline.Oanda's Moya was less than sanguine about crypto pricing in the weeks ahead. ""Bitcoin has support ahead of the $15,500 level but if that does not hold, technical selling could send prices toward the $13,500 region,"" he wrote. ​Did Changpeng Zhao and Elon Go Too Far?By James RubinWhat do billionaires and multimillionaires say about crypto?Anything they want.On Tuesday crypto exchange Binance founder and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao add his voice to the chorus of crypto observers doubting that Grayscale, operator of the largest bitcoin trust, holds as much BTC as it says. But he then made a quick retreat.Zhao initially tweeted numbers that, had they been true, would have undermined a position held by Grayscale and its partner, crypto exchange Coinbase, that such concerns were unwarranted. But he deleted his tweet after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong appeared to respond soon after on Twitter.""If you see FUD out there – remember, our financials are public (we're a public company),"" Armstrong wrote, referring to crypto parlance for fear, uncertainty and doubt. (Binance is a privately held company that doesn't disclose financial information.)Zhao appeared contrite: ""Brian Armstrong just told me"" the numbers ""are wrong,"" he wrote, adding: ""Let’s work together to improve transparency in the industry."" (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)The Twitter interaction between CZ and Armstrong preceded a story by Semafor, a recent publication founded by Bloomberg and New York Times veterans, that Elon Musk wasn't always as down on the disgraced founder of troubled crypto exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, as he's been in recent comments.On Nov. 12, a day after FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Musk said in a Twitter Spaces event: “To be honest, I’d never heard of him,” Musk said. “But then I got a ton of people telling me [that] he’s got, you know, huge amounts of money that he wants to invest in the Twitter deal. And I talked to him for about half an hour. And I know my bulls**t meter was redlining. It was like, this dude is bulls**t – that was my impression.”But shortly after announcing his $44 billion purchase of social media platform Twitter, Musk had invited Bankman-Fried to sink a $100 million stake he owned in the previously publicly traded company. And as Semafor reported, the two even had a phone call in late spring weeks before the deal closed about Bankman-Fried possibly joining a bid for Twitter. Bankman-Fried elected not to participate but contributed his $100 million in stock toward a now privately held company.

320,"Foresight Ventures (FV), a crypto fund with $400 million in assets under management (AUM), is launching an incubator program called Foresight X. The program will allocate $10 million to three different types of Web3 funding and collaborations.Two programs have unlimited pools of ecosystem and research grants. The third is an eight-week incubator program for 30 early-stage projects or startups, which includes up to $300,000 in funding. Gitcoin, a crowdfunding platform, will share incentives and partner with FV to build collaborations and mentorships.“We are particularly interested in projects that offer solutions to help scale [the crypto] industry for mainstream adoption,” Tony Cheng, general partner at Foresight Ventures, said in a press release. The grant application process is scheduled to open at the end of this year.Prior to the recent downfall of FTX, which is still sending shockwaves throughout the crypto industry, Web3 funding in general had been dropping. There was around $3.3 billion in startup funding in the third quarter of this year, a nearly 50% drop compared with the second quarter, according to Crunchbase data. In 2021, almost $9.3 billion was invested in the final quarter of the year.Despite the latest tsunami of sobering crypto news and trends, Foresight Ventures considers the period an opportunity to build. “We understand very well that bear markets are periods of massive innovation and growth,” co-founder Forest Bai said in the press release. The program will prioritize projects at every stage of development, “to accelerate” the crypto industry’s evolution.Established in 2020, Foresight Ventures has invested in Web3, non-fungible token, gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Last year, AUM increased to $400 million from $80 million following FV's acquisition of Singapore-based exchange and trading platform, BitGet, and its limited partnership with BitKeep, a multi-chain digital wallet in Asia.FV launched its first incubation program during CoinDesk’s Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas.

321,"Gray Wang is not like his co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who loves fame and putting himself at the center of public attention (even when people are begging him to stop tweeting). In fact, there’s little public information about Wang, who has been described as a shady but critical player in the rise and fall of FTX.Wang met Bankman-Fried at a math camp in high school. Later, they became college roommates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Wang got degrees in mathematics and computer science and Bankman-Fried received a bachelor's in physics.See also: Who's Who in the FTX Inner CircleBefore co-founding Alameda Research (and later FTX), Wang worked at Google. He claims to have built a system to aggregate prices across public flight data, according to an introduction on the Future Fund's website. When Bankman-Fried left the Jane Street Hedge Fund to start Alameda in 2017, Wang left the tech giant.The startup has its beginnings in a three-bedroom Berkeley apartment – the downstairs served as its office. The firm shifted to Hong Kong, in part to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities in Asian bitcoin markets – including the price discrepancy between BTC in Japan and BTC everywhere else.It’s there that Wang and Bankman-Fried funneled funds from Alameda to build its bespoke derivatives exchange. Bankman-Fried told Insider that he is not a good coder: ""I don't code. I'm trash. I have not written any of FTX's code base. That's all a lot of other really impressive people at FTX. That's not me at all.""Nishad Singh, the head of engineering at FTX, said Wang was a ""really good mentor"" who offered suggestions and advice to push things out on short timescales.In the aftermath of FTX’s collapse, and the subsequent $400 million hack, questions are circulating around who could possibly have abused client funds. Wang is a prominent suspect, as one of the few people with ""root access"" to the exchange’s code base, according to The Block.Wang is also one of the board members of FTX Future Fund – the charity guided by “effective altruism” that aims to ""use reason and evidence to do the most good possible for the most people.""Wang, one of the 10 roommates in Bankman-Fried’ luxury penthouse in the Bahamas, is reportedly among the four people cited by Caroline Ellison who knew about the decision to send customer funds to Alameda, according to people who spoke to the Wall Street Journal.A few Wang photos are circulating on the internet, though little else is known about the mysterious co-founder who preferred to stay in the shadows as SBF chased the limelight. In a now infamous picture on FTX’s website, CTO Wang is seen with his back facing the camera as he focuses on the monitors in front of him.At the age of 28, Wang topped Forbes' 2022 list of the world's billionaires under 30 with a net worth of $5.9 billion in April.

322,"As the world picks through the wreckage of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda Research, scrutiny has fallen largely on founder Sam Bankman-Fried and his close circle of allies. But one hugely important figure in the immense financial catastrophe was never a part of Bankman-Fried’s corporate leadership circle: the 35-year-old Scottish philosopher William MacAskill.Instead, MacAskill is the thinker perhaps most associated with the moral philosophy known as “effective altruism,” which was profoundly influential on Bankman-Fried, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and others in their intimate circle. MacAskill is currently an associate professor in philosophy and a research fellow at the Global Priorities Institute at England’s University of Oxford. He is the author of several books, including a 2016 introduction to effective altruism called “Doing Good Better” and a recent follow up called “What We Owe the Future.”See also: Who's Who in the FTX Inner CircleThose books, and MacAskill’s broader body of work, may be due for a reassessment after the FTX debacle. Some have argued that MacAskill’s ethical views helped nudge Bankman-Fried to take the risks that ultimately led to the implosion of the Alameda/FTX empire. And according to people, including one of Bankman-Fried’s most prominent financial backers, MacAskill wasn’t just a philosophical influencer: He played a direct role in guiding Bankman-Fried along the path that led to the creation, and ultimately implosion, of Alameda Research and the FTX exchange.After Bankman-Fried established the philanthropic Future Fund, MacAskill became an adviser, helping distribute funds for maximum impact. After the collapse of Alameda and FTX, MacAskill announced that he had resigned, saying the role had been unpaid. Staff of the Future Fund have also resigned, announcing that many grants already promised to organizations will now go unfulfilled because of the blowup.Read more: How Sam Bankman-Fried’s ‘Effective’ Altruism Blew Up FTXWhile many moral systems maintain that human suffering could be best alleviated by spreading both wealth and power more democratically, effective altruism essentially argues the opposite: that the very smartest and hardest-working individuals should pursue wealth and influence, then leverage it to the greater good. Many if not most members of Bankman-Fried’s inner circle professed effective altruist beliefs. According to a recent profile of MacAskill in the New Yorker, effective altruists worldwide now control roughly $30 billion in philanthropic funds.According to a fawning profile of Bankman-Fried published by Sequoia Capital, MacAskill had a direct and sizable influence on the founder’s worldview from very early on. (Sequoia has long been one of the most respected venture capital funds in Silicon Valley, and invested a reported $210 million in FTX. It has since written the investment down to zero – and deleted the profile of Bankman-Fried from its website.)MacAskill, according to the Sequoia profile, was introduced to SBF through MIT’s Epsilon Theta, the “coed fraternity of supergeeks” through which many future members of the FTX leadership circle first connected. That led to a coffee meeting in which MacAskill pitched effective altruism to Bankman-Fried, years before SBF founded the crypto exchange.During that initial meeting, MacAskill reportedly urged Bankman-Fried to adopt an “earn to give” approach to life. That mindset could be easily mistaken for a moral license to bend the rules, especially by someone who, like Sam Bankman-Fried, “would never read a book.”But MacAskill’s influence was not merely to give Bankman-Fried an all-too-wobbly ethical framework. Also according to the Sequoia profile, it was MacAskill who suggested Bankman-Fried pursue an internship at the trading firm Jane Street, rather than more directly public-spirited options Bankman-Fried was considering, such as becoming a journalist or entering politics directly. Jane Street became a stepping stone that led directly to the creation, and ultimately downfall, of Alameda Research and FTX.The global effective altruism community even reportedly played a direct role in the “kimchi premium” trade that is believed to have generated the capital for the creation of FTX. Again according to the Sequoia profile, a Japanese effective altruist helped Bankman-Fried set up the Japanese banking needed to arbitrage the premium on the price of bitcoin in South Korea.Bankman-Fried’s behavior, which increasingly appears to have included not just mismanagement but substantial fraud, has triggered a wave of vexed soul-searching in the effective altruism community. But critics of MacAskill’s ideas have for years insisted they founder on basic questions, such as: Who determines the right people to (altruistically) pursue wealth and influence? The answer would seem to be a hyper-capitalist tautology: The people who make the most money are inherently the most deserving, because they’re the smartest and therefore also know the best ways to improve the world.An implicit version of this type of “altruism” was arguably baked into the “change the world” narratives that for a time fueled excitement around tech companies like Facebook (now Meta). That isn't a surprise: This philosophical frame is an ideal way to make boatloads of money doing things like selling user data without having to feel bad about it, as long as you give a lot of the money away. In practice, that’s not so different from the charitable efforts of old-school robber barons like John D. Rockefeller.To his credit, MacAskill wrote in the aftermath of the collapse that “if those involved deceived others and engaged in fraud … they entirely abandoned the principles of the effective altruism community.” He also seems to have taken his principles more seriously than many of his adherents. According to the New Yorker profile, in his youth MacAskill cut his own expenses to the bone so he could donate money to help people in need, to the point of relying on homemade bread for his dinners.But that more onerous side of the effective altruism seems fairly flexible for some, including Bankman-Fried: a luxury penthouse in the Bahamas shared with 10 friends is, after all, still a luxury penthouse in the Bahamas.",2022/11/22
323,"The downfall of FTX was swift and brutal. In a matter of eight days earlier this month, the crypto exchange – developed as a skunk-work project inside Sam Bankman-Fried’s quant-driven trading shop, Alameda Research – went from being one of the most used and valuable crypto companies ever to a pile of failed bets and worthless tokens.How exactly the firm collapsed is still a matter of investigation. Three U.S. federal agencies – the Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity and Futures Trading Commission – are probing the remains while insiders begin to speak out about a company that rose and fell like a house of cards.FTX’s new chief executive, John Ray III, has said Bankman-Fried’s crypto trading empire is the biggest “failure of corporate controls” he’s seen – a notable statement considering Ray helped unravel the Enron scandal and to get its investors paid. Upwards of one million FTX customers have lost funds, according to bankruptcy filings.While not conclusively proven, it seems that FTX client money was being gambled by Alameda traders. That could have been standard operating procedure for years between the two closely linked firms, or part of a poorly planned scheme to patch holes in the hedge fund’s balance sheet that emerged in the market downturn earlier this year.And that’s just it: As the story continues to develop, the world is none the wiser about the motivations behind crypto’s most significant collapse since Mt. Gox. Is Sam Bankman-Fried, the disheveled, media-hungry founder, a sociopath, as some are beginning to say? Or a product of a worldview called effective altruism, which might encourage people to lie, cheat or steal their way to a fortune – so long as it’s for a good cause?There were red flags along the way. Brian Armstrong, surveying the wreckage, has said he was always curious about Bankman-Fried’s burn rate, considering the relative size of FTX and Armstrong’s own crypto exchange, Coinbase. Then there’s the warning signs in FTX’s accounting – including signs of tax avoidance and misappropriation (to say nothing of Prager Metis, FTX’s sketchy auditing firm with an office in Decentraland).See also: What Investors and Accountants Missed in FTX's AuditsWhat about the fact that FTX’s C-Suite was composed of mostly inexperienced friends of Bankman-Fried? CoinDesk, which kick-started the FTX fall with a terse story about Alameda’s illiquid assets, has since reported that FTX was primarily controlled by an inner-circle of close associates. Not much is known about the group – made worse as members take steps to delete their social media accounts.By and large, SBF’s inner circle were all adherents of effective altruism. They lived closely together, in Bahamian property owned by FTX and Bankman-Fried, and formed romantic relationships. Some may have been clued in about a so-called backdoor between FTX and Alameda, which allowed client funds to be transferred without leaving a trace.CoinDesk has gathered what information is available about these individuals, which includes childhood friends of Bankman-Fried and recent hires. Not everyone listed will be implicated in what looks like fraud, but as high-level operators they should do what they can to make sure the full story is told.The former CEO of Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison, has spent her entire professional career as a trader. While a junior studying math at Stanford University, Ellison took her first of two internships with Jane Street, a Wall Street hedge fund known for its heavy use of algorithms, where she excelled. She put off a one-year master’s degree program to join the firm full time.“Trading is the biggest thing that allowed me to excel in trading,” Ellison said in an interview for Alameda’s podcast in 2021. For anyone else, the statement would be a tautology, but for the bookish Ellison, who came into crypto as a skeptic, it was never obvious that she’d lead one of the most influential digital asset hedge funds.After a year and a half on Jane Street’s equities desk, Ellison made a “lateral” move to Alameda, after meeting her former Jane Street colleague Sam Bankman-Fried for coffee in the Bay area. She has said Bankman-Fried was initially cagey about what Alameda did. She came aboard with “more experience than a lot of Alameda traders at the time,” she said.See also: Who Is Alameda Research's Caroline Ellison?Alameda, at its founding, was a market maker for low-liquidity altcoins. It took a market-neutral approach to the industry, but eventually began taking a more participatory role in crypto and increasingly bullish or bearish leveraged bets on specific coins. This includes yield farming on decentralized finance protocols, she said. She had never used the Ethereum wallet MetaMask before DeFi Summer.While the details are yet unknown, it seems like the cracks in Bankman-Fried’s crypto trading empire appeared first at Alameda following the collapse of the LUNA coin bubble. In a May 25 podcast with Spanish-language El Momento, Ellison now infamously said many of her trades relied on “elementary school math” and gut.In October 2021, Ellison was appointed as co-CEO of Alameda with Sam Trabucco after Bankman-Fried resigned from the firm in an effort to put distance between the exchange and trading shop he founded. She has described her role as “broad.” Ellison became sole CEO in August, following Trabucco’s departure from the firm.Like many within the FTX-Alameda orbit, Ellison was an “effective altruist,” or someone who tries to maximize the good they can do by making money and spending it based on supposedly rational calculations. Ellison is thought to be the person behind a blog called “World Optimization,” which covered topics popular in the California Rationalist community including polyamory and race science, Futurism reported.Until this week, Ellison lived with nine other FTX or Alameda colleagues in Bankman-Fried’s $30 million penthouse in the Bahamas. She reportedly paid SBF rent, and was occasionally in a romantic relationship with him. In 2021, Ellison tweeted about recreational stimulant use.“Young people tend to be too risk averse,” Ellison said in a more recent Alameda podcast episode.The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Ellison told Alameda staffers in a video call that she was one of four people aware of the decision to send FTX customer funds to Alameda, to help the fund meet its liabilities. In early November, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported that Alameda was structurally insolvent as much of the money it had on hand was illiquid altcoins, particularly FTX’s exchange token, FTT.See also: More Than 50% of Bitcoin Addresses Are Now in LossEllison has been a fan of the Harry Potter series since childhood, and has written LARPs (live action role playing games) in her free time. She was reportedly working on writing a novel.Adding to the intrigue: Ellison’s father, Glenn Ellison, is the Gregory K. Palm Professor of Economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is the head of the economics department and was in this role when current Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler famously taught an MIT course on blockchain. Her mother, Sara Fischer Ellison, is also an economics department lecturer at the university.Nishad Singh joined Alameda Research in the early days, when the five-person trading firm was based in a Berkeley, California, apartment. He went from finding and exploiting arbitrage opportunities in crypto markets to being appointed director of engineering at FTX.Singh is thought to be a close confidant of Bankman-Fried, having shared multiple apartments with the FTX founder over the years, including most recently a 10-person luxury penthouse in Nassau, the Bahamas.He is rumored to be just one of three people who controlled the keys to the exchange’s matching engine, and may have been informed of a plan to backstop losses at Alameda with FTX customer funds.Singh did not return a request for comment for this article. Although his LinkedIn profile is down and his Twitter account locked, the University of California, Berkeley graduate talked about why he left his dream job at Facebook to join Alameda Research in a FTX podcast.""I spent maybe about a month doing weekends and nights at Alameda,” he said, discussing a period of time when his “day job” was as a software engineer working on applied machine learning at Facebook. “At some point, it became obvious that was kind of stupid … so I took some time off and really gave my 100% working at Alameda,"" Singh said.Singh visited Alameda in the first month of its existence, where he witnessed Bankman-Fried execute a sequence of trades that he described as ""super profitable, easy to understand and there were lots available."" Feeling inspired, he took a job.In the podcast, Singh said he was also attracted to the company's cultural commitment to effective altruism, a movement that ""aims to find the best ways to help others,"" which he discovered in college. He is a board member of FTX Future Fund, a part of the FTX Foundation, a philanthropic collective funded principally by Bankman-Fried and other senior FTX executives.""It was pretty clear that everybody working [at Alameda] was highly motivated, was sort of effective altruism-aligned, which mattered a lot to me and was really [a] bright spot. I could learn a lot from them,"" Singh said in the podcast.After spending one and a half years as a core Alameda engineer, Singh took a role as the head of engineering at the then-newly launched FTX derivative exchange in 2019, where he was allowed to code with “minimal supervision.” He has provided code to a number of Bankman-Fried-related projects, including the decentralized exchange Serum on Solana.“Nishad was one of my brother’s best friends in high school. He’s shown the fastest and most sustained professional growth I’ve ever witnessed,” Bankman-Fried wrote in a company blog. Singh also reportedly built most of FTX’s “technological infrastructure” and managed the development team.Although pitched as a community-run and- organized exchange, people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk the true power over Serum rested with FTX Group, which then held the program’s access keys. A similar relationship may be in place at FTX’s core properties.Singh is reportedly now ""under supervision"" by Bahamian authorities along with Bankman-Fried and Wang.When Sam Trabucco stepped down as co-CEO of trading firm Alameda Research in August, he tweeted, ""But if I've learned anything at Alameda, it's how to make good decisions – and this is the right one for me.""In hindsight, it seems like impeccable timing for Trabucco to quit a high-stress job to spend time on his newly purchased boat – mere months before the company would go under water.It only took 10 days for Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire to go from processing withdrawals, albeit slowly, to declaring bankruptcy. This followed a CoinDesk report in November showing that, for all intents and purposes, Alameda Research, which had $8 billion of liabilities and $14.6 billion in assets, was insolvent.See also: Who Is Alameda's Former co-CEO Sam Trabucco?The hedge fund Trabucco ran likely came to own many of its illiquid altcoins during his tenure. This includes the inexplicably large amount of FTT, the exchange token for Alameda’s sister company, FTX.Trabucco joined Alameda as a trader in 2019 after a stint as a quant trader on Susquehanna International Group’s bond desk. He was appointed co-CEO in October 2021 with Caroline Ellison, after his friend-cum-boss Bankman-Fried resigned in an attempt to distance the SBF-owned trading firm from the SBF-controlled trading platform.“He is not really involved in day-to-day operations in Alameda. Caroline and I have been leading the charge there for quite some time,” Trabucco told CoinDesk at the time.Trabucco met Bankman-Fried during a five week math camp at Mount Holyoke College in 2010, according to Insider. He recalled that Bankman-Fried barely slept during their stay. The two reunited at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Trabucco received his bachelor’s degrees in math and computer science.As co-CEO, Trabucco helped oversee Alameda’s expansion beyond its initial market-neutral, but relatively low-profit business as a market maker for low-volume cryptocurrencies into riskier trading strategies, according to a Twitter thread detailing that shift. For instance, he said Alameda traders began exploring yield farming in decentralized finance (DeFi).Eventually, according to Trabucco’s account, the trading firm began taking in “huge” profits placing highly leveraged bets on assets like dogecoin after noticing its price went up whenever Elon Musk tweeted about the meme coin.Although the full story is not yet known, emerging evidence suggests Alameda suffered a series of losses during the beginning of the crypto market downturn. Ellison did not include Trabucco among a list of named persons who knew about the decision to send customer funds to Alameda, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.In August, Trabucco announced his resignation and became an adviser of the company. On Nov. 8, when FTX agreed to sell itself to Binance, Trabucco tweeted, ""Much love to everyone,"" and that he ""hope[d] the road ahead is brighter.""Trabucco did not return a request for comment for this article.Gary Wang is not like his co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who loves fame and putting himself at the center of public attention (even when people are begging him to stop tweeting).

The answer would seem to be a hyper-capitalist tautology: The people who make the most money are inherently the most deserving, because they’re the smartest and therefore also know the best ways to improve the world.An implicit version of this type of “altruism” was arguably baked into the “change the world” narratives that for a time fueled excitement around tech companies like Facebook (now Meta). That isn't a surprise: This philosophical frame is an ideal way to make boatloads of money doing things like selling user data without having to feel bad about it, as long as you give a lot of the money away. In practice, that’s not so different from the charitable efforts of old-school robber barons like John D. Rockefeller.To his credit, MacAskill wrote in the aftermath of the collapse that “if those involved deceived others and engaged in fraud … they entirely abandoned the principles of the effective altruism community.” He also seems to have taken his principles more seriously than many of his adherents. According to the New Yorker profile, in his youth MacAskill cut his own expenses to the bone so he could donate money to help people in need, to the point of relying on homemade bread for his dinners.But that more onerous side of the effective altruism seems fairly flexible for some, including Bankman-Fried: a luxury penthouse in the Bahamas shared with 10 friends is, after all, still a luxury penthouse in the Bahamas.Ramnik Arora was one of FTX’s most high-profile hires in a period of rapid expansion before the crypto exchange’s quick unraveling in November. The head of product, sometimes called Sam Bankman-Fried’s “key lieutenant,” was “plucked out of obscurity from Meta Platforms in 2020, according to tech news site The Information.In addition to overseeing the rollout of new products at the exchange, Arora was key to FTX’s investor relations. He reportedly served as a conduit to the venture capital giant Sequoia Capital, which invested in FTX’s Series B funding round and advocated for Bankman-Fried. The firm was valued at $32 billion, before it unraveled.The Information, citing internal sources, also said Arora played a large role on the opposite side of investor relations at FTX, and helped close a number of venture deals Bankman-Fried and his exchange made into crypto startups. He was a general partner at FTX Ventures, where he helped close rounds with Aptos, LayerZero and Coral.In a now-notable scene from Bankman-Fried’s fundraising salad days, Arora said he had caught the CEO playing a video game while giving a “well-received presentation.”“The entire partner meeting, he was playing League of Legends at the same time,” Arora told The New York Times in April.Arora has a master’s degree in mathematics and computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology, New York University and Stanford. Before joining Facebook (since renamed Meta), he held various roles at IV Capital and Goldman Sachs.He founded his own venture fund called Toy Ventures, initially seeded with his own and his friends' capital, he said in an interview with Encode Club, a Web3 education channel. He said this business was built up gradually in an “ad hoc” fashion.In that same interview, Arora said he thought of FTX as an exchange built for “crypto natives” and that part of his mandate was making it a friendly on-ramp for retail investors. This included “obfuscating” the things that make crypto hard, by improving its UX (user experience) and interface.“Any friction in the process will have a huge drop-off,” he said, adding that he often listened to Crypto Twitter to get a sense of the products in which people would be interested, such as future non-fungible token (NFT) integrations. Compared with his time at Facebook, Arora said the speed of FTX’s product development was its “superpower,” he said.“We can move on a dime,” Arora said, adding later that its “blockers” were “regulatory,” like figuring out the frameworks and licenses he would need to apply for to launch new services.Arora is known for his intense work ethic, which may explain his close relationship with Bankman-Fried, who was known to have slept only five hours a day – often on a bean bag chair near his office desk. In the Encore interview, Arora talks about working 20-hour days and said he has decided with his wife that work should take precedence in their lives for the time being.“It is not a balanced work-life balance,” he said.Daniel S. Friedberg was the chief compliance officer at FTX, the person who oversaw the then-second-largest cryptocurrency exchange’s compliance initiatives before it imploded. He joined the firm in March 2020.Friedberg has also been tied to an online poker scandal in 2008, where Ultimate Bet’s founder Russ Hamilton was accused of installing a “God mode” on his gambling platform that only certain players had access to – resulting in an estimated $50 million in misappropriated funds.In a surreptitiously recorded file, Friedberg reportedly advised Hamilton to claim he was a victim of the Ultimate Bets ""God mode"" scam, and push blame on an unnamed consultant to the company who exploited the site’s servers. The audio recordings were published in 2013 under uncertain circumstances and have not been independently verified by CoinDesk.“I did take this money and I’m not trying to make it right, Dan, so we gotta get that out of the way right away, real quick,” Hamilton allegedly said in the audio recording. Hamilton also founded the World Champion online poker platform.Veteran short seller Marc Cohodes, one of the few to publicly question the rapid rise of FTX before its fall in a September interview with trading-focused webcast Hedgeye, had noted the potential conflicts of hiring someone connected to a cheating scandal to oversee compliance at the $32 billion FTX exchange.See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Switches Legal Counsel In August, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) sent a letter to Friedberg and then-FTX US CEO Brett Harrison to “cease and desist” using marketing language that could have been erroneously interpreted as saying that exchange users accounts were ensured by the federal banking regulator.Before joining FTX, Friedberg was a partner at Fenwick & West LLP, where he led the law firm’s cryptocurrency division, according to a now-deprecated LinkedIn page. He received a JD and MBA degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.At press time, Ryan Salame is one of the few upper-level FTX executives who has not made attempts to delete his internet history. His Twitter and Linkedin accounts are still accessible, for instance, though they have yet to be updated to reflect he has left the firm.Salame, a 2015 graduate from the University of Massachusetts–Amherst, was co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, the Bahamas-based holding company for much of the crypto exchange’s global footprint. He also held a CPA license in Massachusetts that expired in 2018. He earned a master’s degree in finance from Georgetown University.According to people speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Salame allegedly vomited after learning of the depths of deception at FTX, including how the firm’s inner circle misused and lost client funds. He told the WSJ he is not part of that inner circle.Salame joined FTX in 2019 from the stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial, and before that served as a senior tax accountant at Ernst & Young (EY). On his LinkedIn page he claims to have assisted Bankman-Fried incorporate the recently built exchange as FTX Trading Ltd.Before being appointed co-CEO of FDM, Salame had spent two years as Alameda Research’s head of OTC [over-the-counter] for the Asia-Pacific region, while based in Hong Kong.Salame also apparently has ownership in a number of restaurants through a partnership with Lenox Eats. Among those is “a food truck with a flexible ‘pop up’ style menu” called Lunch Pail, which was expected to open in 2022.Just as Bankman-Fried has become known for his political donations, Salame was also a mega-donor. He had donated $20,367,000 to Republican candidates in 2022, according to OpenSecrets. That makes him the 15th largest donor overall for this past U.S. election cycle.In the days since FTX exploded, Constance Wang has come under fire for her seeming lack of experience. Indeed, the National University of Singapore graduate – class of 2015 – has a fairly short resume: a Singapore-based Credit Suisse analyst turned business development lead at Huobi who caught the express train to wealth by joining FTX in 2019.“Constance Wang, the COO of FTX, is an ex-Credit Suisse analyst with [two] years of experience in risk management. It was her first job out of university,” venture capitalist Ana Mostarac tweeted.As chief operating officer, Wang said she was “primarily responsible for global user growth, partnerships, [public relations and] marketing, institutional clients servicing, and global expansion operations,” as written on her LinkedIn.In January, 2022, Wang was appointed co-chief executive officer of FTX Digital Markets, the Bahamian licensing structure that held much of FTX’s businesses.According to CoinDesk, Wang had lived in Sam Bankman-Fried’s 10-person crash pad in the Bahamas. She has since resigned from the company.Jen Chan was the chief financial officer of FTX – and perhaps the only direct report to Sam Bankman-Fried who had any direct work experience in the area of the business she oversaw.Between 2003 and 2006, Chan was an assistant manager at KPMG, the auditing firm. She then had a multi-year stint at Blackstone, serving at a director level for its investing and accounting business.Immediately before joining FTX, Chan was head of investment management company Alter Domus’ Hong Kong office, and had also spent time as an accountant in a division of Deutsche Bank called RREEF.A native of Hong Kong, she attended the city-state’s prestigious Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. She joined Bankman-Fried’s empire in October 2018 as director of Cottonwood Grove Limited, a Hong Kong-based subsidiary of Alameda Research, which was then registered in the British Virgin Islands.According to the Financial Times, Chan owned 100% of Salameda Ltd, a Hong Kong-based entity of FTX that looked like “a group outrider with links to Alameda entities by service agreements.”",2022/11/22

325,"The spectacular $32 billion collapse of the FTX exchange and its sister trading firm Alameda Research recently once again has crypto’s detractors gloating in the headlines. In fact, FTX bears no resemblance to most of what the longtime believers in blockchains and Web3 are trying to build.The failure of FTX was not one of insufficient regulation nor of a corrupted codebase, but a human failure. Rather than condemning crypto, FTX demonstrates that truly decentralized, transparent and open Web3 technologies can better protect users and support a more fair and more resilient digital financial system. Here’s why.Illia Polosukhin is a co-founder of Near Protocol and Unchain Fund.There was nothing decentralized or transparent about Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire. In reality, FTX bears a lot more resemblance to the overleveraged institutions that failed in 2008 than it does to what most of the blockchain industry is building. The reason is simple: It is centralized and therefore restrictive in participation, owned by few, governed by even fewer. The platform controls the order books and users’ funds, holding reserves within its own vaults.Bitcoin, the first blockchain, allows peer-to-peer value transfer between two parties anywhere in the world, without the need for an intermediary like a corporation or a bank. Ethereum introduced programmable smart contracts to this paradigm, allowing entire applications to run on this global, distributed network.Now there are many such programmable blockchains that form the backbone of Web3, the movement to decentralize internet infrastructure using blockchain-based technologies. These open blockchain networks run on transparent, open ledgers where transaction records are verifiable by anyone in the network and therefore very difficult to censor. The benefit of decentralized systems is that they are transparent, so stakeholders know what is happening; censorship resistant, so it’s difficult for bad actors to exploit or take over; and antifragile, so they can adapt in response to challenges.Centralized exchanges are most useful as an on- and off-ramp between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, with retail users going through extensive know-your-customer processes. These centralized entities, whose reserves and balance sheets are not required to be shared with users or the public, require prudent regulation just as legacy banks and lenders do. And FTX was regulated across the jurisdictions it operated in, just as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were. Bad loans, illiquid collateral and overleveraging have clearly happened in institutions dealing with regulated securities also (FTX held traditional as well as digital assets).But if investors and users of FTX had access to the same information that users of decentralized exchanges and protocols such as Uniswap and Aave do, this collapse would have been nearly impossible. Account holders on decentralized exchanges have full control of their own funds and can participate in the governance of the platform.Read more: Nic Carter - Let’s Actually Commit to Proofs of Reserve This Time, Okay?We’ve seen some other centralized exchanges responding to pressure recently to disclose their reserves, notably Binance and Crypto.com. While reserves don’t reveal corresponding liabilities, this is a positive development in the space toward self-regulation and applying decentralized financial practices to centralized institutions.FTX’s collapse highlights the need for more decentralized approaches. It’s notable, for example, that both FTX and Celsius Network, another centralized institution that collapsed in July of this year, repaid their decentralized finance (DeFi) loans first because they were publicly visible before eventually declaring bankruptcy. This is clear evidence of the need for data-rich, transparent accounting and compliance systems that protect participants while also preserving an individual’s privacy.Best practices that apply to DeFi and centralized crypto projects alike, in addition to self-disclosures of reserves and liabilities, might include on-chain asset registries or mandatory transaction posting. For exchanges, a hybrid approach might avoid an exchange custodying users’ funds while still offering recovery via centralized institutions (or support for social recovery).Regulation can only go so far in closed systems and walled gardens. Transparent code and public accountability can go much further in helping Web3 transition to a better future. By embracing the transparency of DeFi while continuing to invest in privacy-preserving technologies like zero-knowledge protocols, we can avoid situations that may lead to overreaching regulatory crackdowns while also creating safer environments for retail users and Web3 projects supporting real-world use cases.I’ve been thinking about these issues of trust and fairer financial systems since I was building my first projects as a coder growing up in Ukraine. I believe in Web3 because I want to build systems that are not easily corrupted or subject to takeover by a bad actor. I want citizens of the entire globe to be able to control their own assets and data rather than having to trust an untrustworthy bank or getting shut out of the system entirely because of their native nation’s economic status.After the events of the last week, I believe more than ever that the world needs Web3 to build a better digital infrastructure for the planet. FTX is not crypto. Let’s not judge the entire industry by its failure.",2022/11/22
326,"‘S-HERTOGENBOSCH, Netherlands – Alexey Pertsev has been ordered to stay in jail until Feb. 20 after a Netherlands court found the Tornado Cash developer represented a flight risk.Pertsev has been held in detention since August, days after the U.S. Treasury used sanction powers against the Tornado protocol, which it said had been used to launder over a billion dollars' worth of cryptocurrencies and to support North Korean hackers.At the hearing on Tuesday, Dutch public prosecutor Martine Boerlage announced money-laundering charges for the first time. Boerlage had said little more about the case than a press release, but has now accused Pertsev of facilitating the processing of dirty money by writing the Tornado Cash code.Boerlage brushed aside arguments that Tornado Cash was a decentralized protocol that Pertsev was powerless to control, claiming that it was in fact one and the same as PepperSec, a company Pertsev worked for alongside fellow developers Roman Semenov and Roman Storm.Outside the courtroom, Pertsev’s lawyer, Keith Cheng, told CoinDesk he was “very disappointed” with the decision.“It's clear to us that these judges are not as familiar with the subject matter as they should be,” Cheng said. “At the moment, the case law regarding criminal activities is all about bitcoin mixers … It's very important that the court understands that Tornado Cash is something different.”Pertsev’s arrest and detention has drawn widespread outcry, including protests in Amsterdam and a tweet from Edward Snowden, an American who now lives in Russia after he leaked documents from the National Security Agency, comparing Pertsev’s treatment to the kid gloves afforded to executives at collapsed crypto exchange FTX.“If you peel everything off, what we have here is a fairly clear-cut money-laundering case,” Boerlage said, citing laws that forbid the concealment of funds’ origin and movement. “That's exactly what a mixing service like Tornado Cash does for you.”Boerlage compared the vast sums of money deposited into the protocol after the Ronin Bridge hack with a bank clerk unquestioningly accepting a pile of 100 euro notes for deposit.“If you as a bank don't know where the money is coming from and haven't yet built in any mechanism to look at that, then there’s a considerable likelihood that your service is laundering money,” she said.Boerlage also denied claims that the software was autonomous, saying that Pertsev and others had de facto control.That Pertsev “has nothing to do with Tornado Cash, can be relegated to the realm of fantasy,” the prosecutor said. Pertsev, Semenov and Storm may have held so many tokens for the protocol they could in practice ”always outvote everyone else” when it came to decision making, Boerlage added.Private chats obtained by the prosecutor between the three showed that in practice they made operational decisions about the protocol, and had effectively acknowledged they were involved in “shady stuff” when they discussed tweeting about how to circumvent money-laundering norms, she said.“PepperSec is Tornado Cash,” Boerlage added, referring to Pertsev’s idea that he could be released to return to his previous employer as long as he declined to work on the protocol.Cheng, meanwhile, argued that the service had legitimate uses.“The goal of Tornado Cash is to bring privacy for the user, giving the user control over crypto transactions,” Cheng said. The prosecution had not convincingly demonstrated specific facts linking Pertsev to the alleged crime as required by Dutch and European law, Cheng added.Pertsev himself spoke little, though, speaking through a Russian interpreter, confirmed his personal details and referred to the online petition and demonstrations that have been held in his support.“I am ready to accept all restrictions” should he be released on bail, he said, before his request was declined. “I just want to be able to spend Christmas with my wife.”Read more: US Treasury Adds to Tornado Cash Sanctions With North Korea WMD AllegationsUpdate (Nov. 22, 2022 14:35 UTC): Adds details throughout article.Correction (Nov. 23, 2022 13:44 UTC): Corrects final Pertsev quote.",2022/11/22

The miner had 1,051 BTC and $29.5 million in cash at the end of September.Core Scientific is one of several miners struggling to keep afloat as rising energy prices increase costs, and a stubbornly low bitcoin price slashes revenue.

Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Greenidge Generation (GREE) have also said they are strapped for cash.""We anticipate that existing cash resources will be depleted by the end of 2022 or sooner,"" Core Scientific said in its third-quarter earnings report, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday.

A class-action lawsuit was filed in the same month in Texas courts alleging failures to disclose important information to investors.The miner was running 232,000 machines in its facilities as of the end of the quarter, accounting for 13 exahash per second (EH/s) of bitcoin self-mining computing power, or hashrate, and 9.5 EH/s of hosted machines for other firms, according to the filing.

The case is being closely monitored by digital-asset traders partly because Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG), which also owns Grayscale Investments, manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is the largest publicly traded bitcoin fund. The speculation is that Genesis's financial straits might put DCG in the position of needing to dispose of assets, which under various scenarios might affect GBTC and spill over into the bitcoin market. (CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary of DCG.)""We expect the DCG/Genesis capital raise will be the big market moving event this week,"" Nauman Sheikh, head of treasury management at Wave Financial. ""A favorable outcome would lead to a market squeeze and an unfavorable outcome has the potential to do some serious damage.""A Bloomberg report that Genesis had mentioned bankruptcy as a potential option briefly sent bitcoin (BTC) to a fresh two-year low of $15,480, but the price was back to about $15,900 as of press time.The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar, reported that Genesis sought funding from Binance and Apollo Global Management, and that Binance declined to invest, citing potential conflicts of interest.""We have no plans to file bankruptcy imminently,"" a Genesis spokesperson said. ""Our goal is to resolve the current situation consensually without the need for any bankruptcy filing. Genesis continues to have constructive conversations with creditors.""Mike Dershewitz, head of risk committee at Arca Funds, wrote Monday: ""DCG can also sell off a portion of its Grayscale equity. Assuming $300 million in annual net income, this cash flow stream should be worth at least $2.5 billion, depending on how a would-be investor/buyer values the longevity of this cash-flow stream.""Singaporean regulators under scrutiny after FTX collapseThe collapse of the FTX exchange forced the Monetary Authority of Singapore last week to address what it characterized as “questions and misperceptions” about its prior regulatory treatment of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto-trading venue.One narrative centers on whether FTX received favorable treatment from the island nation’s central bank. Singapore's state investment fund, Temasek, had a $210 million investment in FTX that it has now written off entirely.A key question is why Binance.sg – an affiliate of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume – was placed on an Investor Alert List (IAL), while FTX was not.Recently, the regulator released a 15-point statement addressing the issue. Central to the regulator’s argument is that Binance was actively soliciting Singapore residents, while FTX was not.Except, this is not entirely the case.MAS says one of the reasons is that Binance supported the Singapore dollar (SGD) in order to onboard Singapore-based users, and FTX didn’t.FTX began support for the SGD as an asset class a few weeks before its demise according to a list of supported assets. Users would still have to wire in USD, unlike Binance.SG, which supported local payment gateways.FTX-owned Liquid also supports the StraitsX XSGD stablecoin to, in the words of the exchange, “better serve our Singapore trading community.”MAS also said that Binance solicited Singaporean users because of advertising campaigns directed at them.And yet FTX did the same.Token 2049, a major crypto conference that took place in the halcyon days of September 2022, counted FTX as one of its sponsors. The exchange’s logo-adorned swag was visible throughout the venue to anyone in attendance.Days after the Token 2049 conference was the Singapore Formula 1 Grand Prix, which saw the FTX-sponsored Mercedes-AMG Petronas team compete – complete with the exchange’s logos available on the car and drivers’ hats for everyone to see.It wasn’t too long ago that MAS put DeFiance Capital on the same list without giving much of a reason. While the inclusion on the list doesn’t necessarily mean there was legal impropriety, DeFiance Capital officials said they were flummoxed by the decision.1:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(5:30 UTC) Canada Retail Sales (MoM/Sept)10:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(14:00 UTC) Australia's S&P Global Manufacturing PMI (Nov)1:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(17:00 UTC) New Zealand Reserve Bank Monetary Policy StatementIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:FTX Owes Its Largest Creditor $226M; More Than 50% of Bitcoin Addresses Are Now in LossCourt documents filed over the weekend reveal FTX owes an estimated one million creditors about $3.1 billion collectively.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to the $15,500 level, nearing a two-year low, amid a gloomy market climate following the FTX collapse. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading as low as $15,591, close to the 52-week low of $15,554. Bitcoin had settled back to around $15,800 as of press time, down roughly 5% in the past 24 hours. “If the $15,500 level breaks for bitcoin, there is not much support until the $13,500 level, followed by the psychological $10,000 level,” Edward Moya, Oanda senior market analyst for the Americas, wrote in a Monday note.Ether (ETH) slid further to the $1,080 level, down 8%. A CoinShares report Monday said short-ether investment products – those that bet on a price decline – saw the largest inflows on record, with net inflows of $14 million in the seven days ended Nov. 18. The negative sentiments around ether could attribute to the uncertainty over the upcoming Shanghai update and the hacked FTX ETH assets, which sum to around $280 million, according to CoinShares.",2022/11/21
333,"Bitcoin and ether prices, down 4% and 12% over the last seven days, are approaching traditionally oversold levels, when using the RSI as a tool of measurement. The question is whether that even matters.RSI, or the relative strength index, is a commonly used tool in technical analysis. I personally use it frequently, with the caveat being that I tend to use a 10-day RSI as opposed to the conventionally used 14-day RSI.Part of the RSI’s popularity is driven by its relatively straightforward set of “rules.” While not ironclad, they allow novices as well as seasoned professionals to quickly evaluate an asset’s price level and determine where it falls in the range of cheap vs. expensive.In general, an RSI reading of 70 or more indicates that an asset is “overbought,” while a reading of 30 or less implies that an asset is “oversold.” The RSI levels for BTC and ETH are about 32 and 34, respectively.Traders using RSI in isolation may be looking to soon establish long positions, with the rationale that the sell-off has gone too far. But how would this have worked historically?Looking back at pricing data from January 2015 for BTC and November 2017 for ETH shows the following: (Note the mismatch in the start date results from availability of ETH pricing data.)RSI for BTC has fallen below 30, 106 times. The average one-day, seven-day and 30-day returns following a sub-30 reading have been 1.3%, 3.8% and 7.2% respectively.RSI for ETH has fallen below 30, 118 times, implying that ETH has been an undersold asset more often than BTC, despite the shorter date range. The average one-day, seven-day and 30-day returns following a sub-30 reading have been 0%, -1.8% and 13.5%.So where does that leave us? Given current RSI levels, not too bad off actually. Applying an RSI range of greater than 32 and less than 35 shows 79 and 67 occurrences over our data set for both BTC and ETH.Both were essentially flat over the one- and seven-day periods, but we saw average returns of 4.6% and 5.5% for BTC and ETH over the next 30 days.This data shows that in the past investors have seen gains, buying BTC and ETH at the current RSI levels. They have done better, however, when buying when RSI fell below 30.Ultimately, this depends on past relationships continuing into the future. That is certainly not guaranteed, especially given the backdrop of contagion risks in the crypto sector and macroeconomic fears.But examining what has and hasn't mattered to date may give investors an opening framework.",2022/11/21
334,"Federal prosecutors in Washington state have charged two Estonian citizens with running a series of crypto scams that allegedly defrauded hundreds of thousands of investors around the world of a combined $575 million.According to the indictment released Monday, Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turogin – both 37-year-old residents of Tallinn, Estonia – were partners in a series of interconnected fraudulent schemes using cryptocurrency. The two defendants allegedly used a variety of shell companies to launder the proceeds of their schemes, and spent investor funds on luxury cars and real estate in Estonia.Their first company, HashCoins, which launched in December 2013, purported to be a manufacturer of crypto mining equipment, and took orders (and payment in full) from customers who wanted to purchase miners. However, according to the indictment, HashCoins never manufactured anything – instead, it re-sold mining equipment purchased on the open market and found reasons to delay the shipment of the majority of its sales.In May 2015, facing a growing number of angry customers, Potapenko and Turogin allegedly started a second company, HashFlare. According to prosecutors, they told their clientele that orders for mining equipment would be converted to “remote mining services” and – instead of the physical equipment they were promised – those sending funds would receive a share of the service’s profits.Prosecutors, though, say Potapenko and Turogin ran HashFlare more like a Ponzi scheme than a mining operation, and accused them of actually mining less than 1% of all the mining hashrate sold to customers.HashFlare’s customers were allegedly shown statements with fraudulent crypto balances. When customers tried to cash out, prosecutors say Potapenko and Turogin attempted to give them the run-around, coming up with reasons why they could not pay out and making them jump through legal hoops, such as fulfilling know-your-customer (KYC) requirements before they could be paid.While HashFlare continued to operate, Potapenko and Turogin allegedly started another venture, Polybius Bank, which was marketed as a crypto bank based in Estonia. According to the indictment, the pair advertised an initial coin offering (ICO) for the project in June 2017, which raised $25 million from investors around the world. The project fizzled shortly thereafter.In 2018, HashFlare announced that it was shutting down, citing rising energy costs and claiming that bitcoin mining was no longer profitable even as prosecutors say Potapenko and Turogin continued mining for themselves, using miners that they’d purchased with stolen customer funds.By the time HashFlare officially shuttered in August 2019, prosecutors say it had raised a total of $550 million.Potapenko and Turogin are both charged with one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 16 counts each of wire fraud, one count each of conspiracy to commit money laundering.Both Potapenko and Turogin were arrested in Tallinn on Nov. 20. A jury trial has been demanded in the Western District of Washington.UPDATE (21:21 UTC): Modifies headline to reflect that Potapenko and Turogin are Estonian citizens, and adds that they were arrested in Tallinn.

335,"Crypto investors allocated the majority of their assets in short investment products last week, signaling “deeply negative” sentiment for digital currencies amid the recent bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX.Short investment products, which bet on the price of an asset to drop, accounted for 75% of all inflows, a report by digital asset investment and trading group CoinShares found. Inflows for bitcoin (BTC) totaled $14 million, but considering the popularity of short-term investment vehicles, net flows added up to a negative $4.3 million.Inflows into short-ether (ETH) investment products also hit a new high of $14 million, while the blockchain-based token only saw minor outflows, the report showed.The data shows that investors are deeply scared by FTX’s collapse, which was once regarded as one of the most trusted crypto exchanges but turned into possibly the biggest fraud in crypto history.“On aggregate sentiment was deeply negative for the asset class, likely being a direct result of the ongoing fallout from the FTX collapse,” James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares said.Read more: FTX’s Collapse a Wake-Up Call for Venture Capitalists, Dragonfly Partner SaysTotal asset under management (AUM), which represents the total market value of investments held by an entity on behalf of investors, dropped to $22 billion, its lowest point in two years.The price of bitcoin is down over 16% in the past month and ether is trading just under 15% lower.

337,"Shares of the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) hit their lowest price since the company went public in April 2021.COIN dropped to $40.62 on Monday, down 10% on the day and 39% in November as investors retreated from digital assets, in part thanks to the fallout from the bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX.Coinbase's shares traded at slightly over $400 last year on the day the company went public on the Nasdaq, which turned out to be their highest point. (At the time at least one expert warned investors should “buckle up their seatbelts and expect a wild ride.”)The bitcoin (BTC) price rose to a record high near $69,000 in November 2021, but crypto markets have been falling ever since, as have Coinbase's shares. The stock has lost more than 80% of its value this year, underperforming most cryptocurrencies.“Coinbase shares can't catch a break,” Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said. “The major cryptocurrency exchange has yet to convince investors that its share price will stabilize like some of the other top cryptos as investor skepticism about trading on exchanges grows.""Bonds issued by Coinbase also dipped in November as investors’ appetite for crypto tanked after FTX’s bankruptcy triggered industry-wide contagion. Coinbase’s bonds dropped 15% in value this month and are trading at 50 cents on the dollar, according to data firm Finra-Morningstar.“Coinbase has a small exposure to FTX, but most of the recent weakness is stemming from concerns many crypto traders might be opting for cold storage instead of keeping money on exchanges,” Moya said. “Coinbase has a tough road ahead until investors have further clarity on the company's reserves and exposure to other crypto assets.”",2022/11/21

339,"The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is drawing market attention after sister company Genesis Global Capital said its lending unit would halt customer withdrawals as a result of fallout from the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto empire, Bernstein said in a research report Monday.The situation at Genesis, however, does not directly affect GBTC, the report said. Even if Genesis is unable to raise liquidity for its lending book and files for bankruptcy, creditors would have no claim on GBTC assets.Grayscale Investments, which manages GBTC, and Genesis are both owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG), as is CoinDesk.“GBTC’s trust structure protects its holders and remains ring-fenced from failures within DCG or DCG group entities,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.The market is concerned that Grayscale could be “considered for strategic options in case of catastrophe,” the note said. But DCG, even in the most adverse scenario, would prefer to hold onto Grayscale over Genesis, it said. Greyscale is DCG’s “flagship business and its cash cow,” generating around $300 million a year in fees, according to Bernstein.GBTC currently trades at a massive 45% discount to the price of the underlying bitcoin (BTC), the note said, meaning investors are trapped in an investment vehicle they can exit only after a six-month lock-in period and with a significant discount.GBTC is the largest bitcoin investment vehicle and holds more than $10.5 billion of BTC.

341,"Bonds issued by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) and by MicroStrategy (MSTR), a business-intelligence company and investor in bitcoin, have slumped as investor confidence in the industry slid in the wake of FTX's collapse.Coinbase's bond due 2031 has dropped 15% this month to 50 U.S. cents on the dollar, according to data source Finra-Morningstar, sending the yield – which moves in the opposite direction to price – to a record high 13.5%. The decline comes after nearly three months of consolidation and marks an extension of the bearish trend seen early this year. The yield on the company's bond due in 2026 jumped to 17%.Bonds tied to MicroStrategy have taken a similar beating. On Friday, the yield on the company's 2028 notes, issued last year to finance bitcoin (BTC) accumulation, climbed to 13.35% as the price dropped to a record 72.5 cents on the dollar. MicroStrategy holds about 130,000 BTC worth approximately $2.08 billion on its balance sheet.The companies' bonds carry a premium of around 1,000 basis points – or 10 percentage points – to the U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield, as of Friday. In traditional markets, a premium of that level is taken to represent credit stress. The 10-year Treasury was yielding 3.80% at press time.""High bond yields are reflective of sharply higher rates but also of genuine skepticism about the long-term viability of crypto amongst institutional investors after the high profile collapses of Terra/LUNA, Celsius [Network], 3AC [Three Arrows Capital], Voyager [Digital], BlockFi and FTX,"" Mike Alfred, a value investor and founder of digital assets investment platform Eaglebrook Advisors, said.Rich Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR, said the uptick in bond yields represents heightened credit risk.""Especially for Coinbase, there is an argument that it benefits from FTX’s demise, solidifying their position in the U.S. So the narrative is improving on a micro level, whereas the crypto credit environment has deteriorated,"" Rosenblum told CoinDesk.The Sam Bankman-Fried-founded digital assets exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, triggering concern of a market-wide contagion. Prominent venture capital firm Multicoin, one of the many exposed to FTX, told investors its net performance had dropped 55% this month and said FTX's collapse would wipe out many firms in the coming weeks, according to CNBC.""Those bond yields were actually the first sign of weakness in the space. It was the canary in the coal mine, a sign of stress in the crypto space even before all the blowups this year,"" Darius Sit, founder and chief investment officer at crypto options trading firm QCP Capital, said. Sit said his firm would monitor the yields as a ""possible leading sign of recovery.""While Coinbase may be insulated from direct fallout of the FTX collapse, its vulnerability to other adverse effects, such as reduced trading levels, may make investing in Coinbase bonds or stocks unappealing. That's certainly what many in the investor community seem to be thinking.Last week, Goldman Sachs maintained a sell rating on Coinbase shares and slashed its 12-month price target to $41 from $49, saying that once FTX-induced volatility subsides, the lower level of crypto prices and the potential for reduced investor confidence will weigh on trading volumes. Shares in Coinbase have dropped 31% this month, ending Friday at $45.26.""If you have capital at Coinbase – do your counterparty risk assessment now,"" Lawrence McDonald, the author of the popular Bear Traps report, tweeted on Sunday after noting the spike in bond yields and the share-price decline.Some investors believe bonds tied to Coinbase and MicroStrategy are a safer way to bet on a crypto bull revival. While that's true, bonds are likely to underperform spot bitcoin.""Bonds are a safer route since usually there is some recovery, even in the event of bankruptcy.

The language has been modified accordingly.Good morning.

The industry might be better off if major initiatives such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Solana wound down.Cryptos Take a Late Weekend PlungeBy James RubinFour days before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, crypto markets decided they didn't have much for which to be thankful.Bitcoin was recently down 2.8% over the past 24 hours (UTC), although it managed to hold snugly above its most recent $16,000 support for a 12th consecutive day. Last week, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization weathered the cascade of misadventures tied to crypto exchange FTX's collapse, although Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote in an email to CoinDesk that investors should gird themselves for a rocky week ahead.""The last week saw bitcoin trading in a very tight range, unable to breach $17K conclusively,"" DiPasquale wrote. ""However, given the sideways action, we can expect volatility in the coming week.""Ether was recently trading below its most recent $1,200 support and was down over 6% from Saturday, same time. The second-largest crypto in market value has plummeted almost 10% from its high of $1,275 last week. Other major cryptos dove deeply into the red with sports fan coin CHZ plunging more than 14%. CHZ and fan tokens for national soccer teams had been on an upswing recently amid euphoria for the World Cup, which kicked off Sunday with Ecuador defeating the host nation Qatar.Popular meme coin DOGE, and Crypto.com's CRO token, were recently trading down more than 10%.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, was down 0.4% and about where it stood a week ago. The Fear and Greed index, a measure of market sentiment about crypto, remained in extreme fear territory – its standing throughout much of the growing FTX crisis.Crypto prices veered from equity markets, an increasing occurrence in recent weeks as the major indexes each closed slightly higher on Friday two days after the Commerce Department's monthly retail report showed surprisingly resilient consumer spending. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.01%, while the S&P 500, which has a strong tech component, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) climbed 0.48% and 0.59%, respectively.Traditional markets have also been unaffected by FTX's spectacular flameout and now daily revelations about its mismanagement. On Sunday, CoinDesk's Shaurya Malwa (a regular contributor to this newsletter) wrote that whoever was behind the $600 million exploit of FTX on Nov. 11 had started exchanging millions of dollars worth of ether to ren bitcoin (renBTC), a token that represents bitcoin on other blockchains.Earlier in the week, Malwa reported that funds stolen from FTX were steadily converted to ether over the past week, making the exploiter one of the largest holders of the token.BitBull's DiPasquale said that bulls will be looking for ongoing support above bitcoin's brief low at about $15,500 earlier this month as FTX's severe liquidity problems became apparent. ""Once that range is evident, consolidation around that low could see the price shooting toward $18k in the near term,"" he wrote.Would Crypto Thrive Again Through Subtraction?By Sam ReynoldsIn a year, we might look back at the spectacular fraud-filled collapse of FTX as a good thing.Its demise has confirmed many people’s worst fears about the digital assets industry: that it's an unregulated free-for-all, established behind elaborate corporate structures in jurisdictions that are conveniently out of reach of Western courts.For the most part, this is correct (see: the leviathan of legal entities that is FTX).There’s also the question that’s being answered in real time about how much of crypto is “funny money,” a concocted entity without worth based on an unsustainable structure, and not “sound money,” a fundamental store of value.Right now, we can watch this all come apart. Here are two examples.1. GBTC’s current discountGrayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)’s shares are now trading at a discount of 45% below the net asset value.(CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary of Digital Currency Group [DCG], which also owns Grayscale.)A total of $10.53 billion in capital is right now handicapped because it holds shares in something that trades less than the value of the asset it holds. And there’s no way to redeem these shares for bitcoin.Data on a 13F form (a quarterly form filled out by fund managers) shows that institutions have been dropping GBTC during the last few quarters thanks to DCG’s buyback programs. This has made DCG the largest shareholder of the Trust.The end goal for GBTC is to transform it into an exchange-traded fund, but the Securities and Exchange Commission blocks that with every chance it gets. So why not wind down the trust? Sure, many of the large holders will take a loss, but there are billions of dollars of impaired capital that should have a better home.2. Ethereum killers' strugglesSpeaking of impaired capital, many would-be Ethereum killers have been struggling mightily.Solana began the year with a total value locked of over $6 billion and may end the year with under $200 million if current trends continue. When compared to its peak value of $10 billion at the height of the bull market, there’s just over 2.8% of its locked-in value currently left. Many of the protocols that operate on Solana have been totally wiped out, according to data from DeFiLlama.Surely, some of the venture capitalists that backed Solana and encouraged retail investors to ape-in during the ""Solana Summer"" took profit during the early days. But any exposure remaining on the balance sheets must be an anchor.Just like the investors who apparently did their due diligence on FTX and missed the glaring holes the new CEO found in a week, how could these investors miss the problems with Solana? Did their due diligence not reveal that a good majority of the ecosystem was effectively a Russian nesting doll of fakery, as CoinDesk reported a few months ago? Or did they just want to put the pump on the coin?But for as much as we talk about Solana that could be a distraction from larger would-be ethereum killers lurking beneath the surface.

An additional 35,000 ether was then moved to that wallet over three separate transactions.On-chain analysis of the new wallet shows the exploiter subsequently started to convert ether to renBTC using the decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch. The first of such transactions had 4,000 ether being converted to wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), another bitcoin representative token, and then to renBTC.The exploiter continued to convert ether to renBTC over several transactions, blockchain data shows.Data cited by security firm PeckShield shows the exploiter used the Ren bridge to transfer out thousands of renBTC. Bridges are blockchain-based tools that allow users to exchange tokens between different networks.As per a study by blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, the Ren bridge has been previously used to launder stolen funds to the tune of at least $540 million – as it may provide privacy to users, per the Elliptic report.UPDATE (Nov. 12, 2022, 14:03 UTC): Clarifies the possible usage of Ren for laundering money.",2022/11/20
344,"The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to high-profile blowups and cults of personality, and there have been several this year alone. But even by crypto standards, the FTX story is notable for the shocking revelations that have come to light. The rapid downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried is likely a watershed moment for the entire industry.Steven Lubka, a CoinDesk columnist, is managing director of Swan Private Client Services, a concierge service for high-net-worth investors at Swan Bitcoin.Much will be written on FTX from a mainstream point of view, and much will be written from the point of view of cryptocurrency investors. You'll hear a lot about FTX from the various venture capitalists (VC) who populate the industry and other influencers who cover decentralized finance (DeFi), Web3 and NFTs (aka non-fungible tokens).Inevitably, the story that will be shared by crypto insiders will be ""FTX was terrible but it just displays the problems with centralized companies and highlights the benefits of decentralized protocols.""See also: FTX Showed the Problems of Centralized Finance (and Promises of DeFi) | OpinionWhat if that misses the point? The culture, norms and values of crypto had a central role in the rise (and fall) of FTX, more than these voices are likely to admit. Just take it from the bitcoin perspective.You probably think of bitcoiners (or Bitcoin Maxis) as an odd bunch.We look like strange fundamentalists who simply cannot wrap our minds around the innovation and possibilities inherent in digital assets other than bitcoin. We won't make any compromises and pursue a very narrow vision for how to develop and continue to grow the Bitcoin protocol.Bitcoiners can seem like the Amish of Crypto. Weird, right? This perception of bitcoiners is cyclical: We are still coming off the heady highs of yet another crypto bull run and many still believe crypto will bounce back. At the highest moments the possibilities seemed endless, money was falling out of the sky and blockchain was going to change the world. People abandoned the basic precepts of going beyond financial intermediaries. (Why would you self-custody your coins when you can earn 10% lending through Celsius?)Then came the blowups: Terra, Celsius Network, Three Arrows Capital, Voyager Digital (and many others only saved by bailouts and equity infusions).The darling coins and new ideas lost 90%+ of their value. The counterparty risk suddenly reared its ugly head. Maybe the position bitcoiners take makes more sense to you now. Maybe not.During bull runs, bitcoiners look like stubborn fools who just can't understand the possibilities. However, during bear markets, their ideals, values, and approach start to make more sense to people who do a little investigation. The culture of bitcoin, at its heart, is one of hard-won insights. Lessons learned. Money lost.See also: Bitcoiners Were Right: Weaponized Finance Just Created a Post Dollar Planet | OpinionIn many ways, FTX validates the way bitcoiners approach this industry. Let's explore how!At the absolute core of Bitcoin is a single principle: we must de-financialize. This is absolutely antithetical to the entire ethos of crypto, which gives anyone the ability to instantly financialize assets. For me, this is actually the most profound divide between Bitcoin and Crypto.Bitcoin is trying to de-financialize an overly leveraged, financialized world. Crypto is trying to further financialize everything.Crypto wants art, music, games, login credentials and anything else they can get their hands on to become financialized. Bitcoiners think leverage, subsidization of risk and turning everything into a speculative asset is actually massively net-negative for civilization.I'll paint you an example: houses. The real estate market is a perfect example of what financialization looks like. Houses have always been valuable, but they haven't always been financial assets in the ways they are today. As soon as the government subsidized the risk for lenders in making home loans, and the central banks made money cheap for mortgage lenders; the price of houses exploded becoming unaffordable for many.Owning a home is an important aspect of societal cohesion. It's actually “proof-of-stake” for nations. Homeowners become stakeholders in the nation. They form families and they start to care about the long-term prospects of the nation. Financializing houses made them progressively unaffordable and undermined societal cohesion and financialization is everywhere in the contemporary economy.FTX couldn't have existed without a culture that values financialization for its own sake. It became a popular exchange by offering traders insane leverage and the ability to collateralize almost any of their altcoin holdings (unlike many derivatives exchanges, and all spot markets). FTX also listed more exotic derivatives products than other exchanges and spent a lot of time optimizing their liquidation engine (yes, this made liquidations kinder but it also represented a push into more leverage).Leverage is a weird thing. The optimal amount of leverage is always zero leverage, according to economists Ole Peters and Alexander Adamou. When people identify a market with low volatility and decide to take on leverage to juice returns, they end up inducing volatility into that market via the leverage itself.See also: Why Bitcoin Has Been Highly Correlated With Fiat | OpinionThat means leverage can never work in the long term. Yes, I know you know someone who made a fortune with a risky leveraged bet over a few weeks, but structurally, over the long term, leverage can never yield structural outperformance of markets as the presence of leverage itself leads to blowups that liquidate the leveraged.This increased volatility results in liquidations for levered players and shows the optimal leverage is always zero. FTX was an endorsement of leverage and financialization. Bankman-Fried said recently that he let it get out of hand, thinking his hedge fund could make a bigger impact if it made bigger bets.Leverage was bad for users, bad for hedge funds and bad for FTX itself. Bitcoiners often push for full-reserve spot markets, and advise new users to stay away from leverage and to reduce their counterparty risk.FTX was built on the opposite principles.The crypto community often picks its champions based on one criteria: whether they make money. FTX is what happens when we divorce wealth and success from morality and ethics. It's extremely likely that SBF at some point misappropriated customer deposits to perform ""effective altruism.""In this sense, Bankman-Fried serves as the paragon of an industry: someone who is fine with harming others if it furthers his definition of the good. There’s a long line of influential people in crypto that came before him that essentially operated on the same principle, even if they didn’t directly steal or grift. Bankman-Fried is the culmination of contemporary crypto culture, a phenomenon enabled by VCs, media and users alike, Bankman-Fried is the output you get when your input is the contemporary values of the crypto community.Now, that’s not to say bitcoiners are allergic to wealth or success. The difference is that wealth is good when it is generated *ethically* and *morally.* Wealth is good when it comes from providing value to the world or building something that matters.Ethics? Morals? Here go the bitcoiners moralizing again!I get it. Hearing about how there is a morality gap between Bitcoin and Crypto sounds like fundamentalism. But it only comes from understanding the incentives and values which are behind the past 50 years of economic change and thinning. A paradigm that saw the rise of financial service providers over industry. Financialization over value creation. And capital depletion over capital creation. In other words, postmodern finance.Glorifying financialization, amoral wealth creation and unrestricted issuance of financial instruments have created a system of incentives that enabled fraud, manipulation and deceit to happen repeatedly.Maybe you know of a crypto founder who is acting in good faith, really believes in their project and hasn't taken advantage of their token’s issuance mechanisms in any way – wonderful! These people certainly exist.However, empowering anyone (including anonymous founders) to issue financial instruments in a completely unrestricted manner while funding them with an endless stream of cheap VC cash has created an unsustainable system. Worse, opaque claims about “innovation” and utopian visions of a future without hierarchies enticed retail investors and created a situation with comically bad incentives. Is anyone actually surprised Sam Bankman-Fried got his start during the initial coin offering boom?Further, the ability of a centralized team to control the issuance of a token is highly contentious. You can say tokens are a way to decentralize ownership and influence in a project, but if you look at what happens in practice instead of, in theory, you will find massively concentrated ownership among insiders.Tokens are issued as though they were equity, and serve the exact same role for founders – that's because founders are selling tokens to fund their joint ventures. Why are securities regulated in traditional financial markets?Because over hundreds of years we have observed time and time again that allowing people unrestricted access to the sale of financial instruments which were minted from thin air resulted in continuous abuses of power.See also: The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Culture | OpinionDoes that mean securities laws are perfect? Does it mean that the Securities and Exchange Commission is infallible? Of course not. But it does show us that being able to issue tokens from thin air is at the heart of so many disastrous crypto outcomes.Regardless of what they actually are, people buy tokens believing they are a type of equity. They think they represent ownership in the protocol.Did FTT represent ownership in FTX? ABSOLUTELY NOT! But people treated it like it did, despite being a worthless integer in a spreadsheet that FTX controlled unilaterally. FTX would not have happened if:The entire scheme relied on FTX being able to borrow against FTT. Why? Because if it had to sell FTT the market would have gone illiquid as there were few natural buyers.FTX used this same playbook to inflate its assets using Serum, MAPS and OXY. It discovered it could seize control of ""decentralized protocols,"" acquire a huge percentage of the supply and artificially pump the value into an illiquid market.See also: Why Selling Some Bitcoin at a Loss Can Maximize Your Holding Potential | OpinionDeFi, or decentralized finance, provided absolutely no protection against this. Despite creating non-custodial and verifiable protocols, DeFi has also created the cultural precedent where centralized teams of developers behind the scenes control of keys and almost always the coins. Bankman-Fried likely saw he could game this ... and did, like in the strange Sushi storyline.Ironically, the crypto world loves to champion decentralization. They say we need decentralized protocols, decentralized exchanges, decentralized everything. But crypto loves centralized issuance of tokens. Why is no one fighting for purely decentralized issuance of these tokens?Proof-of-work mining was designed as a fair issuance system where there are no privileged insiders and everyone competes for tokens by doing costly work. This isn't sufficient if insiders can start mining before others, but as long as there is a fair launch mining is the most decentralized way to bring a token to market.If you remove the ability for companies and teams to issue tokens, you suck the air out of so many of these abuses.There is more to the story, but these three core tenets are at the heart of the FTX saga: financialization, separating wealth from ethics and centralized issuance of tokens. There is a rot at the core of the cryptocurrency universe, and it is fueled by allowing these trends to propagate and fostering a culture of predation.Ideologically, crypto was supposed to be a break from the traditional financial system, yet it has largely only succeeded in recreating some of the worst aspects of modern finance – only with fewer guardrails. Crypto is peak Wall Street, an acceleration of financialization, amoral business and the cult of personalities.Bitcoiners fight for de-financialization, moral accrual of wealth and protocols built without centralized token issuance. This is one reason Bitcoin matters. It offers us a pathway to a new system (or perhaps a return to an older system – things weren't always like this!).See also: The Bitcoiners Who Live 'Permanently Not There'The FTX story will be spun as something which is fixable by DeFi. You will hear this. I don't think it's true. DeFi protocols themselves (separated from tokens, etc.) may do some things well, like enabling non-custodial financial services through programs that stick to a predetermined set of rules and are independently verifiable.But there’s a difference between theory and practice. DeFi didn't stop FTX from capturing the decentralized exchange Serum or other protocols. Perhaps DeFiers will say, ""Well, that's not real DeFi."" Yes, and the Soviet Union wasn’t ""Real Communism,"" it was just what happens every time we try it.",2022/11/19

349,"Shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world’s largest publicly traded crypto fund, are trading at a new record discount of 43% relative to the price of the underlying bitcoin (BTC).Crypto analysts are speculating as to the reason, but the added pressure comes after Genesis Global Capital, an arm of Digital Currency Group (DCG), owner of Grayscale Investments, which manages GBTC, announced this week that it would halt customer withdrawals from its lending unit – stemming from the fallout from the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto empire. (CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, known as DCG.)Grayscale Investments reassured investors on Wednesday that the Genesis was “not a counterparty or service provider for any Grayscale product,” and that Grayscale products would “continue to operate business as usual.”The GBTC shares have not traded at a premium to the underlying bitcoin since March 2021, according to data from Coinglass, and the discount has widened this year along with distress in crypto markets and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission refusal to allow a conversion of the fund into an exchange-traded fund.GBTC is an investment vehicle that allows U.S. investors to gain exposure to price movements of BTC without buying the asset itself. The crypto fund Three Arrows Capital was a large holder of GBTC, and told Bloomberg in July that arbitrage trading the premium was one of the factors that led to its collapse earlier this year.For some investors, the recent widening of the discount may have made the vehicle even more attractive: Bloomberg reported that Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management bought more than 315,000 shares worth roughly $2.8 million of GBTC shares earlier this week.This week's move by Genesis has sparked speculation online that Grayscale might alter its current strategy, which consists of keeping the fund going while simultaneously suing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the agency’s rejection of the ETF conversion.According to QCP Capital, many observers are now expecting DCG to ""use the most liquid part of the business – Grayscale – to shore up Genesis and other parts of the business.""“We had written off a potential sale of GBTC’s BTC assets in our 2022 year outlook, although we never expected it to be under such circumstances,” said QCP in a note Friday.The friction is that Grayscale would then have to give up rights to a contractual stream of fees, currently 2% of assets under management.There's also the question of DCG's own holdings of GBTC. In October 2021, DCG said in an announcement it had purchased $388 million worth of GBTC shares.QCP said that “those expecting GBTC to allow a one-off redemption for Genesis to meet liquidity needs are misguided, as this has to be done with the [Securities and Exchange Commission's] approval.”“With all of the SEC's opposition to GBTC this year, we certainly don't expect this to happen anytime soon,"" QCP wrote.

350,"Bitcoin held steady over its most recent $16,000 support for a 10th consecutive day, even as contagion triggered by the collapse of FTX widened.Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading at around $16,600 Friday, roughly unchanged over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) was recently changing hands at about $1,200 and was also flat from Thursday, same time.Over the past seven days, BTC and ETH have declined 1.5% and ETH 4.8%, respectively.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, barely moved as investors continued to absorb recent events stemming from crypto exchange giant FTX’s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last Friday and the latest revelations about its mismanagement.A note Friday by Coinbase Institutional attributed bitcoin and ether’s resilience in recent days to its “relatively limited” exposure on FTX’s balance sheet, creating a buffer for potential mass liquidations.“The recent performance of these assets may also reflect implicit recognition that the events at FTX were credit driven, not crypto driven in nature,” Coinbase Head of Institutional Research David Duong and Research Analyst Brian Cubellis wrote in the note.However, other crypto observers maintain that the continued domino effect following FTX’s fallout is still difficult to gauge. The crypto market capitalization has fallen to under $800 billion, its lowest level since early 2021.Crypto asset trading firm QCP wrote in a Telegram note Friday that BTC and ETH have been unable to join the huge post-Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data short squeeze staged by global risk assets.The firm said that the underperformance of all crypto assets will remain “until the bulk of uncertainly has cleared up – likely only near the turn of the new year.”“This changes completely our previous view of a wave four-year-end macro rally that will be led in crypto by ETH,” the group added.‘Hodlers’ accumulateDespite overall bearish sentiment, crypto data and analysis firm IntoTheBlock’s on-chain data shows that BTC long-term holders increased their holdings by 180,000 BTC, close to $3 billion, since the FTX collapse.Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, said that historically BTC long-term holders “accumulate strongly in the depths of the bear market” and “begin selling following all-time highs.”“I would say that is most likely the main strategy Bitcoin believers are aspiring to recreate based on this on-chain data,” Outumuro told CoinDesk.",2022/11/18
351,"As the crypto community grapples with what led to this, its biggest-ever crisis, a look at Shakespeare and his various king characters is useful.Most of the bard’s monarchs are either megalomaniacal villains (Richard III, Claudius), dupes (Macbeth) or madmen (Lear). All of them are seduced by power, consumed by paranoia and fail to distinguish their self-interest from that of their subjects.There are no allegations that Sam Bankman-Fried poisoned anyone or plotted against his next of kin. But there is now jaw-dropping evidence that, closeted in an island compound with a small cabal of insiders, the erstwhile CEO of FTX wielded power in an erratic, unchecked and highly destructive manner. All this while he cultivated, promoted and largely succeeded in embedding in popular consciousness the glossy image of a wise and benevolent leader.You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.This wasn’t supposed to be the crypto way. Most FTX customers likely believed their investments in decentralized protocols supported systems that could free people, and their economic activity, from the need to trust a corruptible centralized authority. (Whether they understood the idea enough to discern which few tokens truly held such promise is a very different matter.)Yet, there are fewer modern communities that have been so undermined by the investment of excessive trust in a leader figure. Its root cause is the age-old human habit of hero worship.Crypto fanatics put this young, quirky leader on a pedestal, gave him the keys (literally) to the kingdom and allowed him to completely corrupt the authority they’d granted him. (Read the gob-smacking bankruptcy filing of SBF’s replacement CEO, John J. Ray III on the “unprecedented” accounting and business practices at FTX: a complete “failure of corporate controls,” an “absence of trustworthy financial information,” “compromised systems integrity,” and the “concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals.”)And while SBF’s FTX takes the cake for crypto’s biggest con in dollar terms, it’s noteworthy how many other conmen crypto has produced: Mt. Gox’s Mark Karpeles, QuadrigaX’s Gerald Cotton, OneCoin’s Ruja Ignatova. The list goes on.How could a community so obsessed with decentralized systems fall so frequently for the one thing it professes to resist? I’d say it’s a combination of interrelated, deeply human factors. Recognizing and understanding them is vital if the crypto community is to adopt a model of uber-governance that protects its members from being duped by such cons.Hero worship is universal. It’s primal. It starts with alpha apes and tribal leaders and leads to our historical obsession with wartime leaders like Lincoln or Churchill, with celebrity CEOs like Warren Buffett or Jack Welch, or with sport coaches like Bill Belichick or Vince Lombardi. There is something deep-seated and innate in this most social of instincts. All groups are fearful of survival and look to leadership to set direction and protect them from such challenges.So, if hero worship is innate and universal, anyone who advocates for a decentralized system to protect against its failings must also recognize that the same instinct lies within their own mind.Look at the subculture of Bitcoin since its early days and at its all-defining origin story: that its code was created by a single, brilliant man who selflessly bequeathed it to the world and kept his own name and potential for fame out of it. There have been songs about Satoshi Nakamoto, and poems, and artwork and a hagiographic volume of his “collected writings” (IRC posts). Read more: Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto?There’s nothing wrong, per se, with any of this. As I said, it’s a natural state of mind. In fact, it’s hard to imagine the crypto community – itself so important to the formation of an ecosystem of money and value exchange – cohesively forming without these kinds of myths and objects of reverence.What’s a problem is the denial that it exists, the idea that I’m not vulnerable to this kind of misplaced admiration because I’m a believer in math, not humans.This failure to see one’s own limitations is made doubly worse if you also have misplaced confidence in your safety because the system in which you believe you operate is supposed to be decentralized.Security experts frequently observe that the systems most vulnerable to attack are those where actors have excessive faith in that system’s invulnerability. A false sense of security creates an ideal environment for an intruder.The same goes for corruption. If there is outsized, unfounded trust in the incorruptibility of an ultimately flawed system, rogue actors can more easily abuse people.How many of FTX’s customers mistakenly believed their investments were secure because the tokens they’d bought were associated with some decentralized blockchain, without realizing that those blockchain systems sat a few degrees of separation from the centralized, compromised entity acting as their intermediary?The third piece of the puzzle is the lack of regulation, which opens a path to fixing this mess.The absence of regulations curtailing the purse-string-controlling power of entities such as FTX tends to amplify the risks generated by these illusions of invulnerability.Even if they intuitively understand how fractional reserve banking operates, people tend to think about their money in a bank account as being literally their dollars. The same goes for the amounts expressed in a third-party hosted crypto wallet. In both cases, the premise is false because customers’ funds and assets are commingled, not segregated; banks and centralized exchanges are debtors to their customers, not one-for-one custodians.At least with a bank, the customer is protected by federal deposit insurance under regulatory requirements. A depositor with an under-regulated crypto exchange is really just an unsecured creditor with no recourse if the entity has used those collective assets to invest in outside projects whose value has evaporated. What makes them vulnerable to exploitation, then, is that they live under the illusion that their money is protected when it is not.Watch: Bahamas Securities Regulator Says It Ordered FTX Crypto Transferred to Government WalletsDoes this mean the solution lies in tougher, globally universal regulations that compel centralized exchanges to ring-fence and protect their customers’ funds and for their controlling entities to be subject to strict audits? Maybe. But my point is not that governments are necessarily the answer but that some form of governance – be that a national regulator or an industry-wide self-regulatory system – is required to force the likes of FTX to protect their users.Here we can take lessons from another king of history: England’s George III, the monarch who lost the American colonies and who then proceeded to go stark raving mad. The United States’ founders saw the human fallibility problem so clearly that, after some trial and error, they created a system to guard against it. The U.S. constitution, with its “checks and balances,” is one of the great decentralizing protocols of history.The challenge then, for crypto, is not to figure out the best governance practices for each Layer 1 blockchain protocol, but to find the right framework of overarching governance for all the other human-led members of the surrounding ecosystem: the exchanges, the market-makers, the trading desks, the custodians, the wallet providers and so forth. Should it all be the government’s responsibility? Or is there a self-regulatory, industry-wide solution?Whatever the fix, its protections should be founded on the famous maxim from Lord Acton upon which any functioning democracy is founded: “power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”",2022/11/18
352,"Accounting and tax compliance in crypto is much more complicated for institutions, such as funds, exchanges and prime brokerages, due to the volume of transactions that require record-keeping. Failing to file taxes properly can result in substantial fines and, in some cases, audits.These high financial stakes combined with the difficulty of tracking so much complex transaction data has kept many institutions out of crypto to date. Understanding tax requirements and implementing programmatic record-keeping can be a good starting point for institutions to demystify crypto tax laws and reap the rewards of participating in this fast-growing ecosystem.Shawn Douglass is co-founder and CEO of Amberdata. This article is part of Tax Week.With the inception of crypto marked by the publication of the bitcoin white paper in October 2008, the industry is only 14 years old. However, the historically slow pace of regulatory change is finally catching up to where the ecosystem is today, with governments like the United States, Singapore, Australia and others issuing new frameworks and guidelines for how cryptocurrencies will be taxed in their jurisdictions.In the U.S., the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) treats cryptocurrency as property, and so cryptocurrency transactions are subject to the same short-term and long-term capital gains taxes. A gain can be realized by selling cryptocurrency, trading or by purchasing an item like a car with cryptocurrency that has appreciated in value since the time it was originally purchased.By the same token, losses from cryptocurrency investments can be written off as deductions. Cryptocurrency is taxed as regular income if it's received as payment for providing a service or earned from mining or staking. Interest earned from lending is also treated as income.Perhaps most surprising of all, in the U.S. any movement of tokens or digital assets between wallets, centralized exchanges or individuals (without any sale or purchase taking place) is regarded as a taxable event as well.This concept is completely foreign to most traditional financial institutions, as they are not used to paying fees if they send money between bank accounts. When even the smallest details become complex to track, one starts to weigh the value proposition of engaging in the first place. Luckily, with access to the right tools and data, this complexity can be managed.These categories for how cryptocurrencies are taxed in the U.S. may sound relatively simple: pay taxes on capital gains and deduct losses while counting other forms of crypto earned as regular income. But the challenge isn't knowing how cryptocurrency transactions are taxed – it's keeping track of all transactions.In particular, financial institutions, such as exchanges, hedge funds, prime brokerages and trading desks could have millions of transactions to record, report and pay taxes on.Additionally, stakes are high for entities failing to meet their tax and accounting requirements. Failing an audit due to poor accounting practices could result in the organization having to pay back taxes and face additional large fines.The high stakes combined with the challenges of accounting for millions of transactions necessitates the implementation of programmatic software for accessing and tracking granular data. Financial institutions depend on comprehensive APIs that can be integrated into their platforms to capture every transaction nuance so that balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements and other essential accounting documentation can be quickly and easily generated.In addition to wallet balances, deposits and net worth, institutional investors are also required to account for every transaction for every wallet under management.Participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols can make tax accounting even more complex. For example, if an institution is providing liquidity on a decentralized exchange (DEX), it also needs current and historical liquidity provisioning positions (in other words an exchange's assets and liabilities), current and historical percentage of the total pool owned, fees earned, claimed and unclaimed, as well as the percentage fee provided by the pool.Institutions must also track their profits and losses while participating in DeFi. This includes marking any ""impermanent losses,"" a crypto industry term for slippage, they incur as a liquidity provider on lending platforms like Aave and Compound. This is in addition to tracking important information like a platform's net annual percentage yield (APY), current loan-to-value ratio (LTV) and total value locked (TVL), which can often change in a blink of an eye in the fast-moving world of DeFi.This comprehensive documentation is essential for financial institutions to meet all tax obligations and file correctly. Beyond tax law compliance, effective accounting also provides institutions with the benefit of better understanding their organization's tax exposure so that actions can be taken to reduce liability.Any institutional player considering getting involved in the digital asset space is well aware of the need for tax law compliance (and the consequences for failing to comply), and many would cite regulatory risk as the biggest roadblock for participating in the digital asset economy. The good news is that regulatory clarity has improved dramatically over the past couple years.See also: You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022Just last month, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published a new tax reporting framework, the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF), to offer governments clarity on how transactions conducted across borders should be treated by tax authorities.Notably, the reporting obligations include stablecoins, crypto derivatives and NFTs (non-fungible tokens), adding more layers to the record-keeping requirements institutions must undertake. This also reinforces the need for easy access and interpretation of granular data across transaction and asset types.As tax laws are clarified globally and institutions realize the treasure trove of untapped opportunities in the digital asset ecosystem, expect to see greater numbers of TradFi players take the leap into the space – a trend that will only further contribute liquidity to markets and bolster opportunities for all.",2022/11/18
353,"Silvergate Capital (SI) shares fell Friday morning in a sign that FTX’s rapid unraveling continues to rattle investors.On Thursday, Silvergate CEO Alan Lane tried to assuage investors that market volatility precipitated by FTX’s collapse would not affect the crypto banker’s business.“Suffice it to say, whether deposits are up or down, we have the liquidity and the capital ratios to support the volatility,” said Lane at the Oppenheimer Blockchain & Digital Assets Summit.But his message seemed to fall flat as the company’s stock price fell almost 10% on Friday. More broadly, shares of Silvergate Capital have nosedived 85% since last year’s crypto bull run.Hours after Lane’s remarks, crypto prime brokerage FalconX announced it would not be using Silvergate SEN Leverage, which enables institutional investors to trade any asset on-platform with leverage collateralized by bitcoin or U.S. dollars, “out of an abundance of caution.” It will also not be using the crypto banker to make wire transfers.Last Friday, Silvergate announced that it has no outstanding loans or investments to FTX and clarified that FTX is not a custodian for any of its bitcoin-collateralized SEN Leverage loans. FTX does have at least $1 billion in deposits with Silvergate, but the bank says that represents less than 10% of its total deposits from all digital asset customers.Both institutional and retail investors have been on edge since FTX’s collapse as they attempt to anticipate the effects of a third market-disrupting contagion on the crypto market and the crypto industry at large. The first two contagions were precipitated by the Terra collapse in May and Three Arrow Capital’s implosion in June, respectively.Marc Cohodes, an early critic of FTX, says FTX’s deposits with Silvergate are still a sizable percentage of the banker’s overall deposit base. On Tuesday, Cohodes told Hedgeye that he’s shorting Silvergate, noting the size of FTX’s deposits with the bank is a huge red flag.Read More: Crypto Bank Silvergate Bucks Market Rally as FTX Exposure Is Questioned",2022/11/18
354,"On Nov. 2, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison lit the match that set the FTX empire built by quixotic founder Sam Bankman-Fried on fire.Looking at financial reports dated June 30, Allison noted that FTX proprietary trading arm Alameda Research had $14.6 billion in assets on its balance sheet but that its single biggest asset was $3.66 billion of “unlocked FTT” and the third-largest “asset” was $2.16 billion more of “FTT collateral.”Nearly 40% of Alameda’s assets consisted of FTT, a coin that Bankman-Fried himself more or less invented.

Her 15-plus years of journalism experience includes roles at MarketWatch/WSJ, Forbes and American Banker. She currently produces a newsletter, The Dig, about public and pre-IPO companies.Allison wrote that the situation suggested that ties between FTX and Alameda were unusually close. The story led to a Twitter war between Bankman-Fried and his former mentor Changpeng Zhao, who leads Binance, a rival exchange, and then a call for help from Bankman-Fried to Zhao that ended in a failed bailout. FTX and its 160-plus business units all filed for bankruptcy in Delaware nine days after the CoinDesk story that started the conflagration.CoinDesk obtained the audited financial statements of West Realm Shires, also known as FTX US, and FTX Trading Ltd., the combined offshore Bahamas-based entity that includes an exchange catering to non-U.S. customers and Alameda, the proprietary trading operation.It’s not clear why FTX commissioned two different audit firms to audit its 2020 and 2021 financial statements.

Why hire two different firms rather than one to produce an opinion on consolidated results? With the benefit of hindsight, we can see it perhaps suggested that Bankman-Fried didn’t want any firm to see the whole picture.The choice of firms itself is questionable. These are two small outfits, not even on the next tier to the Big Four global audit firms – Deloitte, Ernst &Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Armanino and Prager Metis do audit a few public companies but none of the size or complexity of FTX. Because the firms are so small, the audit regulator, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), inspects them only once every three years.Prager Metis has a poor recent track record with the PCAOB (first reported by the Financial Times but publicly available here) and Armanino does, too.Read more: Dan Kuhn - They Burned Down Crypto. Now They Want a ComebackIn 2019, the PCAOB published its private comments about deficiencies in Armanino’s overall quality-control processes related to its 2018 inspection because the firm hadn't corrected the board within a year.Armanino was also the auditor for Lottery.com and issued an opinion for 2021. The lottery-sales startup reported that it had overstated its available unrestricted cash balance by $30 million and improperly recognized revenue. There was substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Armanino resigned from its audit role this past September, right before a class-action lawsuit was filed against Lottery.com's executives.Forbes had previously reported that two Big Four global audit firms were also advising FTX. What were Deloitte and PwC doing for FTX?Deloitte has made a name for itself in the crypto-friendly public company world as the go-to firm for guidance on the accounting for crypto investments and transactions. Right before its IPO in April 2021, Coinbase switched to Deloitte, which audited six months of financial information and then joined the previous auditor Grant Thornton in presenting its opinion in Coinbase’s first draft registration statement.Coinbase provides a playbook for accounting for the crypto economy. Deloitte is also works with MicroStrategy – a software company known for its large bitcoin investments – to advise the company on its crypto accounting, despite not being its audit firm. That firm is KPMG.CoinDesk also has evidence, based on PwC’s own internal systems, that PwC had taken steps to limit its services for FTX US to only those allowed for auditors of public companies. Its Washington, D.C.,  office posted restrictions for any PwC office seeking business with FTX, limiting the firm’s activities with FTX US in the way that is required for an auditor to be independent under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.Perhaps PwC was helping FTX keep its tax bill at zero given its myriad investments and complex global structure. PwC is one of two preeminent Big Four firms (the other is EY) that provides most of the tax lobbying and strategic tax advice to global firms.Audit firms have interpreted Sarbanes-Oxley as giving them wide latitude to provide all kinds of tax services, even to audit clients. PwC and EY have continued to provide complex tax-structuring and tax-avoidance services that have been scrutinized by the Internal Revenue Service and global tax authorities, even when also signing the audit opinion.The second red flag for any reader of the 2021 audit reports is that neither the Armanino nor the Prager Metis audit reports for 2021 provides an opinion on the FTX US or FTX Trading internal controls over accounting and financial reporting.Thursday’s filing by FTX's new CEO, restructuring expert John J. Ray III, who was appointed after the FTX bankruptcy filing, confirms what reading the year-end 2021 financial statements should have screamed to any auditor or reader of the reports: There were no controls.“Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as I occurred here,” he wrote.“From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.”(Ray was similarly appointed after the collapse of Enron in 2001.)Because FTX is a private company, audits weren't required unless an investor or bank asked for them or if FTX was considering an IPO. That's not to mention that Dodd Frank and the subsequent Jobs Act have chipped away at the protections for investors created by the Sarbanes-Oxley to make internal controls opinions rarer even for companies that do go public.Sarbanes-Oxley, which was passed after the Enron-era scandals, requires auditors to provide an opinion on the company’s internal controls over financial reporting and for management to provide an assessment of disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting.FTX, however, was large enough based on its revenue – combined revenue for its U.S. and offshore entities for 2021 according to the audit was $1.08 billion – and its potential market capitalization, to not fall under a Jobs Act exemption that relieves companies from providing an auditor’s report on internal controls, even after they have had an IPO.Both audit firms wrote that their role is to, “Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of [West Realm Shires lnc.'s and FTX Trading Ltd. and subsidiaries'] internal control.”However, in both cases, “no such opinion [on internal controls over financial reporting] is expressed.”The third red flag is, despite a combination of enormous siphoning off of firm assets by related parties and favorable tax planning, neither FTX Trading nor FTX US paid any federal income taxes, although they both appeared to be profitable. FTX Trading's GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income was $386.5 million in 2021 and $16.7 million in 2020. FTX US reportedly lost $66.7 million on a GAAP basis in 2021, according to the Armanino audited financial statements. The U.S. firm’s activity in 2020 was negligible.The biggest red flag for preparers and readers of the audited financial statements should have been the number of complex, roundtrip and utterly confounding related-party transactions documented in just these two years. The related-party transactions at FTX Trading are so numerous that it is difficult to know where to begin to analyze them.The following are the red flags related to transactions between FTX Trading and a control person such as Bankman-Fried, who was acting outside of his role as owner/control person at FTX. The related-party transactions between FTX US and FTX Trading (Alameda and the offshore exchange) appear to be limited as of last Dec. 31.There are numerous related-party transactions documented for FTX Trading. The footnotes to the financial statements also notably say that the trading and exchange arms also have operations in the U.S. FTX Trading audit firm Prager Metis describes the scope of this set of financial statements and its audit of them as such:FTX Trading Ltd. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries referred to herein as ""the Company,"" ""the Exchange,"" or ""FTX"") was incorporated in Antigua in 2019. The company operates globally, primarily in the Bahamas, which is the company's headquarters and Antigua, while also maintaining operations in the U.S., Switzerland, Turkey and Australia.The first related-party activity relates to the role of individuals as liquidity providers, market makers and traders of the firm. Bankman-Fried and other insiders were trading on their own exchange for their own accounts.Certain related-party entities were the initial liquidity providers and participated in a majority of the market-making transactions at the inception of the exchange. Over time, other liquidity providers joined the exchange, and the percentage of trades involving related parties has decreased as a percentage of total revenue. The related entities do trade for their own proprietary purposes on non-market making transactions.Liquidity provider, market making and trading exchange transactions with a related party represented about 6% and 11 % of total exchange transaction volume for the years ended Dec. 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Because the related parties were primarily market makers, which therefore generated negative commissions, net revenues (negative) for the years end December 31, 2021 and 2020 were -$22 million and -$13.4 million, respectively, which represented about 2.2% and 14.9% of total exchange transaction revenue on an absolute basis.Another related-party transaction that has already been reported elsewhere is the exchange software royalty FTX paid to Bankman-Fried.The exchange software royalty was developed by entities and parties that are significant shareholders. The exchange software was licensed from a related entity for a fee of about 25% of net exchange transaction revenue, depending on the revenue mix. The company has licensed the rights to the software code and the rights to further develop the technology.The audited financial statements say that software royalties paid to Bankman-Fried for the years ended Dec. 31, 2021 and 2020 were $250.4 million and $22.7 million, respectively. The royalties were calculated based on 33% of net FTX exchange trading revenue, 10% of net additions to the insurance fund and 5% of net fees earned from other uses of FTX platform.This transaction is reminiscent of the web of related-party transactions orchestrated by WeWork's co-founder Adam Neumann. For example, the startup purchased the trademark on the name ""We"" from him for $5.9 million.Another highly unusual and perilous related party activity was the use of related parties to manage FTX currency and treasury activities on an “outsourced” basis.Certain related parties have provided currency and treasury management activities to the company. Those services include that the related entities serve as conduits of fiat, or crypto transactions, maintaining an intercompany account for and on behalf of the company that is repayable on demand, and the provision of the same day conversion of revenue and expense transactions of crypto to U.S. dollars, all at the company's direction. A significant percentage of the company's bill-paying activities have been facilitated through these related-party service transactions.The FTX Trading audit report says that these currency management transactions were made up of a significant portion of the customer fiat transactions and expense payments to vendors in both fiat and crypto transactions.Another massive red flag, in line with Allison’s reporting about the dependence on the home-grown FTT token on Alameda’s balance sheet, is the use of the FTX FTT token as currency for acquisitions.As notable crypto startups like BlockFi and Voyager Digital ran into financial troubles in the last year, Bankman-Fried often stepped in as a white knight. Bankman-Fried swept up Blockfolio, a trading app, reportedly for $150 million, in October 2021. Here is the FTX Trading/Prager Metis audit report language related to that last transaction:The FTT receivable and liability are marked to market based on the quoted price for the FTT tokens at the reporting date. As of Dec. 31, 202 l and 2020, the receivable was $496.8 million and $44.6 million respectively, and is presented as ""receivable, related party"" in the shareholders' equity section on the consolidated balance sheets.Related parties entered into an FTX equity-for-FTT crypto option agreement. On Oct. 15, 2020, FTX agreed to purchase 52% of Blockfolio's shares outstanding for $83.6 million, but $78.7 million of this price was to be paid using FTT tokens. It’s in this footnote that we learn that “FTT was created by a related party to tokenize the royalty payments for the trading exchange technology platform licensed to FTX.” Why is that important?FTX entered into an option with “a related party,” presumably Bankman-Fried, with the right to issue 32.5 million of the company's common shares and $1 million in exchange for 20 million FTT tokens to be delivered to Blockfolio’s selling shareholders on behalf of FTX. FTX immediately exercised the option and expected Bankman-Fried to send the tokens to Blockfolio.FTT tokens were created by Bankman-Fried to “tokenize” the royalty payments paid to him by FTX Trading for the exchange software he created. FTX offloaded its obligation to Bankman-Fried to pay off Blockfolio in FTT tokens – tokens he created to “tokenize” the royalty payments he received from FTX for the exchange software – and he got more FTX shares in return. What happens to this obligation now that FTT tokens are worthless?In the next transaction, it seems someone may have had impeccable timing in taking a receivable off the FTX books and benefitting personally. It is difficult to describe how insane and beyond the pale this transaction is from a fraud-risk and conflicts-of-interest perspective.In 2019, FTX issued 96.5 million Series A preferred shares in exchange for 1 million cryptographic BNB tokens issued by FTX rival Binance. The BNB tokens were subsequently loaned to a related party and were presented as ""BNB receivable, related party"" in FTX Trading's balance sheets as of Dec. 31, 2020. In February 202l, a related party purchased the BNB receivable for about $130.1 million.Binance’s BNB tokens would have been a good token to have on FTX's balance sheet now. At current prices, 1 million BNB tokens would be worth $270.5 million. The FTX Series A preferred shares were issued against BNB (Binance) tokens that traded at $13 to $14 at the end of 2020, but, again, a related party purchased the BNB receivable in February 2021 for about $130.1 million.The price of BNB tokens jumped significantly between Jan. 29, 2021 and Feb. 19, 2021 to $257.50 from about $44. If the related party bought before the jump in price, it got a huge bargain on the tokens. At $257.50, the related party overpaid.There’s another transaction that seems to have muddied the waters between the personal interests and professional responsibilities of key executives. In October 2021, a related party sold 12.8 million of the company's common shares to external investors in a secondary sale transaction for $301.8 million. The proceeds of the secondary sale were retained by FTX on behalf of the related party for operational expediency, and $301.8 million was included in “related party payable” on the consolidated balance sheets as of Dec. 31, 2021.This $301.8 million may be the next real fiat cash that company top executives grabbed in a hurry on Nov. 11 as it belonged to one of them, according to the audit report.On the other hand, Ray, the new FTX CEO, now says, according to a Bloomberg report of Thursday’s filing with the court, that the FTX audited financial statements shouldn't be trusted. “Advisors are working to rebuild balance sheets for FTX entities from the bottom up,"" he said.",2022/11/18
355,"Hong Kong-based crypto services firm Genesis Block said on Friday it would cease over-the-counter (OTC) trading services in wake of contagion risks from the now-bankrupt FTX exchange, according to a Reuters report.Genesis Block Trading is unrelated to Genesis Global Capital, which is owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG). DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.""We have ceased trading, as we don't know which counterparties would fail next, so we would rather close out all our positions to regain some of our liquidity,"" Genesis Block Chief Executive Wincent Hung told Reuters this week.OTC trading, also known as off-exchange trading, is done directly between two parties, without the supervision of an exchange.Genesis Block also asked customers to withdraw their funds and the company will not accept new customers. It was once Asia's biggest bitcoin (BTC) ATM operator.A Genesis Block official was previously a director in FTX Hong Kong but resigned from the directorship this month.

356,"Emurgo, the official commercial arm and a founding entity of the Cardano blockchain, plans to launch USDA, a U.S.-pegged stablecoin, in early 2023, the company told CoinDesk.USDA will be the first fully fiat-backed, regulatory-compliant stablecoin in the Cardano ecosystem.“The introduction of a fully fiat-backed, regulatory-compliant stablecoin is the next step in realizing the future for our community,” wrote Emurgo Fintech Managing Director Vineeth Bhuvanagiri in a note to CoinDesk.Stablecoins are tokens backed by an asset, or a basket of assets, and pegged to fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar. They serve as an entryway to the crypto market for traditional market participants and are extensively used within the ecosystem as instruments for trading, borrowing and lending.USDA is part of Emurgo’s Anzens product, a broader plan that would offer users several financial services and products functioning on Cardano-based assets. These plans include lending and borrowing services, crypto-based card payments and bridges between traditional markets and decentralized applications (dapps).This could help bolster Cardano’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which locks just over $53 million in value as of Friday, per DeFiLlama data. That’s an 82% slide since March highs of over $300 million.USDA is expected to launch on the Anzens platform in Q1 2023 where users will be able to tokenize their USD into USDA via credit/debit cards, wire transfer or conversion of Cardano's native ADA token, Emurgo said.Emurgo has partnered with a regulated financial services company based in the United States as the banking partner to issue USDA, ensuring the stablecoin is fully compliant and adheres to regulatory guidelines, Emurgo said, without naming the company.Alongside the tokenization of USD, Emurgo will soon enable the conversion of other stablecoins, such as USD Coin (USDC) and tether (USDT) to USDA, with long-term plans to enable conversion and swaps of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies.The move comes months after Emurgo told CoinDesk on the sidelines of Singapore’s Token2049 conference that it would invest some $200 million in the Cardano ecosystem in the coming months to increase network participation.",2022/11/18

Ray had some thoughts on his predecessor, the embattled crypto exchange's founder Sam Bankman-Fried, in a Delaware court filing.Ray, who helped preside over energy company Enron's high-profile bankruptcy two decades ago, brutally noted that FTX was less professionally run than a neighborhood lemonade stand.""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,"" Ray said in a court document filed on Thursday."" From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.""Bitcoin took the news in stride, trading sideways for most of the day, even as additional revelations surfaced from documents connected to FTX's filing for bankruptcy protection. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was up 1.1% and changing hands easily over the $16,000 support it assumed nine days ago. Ether was changing hands just over its most recent $1,200 support, off roughly a half-percentage point. Other cryptos were flat, some a bit green and others in the red, although Voyager Digital's VGX token soared more than 48% after CoinDesk's scoopmeister Ian Allison reported that crypto exchange Binance was preparing a bid for the bankrupt lending platform.Equity markets remained largely oblivious to crypto’s cascading crises with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all falling a few fractions of a percentage point. Stocks and cryptos correlation on Thursday offered a veering from recent weeks when the two asset classes showed increasing independence from one another.In an email to CoinDesk, Jon Campagna, head of trading and capital markets at crypto investment fund CoinFund, said he was ""embarrassed"" and ""saddened"" by FTX's collapse. One of CoinFund's funds made a small equity investment in FTX, Campagna said.""I have a burning rage I can’t quite extinguish,"" he wrote. ""It hurt to look at the faces of my teammates and partners this week and last. To look at the faces of my competitors and peers as we tried to help each other navigate the turmoil.""Campagna noted one company founder who worked 20 hours a day for two years who kept his company's treasury, from which he paid his employees, on FTX – and it was now gone, along with his ability to pay his employees.""""Seeing these faces and hearing these stories filled me with sadness and rage. Sadness that I could've done more to prevent these types of outcomes and rage at the petulant children that created this particular mess. I think the market is reflecting its participants feeling similar sentiments to mine.""But he added: ""This will pass. And we will build back better and stronger.""By Sam ReynoldsNew FTX CEO John J. Ray III, who was brought in to oversee Enron’s high-profile bankruptcy in 2001, didn’t hold back in his appraisal of FTX and its then-CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried.""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,"" Ray wrote in a filing to Delaware court. ""From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.""Ray’s brutal comments offered a stunning rebuke to venture capitalists who invested tens of millions of dollars in FTX after allegedly performing the most exacting due diligence, and others who treated Sam Bankman-Fried and his crypto exchange as white knights in an industry filled with scoundrels.Here are some highlights from Ray’s report:Now, let’s contrast this with recent statements from venture capitalists who, because of the irresponsibilities at FTX, have now written down their investments to zero.From Temasek, Singapore’s state-owned venture capital fund:And here’s what Sequoia had to say:But what exactly did these firms do during the due diligence process?Is it that Bankman-Fried and friends were able to construct a Potemkin village and show investors an alternate reality? Or is it just that his cult of personality is so great that the siren song of promised returns distracted these professionals from their work?Regardless, Ray and his team have uncovered more holes in a week than companies who explore investments for a living found in months of research.Through poor accounting, corporate loopholes and other accounting methods, Enron cloaked billions of dollars in debt. Its bankruptcy at the time was the largest in U.S. history.Notably, Ray led shareholder lawsuits against banks that worked with Enron’s leadership to help prop up its ruse.  Eleven banks paid Enron’s creditors around $3.4 billion; Citi paid nearly $1.7 billion. Banks, after all, were part of the problem with Enron. They created, and enabled, the Potemkin village of Enron’s financial vehicles.Substitute venture capitalists for banks, and the story sounds familiar.Texas Blockchain Summit 3:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:00 UTC) GBP Retail Sales (MoM/Oct)4:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(8:30 UTC) ECB's President Lagarde SpeechIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Binance to Relaunch Bid for Bankrupt Voyager: Source; Bitcoin Holds Above $16K Amid FTX FalloutBinance.US, the American arm of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, is preparing to bid for bankrupt lending platform Voyager Digital, according to a CoinDesk source.

359,"With investor confidence in cryptocurrencies ebbing as a result of the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange, the total market capitalization of digital assets has fallen this month below $800 billion, a level not seen since early 2021, according to data from TradingView.The latest wave of turmoil in digital-asset markets shaved some $183 billion from the industry market cap. The figure dropped to $736 billion on Nov. 9, the lowest since January 2021.The decline came as the FTX drama sent prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into a fresh tailspin. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, fell 22% during the seven days through Nov. 13, its worst weekly performance in five months.Bitcoin now makes up $319 billion worth of the entire cryptocurrency market's capitalization. At the peak of the bull market about a year ago, when bitcoin reached its all-time high around $69,000, its market value was north of $1 trillion.The entire crypto market capitalization hit the $3 trillion mark then but has been declining since.The price of bitcoin is down 5% over the last seven days and has been trading in a range of $15,000-$17,000.During previous market crashes the total market cap of the cryptocurrencies also lost considerable ground.

360,"Funding rates have turned positive for bitcoin in an early, albeit hopeful sign that market sentiment is shifting positive. As an analyst, it would be improper, and even irresponsible to suggest that this marks anything remotely close to a bottom.The starting point for investment decisions should center on risk management…and then risk management again. Institutional investors’ actions embody this strategy as many have remained on the sidelines during recent weeks' turmoil.The looming uncertainty that other crypto entities will soon be in distress, only adds to the motivation to wait. As some groups must liquidate BTC and ETH, the cost basis for both will only improve.What is arguably the worst event in crypto market history, the collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX, may become a building block for crypto firms to succeed in the future, a sizable chorus is saying.But that event remains far off. In the interim, data will remain paramount as crypto markets wade through FTX contagion. Some data will reinforce trends but other information may counter them.The positive funding rate reflects increased demand for long positions, indicating improved investor sentiment.However, this trend should be viewed in the context of eight prior days of negative funding, and bears watching, as the sharp decline on Nov. 9 may represent an overshoot to the downside.The foundation for a potential short squeeze will have been laid, if this plays out.Yet funding rates for ETH remain negative. This is worth watching, given BTC and ETH’s strong correlation. BTC and ETH prices generally move in tandem, so any distinction between the two is noteworthy.The three-month rolling basis for BTC has moved into positive territory, a potential bullish sign. Three-month basis highlights the yield that can be earned by buying an asset in the spot market, and selling it in the futures market. Still, the 0.307% spread leaves little to be desired.The three-month basis being previously negative implies bearish sentiment and may continue, which should be concerning for investors. . There’s certainly no guarantee that this will not continue. The primary message is the directional change.Basis for ETH has also moved into positive territory, with a healthier 5.4% spread between spot and futures markets.A look at options open interest by strike price shows increased put buying at the $16,000 strike price and lower. For ETH a spike in put option buying is building at the $1,100 strike price. As a put option represents the right but not the obligation to sell an asset, the activity at lower strike prices is to be understood.As confidence builds we should see less downside protection at lower levels.

BTC dropped below its previous $19,000 support as the first threads of Sam Bankman Fried’s FTX empire began unraveling.(Genesis owner Digital Currency Group (DCG) is also the parent company of CoinDesk.)Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Thursday email that markets have already “priced in” the latest news.“It might take another downfall of a major crypto company or a de-risking movement on Wall Street to take bitcoin below its recent low,” he wrote.Last week’s slower-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation date for October also “partially softened the fall” in the BTC market, Serhii Zhdanov, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange EXMO told CoinDesk, although a quick recovery of the market is “not foreseen for the nearest future.”The CoinDesk Market Index recently dropped 0.6%. Ether (ETH) was down 0.3% to $1,210 at the time of publication.Liquidity crisisFTX-Alameda’s fallout has spurred a larger drop in crypto liquidity over the past week than in any previous market drawdown, according to a report by crypto data firm Kaiko. Many market makers must operate with “delta-neutral strategies,” according to Eliézer Ndinga, director of research at crypto investment products firm 21.co.“They have to go long on specific products but also possibly go short to make sure that they can hedge against a specific downside,” Ndinga told CoinDesk in an interview.Genesis’ had $8.4 billion in loan originations and $2.8 million in total active loans at the end of the third quarter, according to its website.“This is bigger than many people think,” Ndinga said, adding:“I think the best-case scenario for players like Genesis would be to find fresh capital or more of the highest bidders to help the company to operate better.”“We're going to hear more about the effects on these players in the space,” he said.",2022/11/17
363,"Arkon Energy, the data center startup that uses renewable electricity to mine bitcoin (BTC), raised $28 million, led by quantitative investment manager and digital assets market maker, Blue Sky Capital.The financing was a combination of senior debt and equity capital and included some returning investors such as Kestrel 0x1 as well as new ones, including Shima Capital, the company said in a statement. The startup has also bought Hydrokraft AS, a renewable energy-based data center in Norway, without disclosing the terms of the deal.""The Hydrokraft purchase is part of an ambitious plan to create a vertically integrated green bitcoin mining platform that has power sovereignty, benefits from geographic diversification, and a robust balance sheet,"" according to the statement.Hydrokraft's data centers are powered completely by hydro electricity and have an operating capacity of 30 megawatts (MW) which can be expanded to 60MW, Arkon said in the statement. The startup plans to immediately begin work to build out incremental infrastructure to utilize the facility’s full capacity.The funding comes as the bitcoin mining industry has been in survival mode during the crypto bear market – dealing with not just falling prices, but also surging energy costs – leading to bankruptcies and a plunge in share prices for publicly traded companies. However, in recent months, mining companies that have access to low cost energy and more innovative business models are getting financed by investors.Most recently, a new solar-powered bitcoin miner, Aspen Creek Digital Corp. (ACDC), raised $8 million in Series A funding and Vespene Energy, a company that converts methane gas released from landfills into power for bitcoin mining, closed a $4.3 million funding round.""In a period in which the largest bitcoin miners in the world are struggling with high costs and over-leveraged balance sheets, the ability of Arkon Energy to attract capital highlights its unique value proposition,"" said Barry Kupferberg, Managing Partner of Barkers Point Capital Advisors which helped Arkon finance the deal.Arkon was founded in 2019 and is headed by CEO Josh Payne, who is also co-founder and chief operating officer of Battery Future Acquisition Corp. (BFAC), a NYSE-listed special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC). As part of the new funding round, partners from Blue Sky, Kestrel 0x1, and Barkers Point Capital Advisors will be joining the startup's board.

365,"Crypto exchange FTX collapsed spectacularly into bankruptcy last week as trust in its accounting for billions of dollars in assets vanished.In the fiery aftermath, some critics are blasting the very existence of centralized exchanges like Sam Bankman-Fried’s, saying they haven’t been reliable stewards for customers’ assets.But the blowup has reinvigorated the discussion about a potential solution, something called ""proof of reserves,"" or PoR, a way of showing – with little or no doubt – exactly how many tokens are at any exchange that adopts the technique. If in place at FTX, proof of reserves could have in theory prevented customers’ money from being moved where it shouldn’t have been (to Bankman-Fried’s trading firm Alameda Research).Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, has already shared its wallet balances and says it plans to conduct a proof-of-reserves snapshot “in the next few weeks.” Other exchanges that have made similar commitments include Gate.io, KuCoin, Poloniex, Bitget, Huobi, OKX, Deribit and Bybit.Read more: Indian Crypto Exchange Giottus Says It Will Provide Proof of Reserves, While Rivals Remain SilentProof of reserves is an auditing technique used to confirm assets on hand. Stablecoin issuers like Paxos use it to prove they have sufficient assets backing their tokens, while exchanges like BitMEX use it to prove customer deposits correspond to assets in custody.“It would have been a pretty solvable problem if there was more transparency on the balance sheet. We already power multiple stablecoins and multiple gold coins and multiple financial institutions, where we prove their balance sheets through proof of reserves,” Sergey Nazarov told CoinDesk in an interview. Nazarov is the co-founder of oracle network Chainlink, which offers a proof-of-reserves product.There are several ways for an entity to prove its asset reserves, from traditional third-party audits by companies like Armanino to ""Merkle tree proofs"" (cryptographic verification via data structures called Merkle trees).Read more: Proof of Reserves: Could It Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown?Then there are methods employed by blockchain analytics companies. Chainlink, for example, separates proof-of-reserves implementation into two categories: off-chain and on-chain.The off-chain alternative involves a third-party provider like Chainlink receiving API (application programming interface) access from an exchange, its custodian or its auditor to independently verify the exchange’s holdings.The on-chain route involves a proof-of-reserves smart contract on one network (usually Ethereum) that receives data feeds (on a block-by-block basis) from Chainlink’s oracle network about a provider’s on-chain wallet balances on another network (e.g., Bitcoin).Either way, the result is users can verify a company is actually holding the assets it claims to be holding.Eric Richmond is a corporate and securities lawyer turned crypto entrepreneur. He founded and ran Tetra Trust, Canada’s first licensed digital-asset custodian in 2019. He is now the chief operating officer at Coinsquare, one of Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges.Read more: Canadian Digital Asset Brokerages Coinsquare and CoinSmart to MergeCoinsquare is a registered investment dealer that reports to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC), a self-regulated collection of more than 170 dealers similar to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra) in the U.S. Richmond believes while proof of reserves is a step in the right direction, regulation might be a better solution.“We have an obligation to run daily reports to view our client liabilities versus assets in cold storage,” Richmond explained. “Every single day, we ensure one-to-one in cold storage, which is a requirement of ours under IIROC registration.”Cold storage means keeping assets offline, not connected to the internet.Other experts like Nic Carter believe proof of reserves is “the industry’s last hope in terms of making a strong self-regulatory commitment.” Carter is a general partner at Castle Island Ventures, a firm that invests in crypto financial infrastructure.“Lord knows we need to represent to regulators that we are capable of self-regulation, especially after FTX shattered confidence like this,” Carter told CoinDesk.“PoR would inhibit situations like Quadriga, FTX or Gox. If any exchange now refuses to do one, I should expect that people will be extremely skeptical of them,"" he said.In the 2019 collapse of QuadrigaCX, Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchange at the time, it was later revealed its late founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten, had misappropriated and misused client funds, leaving only a fraction of value behind for its creditors to claim. In the 2014 implosion of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, poor security practices and questionable fund activity resulted in a massive hack. Creditors are still fighting to regain some of those lost funds. The downfall of those platforms, like the collapse of FTX, forced the industry to consider significant improvements to fund and custody management.Peter Eberle, president and chief investment officer of Castle Funds, a cryptocurrency-focused investment firm, echoed Carter’s comments.""I believe this will force exchanges to be more transparent. They will need to prove that they are not commingling funds and that they are not lending out customer assets. They will have to earn trust from customers that they actually have the assets that they say they do,” Eberle told CoinDesk. “Audited financial statements, proof of reserves, will be standard going forward. This is something that should always have been the case, but wasn't.""Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin, one of the largest global cryptocurrency exchanges, also agrees the industry needs more transparency. He says his organization has already started to provide attestations.“This is a matter of self-regulation within the entire industry. In terms of our next steps, we'll look at our internal data, and then find out what kind of data can really reassure our users. And then we'll work with the third parties to disclose data as needed,” Lyu told CoinDesk in an interview. “So far, we've already disclosed information for the bigger and more influential tokens, including ethereum and BTC.”Read more: Let’s Actually Commit to Proofs of Reserve This Time, Okay?",2022/11/17
366,"Something often said about the crypto community is that it’s full of libertarian tax cheats. The stereotype doesn’t come from nowhere – crypto does have its roots in crypto-anarchist ideology. And many of our favorite stories often involve “sovereign individuals” and “oppressive regimes,” even though those fables are distorted into antagonistic media narratives about the industry.Today’s community looks vastly different than it did even a few years ago, let alone when cypherpunk coder Satoshi Nakamoto first invented Bitcoin. The contemporary crypto scene is diverse – full of financial, artistic, ideological and technical blockchain users – and frankly, only a minority are crusaders against taxation.Richa Joshi is co-founder of Push Protocol. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.So why does this narrative persist? The answer is more nuanced than stubborn resistance.There are people who dislike or are confused by contemporary tax rules around crypto – including regulations that make buying coffee with BTC a taxable event and airdrops a form of income.Still, by and large, the crypto community does not want to evade or avoid taxes – they just want clear and commonsense rules. The vast majority of crypto users are citizens who wish to pay their dues to their communities, their cities and their government. (Crypto, afterall, is about collaboration – and nation states are pretty big communities.)However, despite year-over-year efforts to clarify crypto tax filing, regulatory agencies have failed to keep pace with technical innovation in Web3. (This doesn’t include rules that make sense, like capital gains paid after buying a token for x and selling it for 2x, which has a direct analogue to traditional finance.)Read more: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022 Things get complicated when considering how crypto is meant to function, and how it differs from anything that came before. Take gas fees, or the price you pay to run computation on a blockchain like Ethereum, which could be treated as traditional portfolio management fees or possibly discounted from capital gains. Further, many DeFi mechanisms – like flash loans! – have limited or no equivalents in traditional finance.This scale of differentiation between crypto financial mechanisms and traditional ones is felt primarily by individuals filing their taxes, who are burdened both with submitting their taxes without clear guidelines and with the potential downfall of getting them wrong.Even well-meaning actors may end up feeling unsupported or scrutinized by regulators, and that tension results in the kinds of anti-tax conversations heard on Crypto Twitter. When people in crypto criticize taxes, they do so less out of ideological grandstanding and more out of simple frustration with a system that appears to ignore a technology that is growing in size, profitability and significance.Read more: The Case for Taxing Proof-of-Work / OpinionThey’re commenting on the tension between filer and regulator, which emerges when authorities appear to ignore the nuances of the rules they’re writing or how that affects what you can do with a blockchain.Take, for example, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s recent suggestion that unrealized gains should be taxed – any crypto trader who has experienced a bull market will recognize the consequences of being left with such a tax! Many people were rich on paper in 2021, and wiped out today, for instance.Read more: How Web 3 Could Change Tax CollectionAs Web3 grows and encroaches on nearly every industry in some way or another, the need for renewed crypto tax regulation will become clear. If this technology is broadly accepted, to the point where most don’t even recognize that they’re interacting with a blockchain, having less stringent rules will become necessary, not a preference, as we can’t have people incurring capital gains taxes without even knowing it.Crypto users don’t want to live off the grid and outside of the reach of the government. Overwhelmingly, they want to be active members of their communities helping others build, grow and create.",2022/11/17

Under PoW, Ethereum was powered by miners, which competed to solve cryptographic puzzles to add transactions to the digital ledger. Under PoS, Ethereum uses validators to approve and add blocks to the blockchain, which burns less energy. Since the Merge, Ethereum has reduced its energy consumption by 99.9%.“The Merge set a new and extremely high bar for climate mitigation across the entire business and financial sector. It demonstrated that through sheer force of collective will, we can successfully drive technological decisions that massively reduce carbon output,” Lubin was quoted in a press release.Mining has received backlash from regulators due to its environmental harm. The European Commission shared in October that it was prepared to shut down crypto mining in the event that Europe faces a dire energy crisis this winter. In addition, regulatory bodies such as the European Union have proposed to limit PoW in the EU. China banned Bitcoin mining in 2021.Some PoW chains, like ZCash and Dogecoin, have shared that they are looking to switch to PoS because of energy concerns.Read more: EU Countries Must Be Ready to Block Crypto Mining, Commission SaysUPDATE (Nov. 17, 13:30 UTC): Added ""co-launching"" in 1st paragraphUPDATE (Nov. 17, 13:44 UTC): Added ""co-launches"" in title",2022/11/17

369,"German banks have seen limited interest in handling crypto, the President of Germany’s financial regulator Bafin, said in an interview published Thursday, adding that financial innovation attracted “freeloaders and crooks.”German is one of the first countries to require banks to hold a license to deal in crypto, but Mark Branson, who also sits on the board of the supervision arm at the European Central Bank (ECB), said it has only issued four licenses for crypto custody and 14 provisional permits.“Overall, banks’ interest in offering crypto-asset trading to their customers still seems, to me, to be limited,” Branson said in an interview posted on the ECB website, saying that blockchain technology needs to move from being merely “promising” to being “effective and scaleable.”“Not all crypto business models are serious,” he added. “Waves of innovation, as we know, also bring with them freeloaders and crooks.”Rather than slowing innovation, regulation should be well balanced and flexible to allow sophisticated projects to emerge and reduce financial stability risks, he said.By some accounts Germany is the world’s most crypto-friendly jurisdiction, largely because of tax rules, and major lenders such as Commerzbank are among those who applied for licenses.But the regulator is also prepared to get tough. BaFin recently ordered crypto exchange Coinbase to remedy organizational shortcomings revealed during an audit, and crypto companies there will soon be subject to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA).

Soon after, Sun announced a similar plan, mimicking Bukele's accumulation strategy.The strategy of purchasing bitcoin on a set schedule instead in reaction to market movements is known as dollar cost averaging (DCA). The advantage of DCA is that it removes the emotional component of decision-making and you end up paying less in dollar terms for the investment over the long run than you would spend while timing the market.Bukele and Sun's decision to employ the DCA strategy comes as the recent collapse of Sam Bankman Fried's cryptocurrency exchange FTX threatens to prolong the crypto bear market.

Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,200, a 3.7% decline. Other major altcoins were largely in the red with CEL and UNI both off more than 5%. FTX’s FTT token declined nearly 4% and was trading at just $1.66, far removed from its high near $36 earlier in the year.Genesis Interim CEO Derar Islim told customers on a call that Genesis is exploring solutions for the lending unit, including finding a source of fresh liquidity. He said Genesis intends to detail its plan to clients next week. Genesis Global Capital serves an institutional client base and had $2.8 billion in total active loans as of the end of the third quarter of 2022, according to the company’s website.

What's Next for the Crypto Industry?By Shaurya MalwaCrypto markets have a way of ignoring time.Some weeks pass with markets and technical developments moving slower than a snail’s leisurely walk.Then there are days that pack months – or arguably years’ – worth of action into a few hours. The recent collapse of crypto exchange FTX and spreading fallout belongs to the latter category. In a few days, one of crypto’s flagship enterprises has evaporated, and contagion has gripped markets swept up in new doubts about the industry’s stability.Crypto funds and projects have lost hundreds of millions of dollars custodied on exchanges and lending companies have ceased certain operations, most recently the lending arm of crypto investment bank Genesis Global Trading, which suspended withdrawals on Wednesday. Genesis Global Capital had $2.8 billion in active loans in its recently completed third quarter, as CoinDesk reported.Genesis Global Trading CoinDesk are independent subsidiaries of the same parent firm, Digital Currency Group (DCG).In a call early Wednesday, Interim CEO Derar Islim told customers that the company’s issues related to FTX’s collapse.Islim said that Genesis is exploring solutions for the lending unit, including finding a source of fresh liquidity. He added Genesis intends to detail its plan to clients next week. The story now sounds like a refrain of the crypto industry’s myriad tragedies of recent months. Terraform Labs, Celsius and Three Arrows Capital all offered some vague hope of making good to customers, even as their paper walls were crumpling. What hope has Genesis Global Capital?Last week, Genesis disclosed that its derivatives unit had about $175 million in locked funds in its FTX trading account. As a result, DCG opted to strengthen Genesis’ balance sheet with an equity infusion of $140 million.The announcement was noted by Gemini, the crypto exchange and custodian that has a partnership with Genesis.""We are working with the Genesis team to help customers redeem their funds from the Earn program as quickly as possible,"" Gemini said in a statement, adding that it was “encouraged by Genesis’ and its parent company Digital Currency Group’s commitment to doing everything in their power to fulfill their obligations to customers under the Earn program.""To be sure, Genesis has not declared solvency issues. The client call implied Genesis was currently illiquid due to market conditions but not insolvent, which would mean it was unable to pay debts owed.Scant comfort.Market affect?Scores of market participants on Crypto Twitter floated theories of how Genesis’ problems would affect the market – ranging from the impact on DCG-owned investment firm Grayscale’s bitcoin and ether products to on-chain sleuths signaling trouble at crypto exchange Gemini, citing on-chain data.Some opine the search for liquidity to help Genesis may see it unwind part of its GBTC holdings, a Grayscale product that tracks bitcoin, causing prices of bitcoin to plummet to as low as $8,000.Genesis is a big player in crypto that a year ago, in what now seems the long-ago, pre-bear market past, had over $50 billion in loan originations and $12.5 billion in active loans. It traded over $31 billion in spot volume and over $21 billion in derivatives volumes. Those volumes fell last quarter, however, because of troubles at Three Arrows Capital, another once-high-flying crypto fund.Traditional finance market participants liken the ongoing crisis to historic macro events, such as Long Term Capital Management’s (LTCM) billion-dollar implosion in the early 90s and Lehman Brothers’ fall from grace in 2008.Some of these institutions may soon be caught up in the current mess.

Grayscale announced via Twitter on Wednesday that ""Genesis Global Capital is not a counterparty or service provider for any Grayscale product.""Crypto investors in the U.S. filed a class-action suit accusing Sam Bankman-Fried and the company’s host of paid celebrity promoters, including NFL quarterback Tom Brady, comedian Larry David, tennis player Naomi Osaka and NBA team the Golden State Warriors, with fraudulently promoting FTX yield-bearing account (YBAs). The plaintiffs called the FTX platform “a house of cards” and “Ponzi scheme... where the FTX Entities shuffled customer funds between their opaque affiliated entities, using new investor funds obtained through investments in the YBAs and loans to pay interest to the old ones and to attempt to maintain the appearance of liquidity.”By Glenn Williams Jr.For both BTC and ETH, the magnitude of price movement since January 2022 has been declining, when using the Average True Range of daily price movement as a proxy.A lack of price movement gives investors less opportunity to generate gains.

374,"While the recent spike in price volatility is subsiding, don’t expect institutions to re-enter crypto markets with any force just yet.These large-scale investors have been spooked by recent volatility that is difficult to predict and may send their investments spiraling downward. Bitcoin’s support has already fallen about 13% over the past 10 days amid the unraveling of crypto exchange FTX. Its recent price at about $16,500 is less than a quarter of what it was just a year ago.But this latest twist is odd given investors previous concerns about a lack of volatility that has plagued markets for months.For both BTC and ETH, the magnitude of price movement since January 2022 has been declining, when using the Average True Range of daily price movement as a proxy.A lack of price movement, gives investors less opportunity to generate gains.Now as investors focus more on avoiding calamity than producing alpha, a new trading range appears to be forming at the $16,500 level for BTC.Where previously we saw significant price agreement between the $19,000 to $20,000 range, the recent turmoil has pushed that level of agreement down.For ETH, the spikes in price agreement are appearing at both the $1,200 and $1,100 level.Institutional investors appear to still have confidence about digital assets, but also find little reason to add exposure.“Right now, most of the institutional investors we talk to are content to sit on the sidelines and just wait...they haven't sworn off the space, but they're not doing anything in crypto right now especially against this macro backdrop,” Ben McMillan, CIO of digital currency index provider IDX Digital Assets saidMcMillan said that investors are anxious about future developments that could send crypto markets further spiraling.“I think there's no question investors are waiting for the next shoe to drop...the million dollar question is ""how big is that shoe?"" he said.He added: “I've had several calls already today about Genesis halting withdrawals.

375,"Nearly every human who has ever paid a check, received a check, or waited in line at the Post Office on tax day has inevitably experienced some inner gloom regarding a certain five-lettered word: taxes. Throughout much of history, taxes have simply been a way of life. We work, play and live, and then some sort of shadowy figure (probably in a suit) takes a [insert percentage] piece of the pie.But what about crypto, you ask? Even in such a volatile, often unregulated and always chaotic ecosystem, we still must pay taxes! Like nearly all other industries, you are required to pay a percentage of your short-term and long-term capital gains, put against how long you have held assets and your income. And guess what? The same goes for NFTs too! Degens – can I get a whatthehellelujah?!Let me explain.Sidney Swift is founder and CEO of Defient. He leads Rolling Stone’s Web3 Culture Council. This piece is part of CoinDesk's tax week.Okay, first things first. The basics. Creating (a.k.a. minting) an NFT is not a taxable event. If you create an NFT (a 1:1 or a 10K-strong collection) and no one buys it or trades it, you will not be taxed. So you can rest assured that your decision to tokenize your college diploma will not affect your finances any more than your college education did. Phew! According to Uncle Sam, in the United States, any crypto-to-crypto transaction is a taxable event, including buying an NFT, trading an NFT, or selling an NFT. A handy blog from TokenTax breaks down how any gains you make on NFT trades or sales will be taxed just like any gains on your bitcoin or ether, for example. Pretty straightforward, right? Well, not necessarily. This is crypto we’re talking about, people!Coinbase explains just how confusing tax laws around NFTs can be. The IRS considers NFT transactions as two-part events, the first being the sale of the crypto you used to buy an NFT (and how much its value rose since the time you purchased it – i.e., 1 ETH from $1,000 to $4,000; ah, the good old days) and the second being any gains from the sale of said NFT. Furthermore, the IRS’ exact guidelines over what is considered a work of art (i.e., a 28% capital gains tax) are somewhat unclear. What about royalties, a buzzword of the moment in NFTs? Any royalties received via NFT sales are still taxed just like income, based on your tax bracket.See also: Key Tax Implications of NFTs, Crypto Staking and Yield Farming | OpinionSo we understand a bit of what taxes mean for NFTs, where many might initially think about digital collectibles, art, and PFPs, but what about music – and, more specifically, music NFTs?Taxation around “traditional” recorded music can also be a tad murky. The IRS splits the potential for taxation on whether you categorize your music-making as a hobby or business. Additionally, if you find yourself in a band or duo, you will have to figure out who will file a return. Self-employed musicians and their creative accounts also have an opportunity to write off everything from a guitar case to internet bills. Regardless, musicians are taxed on capital gains, income and royalties.So what does this mean for the still fresh-faced world of Web3 music, a burgeoning space of the ecosystem categorized primarily by music NFTs (a broad-ish term for tokenized songs and albums, music-focused NFT memberships, music memorabilia, and collectibles) but also things like music DAOs, decentralized labels, and avatar artists? An article in Billboard covers how musicians can legally protect themselves in Web3, especially when you start hearing words like “securities,” “copyrights” and “royalties.”The web3 music ecosystem is vast. You have royalties-focused platforms (Royal), streaming-focused platforms (Audius), collection/drops-focused platforms (Sound.xyz), DAOs (Friends with Benefits), decentralized music clubs and avatar artist projects (ChillRX), open protocols (Zora, Decent.xyz), artist tools (OxSplits) and even major labels (Warner, Death Row). The primary purpose of all these operations is to introduce music-making and music-consumption tools into Web3 communities to create alternative revenue streams for artists and fans who show their loyalty through investing in artists. Now, if you reread this last paragraph and this entire article, you should be thinking: What does this mean for the relationship between music NFTs and taxes?Read more: Tax and Compliance Challenges Enterprises Face in Crypto | OpinionIf laws around taxation are confusing for crypto and art-focused NFTs, music is a whole other can of worms. Platforms like the 3LAU-founded Royal pay streaming royalties to fans who invest in music NFTs from artists ranging from superstars (Diplo) to indie artists (Vérité). When streaming checks hit and are split between artists and labels/publishers, a percentage is then paid out to investors of the artist’s NFTs. Royal’s T&C page outlines that, yes, you are responsible for reporting any gains around your trades or sales. What’s less clear is how that differentiates around the fluctuation of the currency you bought the NFT with and whether you are taxed on the royalties payout you receive and/or your profit from a potential NFT sale. Likely, the answer is both.What do artists who mint music NFTs get to write off? How do their label and streaming contracts come into play when setting royalty rates and paying out collectors? When a virtual artist, who could be actually multiple producers, releases a track as an NFT and on Spotify, who is taxed and when? How are members of music DAOs taxed on the value of membership tokens and collective investments, like music catalogs, which are strictly tied to royalties and various tax laws? Is it all the same as regular crypto? I believe all of these questions are far too unclear and need answering.Here’s why:Taxes are something no one really ever wants to talk about, and this is especially true in Web3. For decades, classes have been taught and books have been written about the inner-workings of the music business. The world’s top music lawyers are industry icons who get profiled in year-end lists. If web music is truly going to change the world and bring power back to artists and the communities who support them, we can no longer avoid the inevitable growing elephant in the room.",2022/11/16
376,"Digital assets extended losses on Wednesday after the crypto financial firm Genesis Global Capital announced that it was temporarily suspending redemptions and new loan originations, the latest industry player to struggle in wake of crypto exchange FTX's meltdown.Bitcoin (BTC) dropped 3.5% to $16,456 during U.S. morning trading hours on Wednesday, according to CoinDesk data, erasing some of the prior day’s gains. At press time, bitcoin was changing hands at $16,473.The cryptocurrency also appeared buffeted by an economic data release showing that U.S. retail sales rose 1.3% in October, a sign that consumers are resilient going into the holiday season. That might mean the Federal Reserve will maintain its aggressive campaign to tamp down economic activity to combat inflation – typically a negative factor for risky assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies.“We don’t expect any sharp drops or selling pressure due to contagion fears alone since the bulk of the move is likely to be priced in already,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, a firm that manages crypto hedge funds. “At this point, any new development will result in temporary drops, but we don’t expect investors to be shocked by more FTX-related ramifications either. That being said, recovery from these lows may need time, both in terms of market capitalization and general sentiment.”Will Tamplin, a senior analyst at technical research firm Fairlead Strategies, said that if bitcoin can’t get back above its long-term support near $18,300 by Sunday’s weekly close, “a major breakdown would be confirmed in a bearish message from the market, which would increase risk to next support near $13,900.”The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures the performance of 162 major digital assets, lost about 1.8% over the past 24 hours.Smart-contracts platform Solana’s native SOL token slid 0.2% to around $14 after the Solana Foundation confirmed in a blog Wednesday that FTX entities are in control of around 50 million SOL tokens.The blog said the tokens were sold from Solana Foundation to FTX and Alameda Research in three transactions between August 2020 and January 2021. The second and third transactions had a linear monthly unlock mechanism, meaning that as the SOL token tranches are to be paid out evenly once a month to FTX, the entities could gradually gain access to millions of tokens up until January 2028.Aptos, the new layer 1 blockchain established by former employees of Facebook parent Meta Platforms, was one of the few winners Wednesday. The APT token was up 11% to $4.70 in recent trading.While FTX’s collapse and its ramifications for the broader crypto industry are a serious blow, it won’t scare away institutional investment from entering the market, according to Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner of Storm Partners.“General speculation and panic will continue,” Ahmed told CoinDesk, but he said that institutional investors’ “choices are more likely to be informed by how innovation and technology could benefit them.""“They will most likely rethink their short-term strategies as the market infrastructure remains unstable.”Once all the stakeholders directly and indirectly affected by the fall of FTX absorb the losses, “we could see institutions swoop in at the lows with their heavy pockets,” he added.",2022/11/16
377,"When we look back at November 2022, we may well view it as the end of the ""Centralization Era"" in crypto.Centralized crypto exchanges offered consumers an appealingly convenient way to invest in crypto. However, the centralization era also led to disregard for consumer protection and massive meltdowns that have affected tens of millions of people and hundreds of billions in assets.Consumers are learning very hard lessons about the risks of centralization. You can draw a straight historical line from Mt. Gox to Voyager Digital, Celsius Network and now FTX. The inevitable conclusion is that centralized entities pose a systemic risk to the crypto ecosystem. It is well past time that we as a collective crypto community come together to demand better.Shingo Lavine and Adam Lavine are co-founders of Ethos.io, a decentralized technology company.Crypto was founded upon the idea of true individual ownership and self-sovereignty as a response to the 2008 financial crisis. It was built to be different, where individuals held the keys to their own wallets and could trade without an intermediary.The animating vision since Bitcoin’s creation has been to enable all of us to take back control of our money. There is a longstanding truism that ""power corrupts,"" which holds for financial history, too: If you give someone control over your money, they're bound to abuse your trust. This plays out in crypto between self-custody and centralized custodians.It’s time we returned to the roots of crypto that brought us all together in the first place.Read more: How Crypto Can Do Good for the World / OpinionAt Ethos.io, we have long been proponents of decentralization and self-custody. In 2017, we designed a decentralized crypto wallet that garnered over 100,000 users, and were then tapped to help build the payment and blockchain rails for Voyager, a centralized crypto broker which scaled to a million users.In time, we left Voyager because of cultural differences – the management insisted on a centralized path to build up their AUM [assets under management]. Ultimately these funds were lent out to Three Arrows Capital, leading to a swift Voyager bankruptcy.Unfortunately, both Voyager’s and FTX’s users have learned the hard way that crypto held in accounts on those platforms are not “theirs” – far from it. Centralized exchanges and brokers often co-mingle funds into omnibus wallets, and treat their customers as “unsecured creditors.” Voyager depositors have watched management, employees, lawyers and bankers all consume company capital resources while their crypto remains locked up in the bankruptcy process.Read more: FTX Showed the Problems of Centralized Finance, and Proved the Need for DeFi / OpinionIt is mind-boggling how often just one person’s actions can impact the fortunes of millions. This is the exact opposite of how crypto is supposed to work and why the centralization era has been so risky. This era must come to an end.The era of decentralization is the only viable path forward. Crypto must return to its roots and take back power from corrupt institutions that have abused their power and influence.The last five years have seen several technical breakthroughs that can serve as a foundation for a robust, safe and fair decentralized economy. Decentralized trading platforms promise huge benefits over centralization: lack of counter-party risk, on-chain settlement and transparency. It is simply impossible to trade against your customers.A properly implemented and maintained decentralized finance (DeFi) economy will service the interest of both customers and operators, not to mention provide encoded consumer protections which regulators are trying to achieve.Read more: It Can’t Be ‘Decentralization or Bust’ / OpinionWork must still be done. Vitilak Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum, has written eloquently on the need for secure vaults to minimize the risk of losing your keys. Multi-party cryptography (MPC), layered security and social guardians can make this a reality and leave the days of mnemonics and seed phrases behind.We are once again at an inflection point where we as a community must defy centralization. We must defy corrupt CEOs who seek to separate us from our money. We must defy corporate secrecy, which has enabled corruption and recklessness paid on the customers’ dime. We must want to return to crypto’s roots and empower individuals to wrest control of what is rightfully theirs.The future will not be centralized. But we must build it.",2022/11/16

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.The fallout continued from this month’s crypto crash, with the Bahamas arm of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange filing for bankruptcy in in the U.S. and a report that the digital-asset lender BlockFi was reportedly preparing a potential bankruptcy filing because of its exposure to FTX. Online investing platform BnkToTheFuture has dropped a plan to acquire the crypto lender Salt Lending due to FTX exposure. The political backlash is growing, too. Lawmakers in Washington grilled U.S. financial regulators on Tuesday.The FTX debacle has brought deep dislocation in digital-asset markets, and analysts are racing to make sense of it all and what comes next. The art of “on-chain analysis” – the practice of extracting data from on-chain transactions and then interpreting it – is one of the first areas to get tested; historically, outflows from big crypto exchanges meant that investors were getting more bullish, moving their coins to long-term custody or storage to hold for the medium or long term. But a recent uptick in outflows might mean that investors are losing faith in the exchanges. Data also shows that crypto traders are increasingly turning to decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocols for their exchange and lending needs.It’s now been more than a week since the price of bitcoin hit a two-year low at around $15,600, and questions are invariably forming on whether the market bottom is in. The largest cryptocurrency’s price has inched back up to $16,600. Price charts suggest a drop down to $13,000 is still possible, and traders in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s bitcoin futures market appear to be piling into a big “short” trade – bets on further price declines. What’s clear from the data over the past two weeks is just how much cryptocurrencies trade in sync when there’s a big market shakeout: Check out this analysis of the correlations between CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) sectors.

380,"Depending upon whom you ask, last week’s FTX blowup feels bigger than when Mt. Gox, the original Bitcoin exchange, fell to ruin in 2014. Bigger than The DAO hack of 2016, which forced Ethereum to fork into two chains as a way to recover user funds. Bigger, too, than the implosion of Terra, the crypto stablecoin operator that went bust this past spring and brought down firms like Voyager, Celsius, and 3AC in its wake.FTX’s financial impact was smaller than some of the events. So why does it feel existential?Maybe it’s because crypto is already in the midst of a brutal bear market, making yet another blow feel heavier than it would have at the market’s peak.This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.Perhaps it’s because the key person behind the failure, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was until a week ago considered crypto’s white knight, trusted by sophisticated investors and institutions as one of the most responsible actors in the space.But, in this writer’s opinion, the real reason why FTX was such a colossal failure is not because the crypto industry was duped, but because it proved that the industry was vulnerable to being duped.This distinction, while seemingly minor, strikes at the core of what crypto is supposed to be – a foundation to build systems that are trustless. The FTX blowup and contagion are proving, yet again, that the crypto industry, if not its core technology, is currently as trust-based and corruptible as the traditional financial system that it sought to circumvent.We need to do a better job of differentiating between Crypto and the Crypto Industry.Capital-’C’ Crypto will not be killed by FTX. The core technology undergirding platforms like Ethereum and Bitcoin are still working as advertised. FTX and its sister company Alameda Research used blockchains and cryptocurrency, but they were old-fashioned companies killed by old-fashioned fraud.As for the Crypto Industry, FTX will prove cataclysmic. We can talk all we want about the sanctity of “decentralized” and “trustless” technology, but so much of the attention and money that has poured into the space over the past several years has gone toward companies like FTX, BlockFi, Celsius and Voyager – unregulated, token-based extensions of traditional finance.Sure, we always knew that these weren’t really Crypto companies, but investors, influencers and users let that distinction slide. We let these companies use their venture-backed liquidity reserves to pump up tokens and entice retail investors with promises of sky-high yields.As these companies die, so too should the insane valuations, free-money schemes and money-printing accounting practices that have come to typify the Crypto Industry.Decentralized finance (DeFi) – tools built on blockchains that allow people to trade and transact without centralized intermediaries – are pitched as a direct antidote to frauds like the one that seems to have been perpetrated by FTX.As fear continues to spread around the solvency of centralized platforms like Crypto.com, decentralized platforms like Aave and Uniswap claim to be structurally incapable of misappropriating user funds.These platforms, which require users to trust code rather than central parties, have generally proven resilient amidst the FTX turmoil.As my former CoinDesk colleague Andrew Thurman noted on Twitter, DeFi platforms have seen big boosts in activity over the past week as their centralized counterparts have been experiencing record withdraws:DeFi is just a tool. While it carries certain intrinsic advantages relative to other tools (e.g. transparency), it can be used for good or for ill.DeFi did not fall apart as a result of FTX, but this week reminded us that incumbent DeFi ecosystems are not immune to rot from the wider, oligarchical crypto ecosystem.As CoinDesk reported earlier this week, Solana’s DeFi ecosystem, already struggling amid the market downturn of the past few months, was crushed by the failure of FTX.This failure stemmed largely from the SBF-empire’s massive stake in the Solana ecosystem – not only in terms of its token holdings, but in terms of the role that FTX developers played in building out the projects at the core of the network’s DeFi ecosystem. For example, CoinDesk reported last week on Serum – a leading Solana DeFi platform that was built and maintained by FTX engineers.Though FTX couldn’t easily steal Serum funds, governance rights on the platform were basically controlled by SBF’s own developers, and the “Serum DAO” that was supposed to govern the protocol was virtually toothless when it came to making changes.Moreover, FTX and Alameda’s outsized stake in certain low-market-cap tokens granted it the theoretical ability to manipulate markets.The FTX-Solana contagion is not the only recent example of DeFi’s corruptibility. Terra, which was ostensibly decentralized, has been accused of using venture money to rope in retail investors to fuel its $60 billion blowup.Even more credibly decentralized platforms, like Uniswap, have faced scrutiny this week. The venture firm Andressen Horowitz and centralized exchange Binance have amassed a large amount of governance power within the leading decentralized exchange’s governance system.Though you may not agree with his full take, Ben Thompson encapsulated one skeptical viewpoint on DeFi in this week’s edition of his stellar Stratechery newsletter:“The FTX case is not, technically speaking, about cryptocurrency utility; it is a pretty straightforward case of fraud. Moreover, it was [...] a problem of centralization, as opposed to true DeFi. Such disclaimers do, though, have a whiff of ‘communism just hasn’t been done properly': I already made the case that centralization is an inevitability at scale, and in terms of utility, that’s the entire problem. An entire financial ecosystem with a void in terms of underlying assets may not be fraud in a legal sense, but it sure seems fraudulent in terms of intrinsic value.”Before his spectacular fall from grace last week, SBF was a kind of crypto golden boy. Dubbed the JP Morgan of Crypto, SBF recently began facing criticism in some corners of Crypto Twitter for his pro-regulation stances (which seem more cynical in retrospect), but in general, when he spoke, people listened.Despite long-standing questions around Alameda’s relationship with FTX, savvy investors trusted SBF, poured billions into his custody and promoted his platform to retail investors.The lionization of SBF in the mainstream press, crypto press and Crypto Twitter is undoubtedly a big reason why the FTX collapse was so painful. But now that SBF is public enemy number one, Twitter has been filled with a wave of self-righteous critics.Among the most vocal SBF critics over the past week have been recent industry villains like Terra creator Do Kwon and Three Arrows Capital (3AC) founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies. After months of relative quiet, the trio have used the negative attention on SBF to mount their own comebacks – hoping, apparently, that attacking the FTX founder along with everyone else will help them rebuild their own sullied reputations.It’s doubtful that any of these folks will succeed. However, the re-emergence of these characters – along with waves of sycophantic tweets in support of Binance’s Changpeng Zhao and Tron’s Justin Sun – should reminded us of the toxic role that hero worship has played, and continues to play in the “trustless” world of cryptocurrency.",2022/11/17
381,"Institutions and multi-asset investors returned to the crypto market last week, but not in a way the bulls would have liked to see.Analysts said these entities took short or bearish bets in bitcoin (BTC) futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), causing backwardation, where futures prices are lower than the spot price. And the market anomaly has created an ""arbitrage opportunity"" – a strategy aimed at profiting from price gap in different markets.""Institutional activity in CME has blossomed, but activity has been heavily concentrated towards the short side,"" Vetle Lunde said in a note to clients on Tuesday. ""CME’s November contract has traded at an extreme discount to spot in the last week.""Bitcoin's front-month CME futures traded at an average daily discount of around 3.6% (annualized 43.8%) last week, according to data provided by Arcane Research. That's wider than the discount seen during the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020 and the steepest on record.The number of active contracts, or open interest, on the CME has surged by nearly 37% to 93,000 BTC this month alongside an increase in discount, suggesting an influx of new money on the short side.""The futures discount signals severe negative sentiment among multi-asset investors that tend to carve out a small trading allocation towards CME listed cryptocurrency futures,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said.Institutions' renewed bearish stance comes amid fears that the recent collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange FTX, formerly the third-largest platform, will prolong the crypto winter.Griffin Blofin, a volatility trader from the crypto asset management firm Blofin, said the discount on the CME has been more significant than unregulated exchanges like Deribit and the situation may persist going forward.""Due to their generally cautious style, institutions will cut most high-risk exposures as fast as they can, causing a higher discount rate than other exchanges such as Deribit,"" Blofin said.At press time, monthly futures on Deribit traded at an annualized discount of 13.675%, while those on CME traded at 11%.The price discrepancy between spot and futures markets often attracts arbitrageurs – traders setting up market-neutral positions to profit from an eventual narrowing of futures premium/discount.In case of discount, arbitrageurs set up reverse cash-and-carry strategy, as observed following the March 2020 crash. The strategy involves setting up a direction-neutral position by borrowing and selling the asset in the spot market and purchasing a futures contract. That helps traders lock in the discount as profit while bypassing directional risks and the strategy makes money as the discount narrows.According to Thielen, the arbitrage window offered by bitcoin's futures discount could be short-lived.""In light of the better macro environment, this arbitrage opportunity will likely close in the near term as the macro environment appears to improve with 1) the USD might have peaked as US interest rate expectations are plateauing, 2) the Ukraine war appears to run out of steam and 3) China takes incremental steps of re-opening,"" Thielen told CoinDesk.The return from the strategy is limited to the extent of the discount at the time of setting up the trade adjusted for the cost incurred to borrow bitcoin. In other words, the strategy will make money only if the trader can borrow BTC at rates lower than the discount.Besides, the strategy is not without risks and may not be profitable if the sentiment fails to improve, keeping futures at a discount relative to the spot price.""For the reverse cash and carry trade, unless the market can quickly emerge from the shadow of FTX's bankruptcy, investors entering now are likely to be unprofitable, for the basis does not show signs of a significant return to the normal level,"" Ardern said.",2022/11/16
382,"The collapse of crypto exchange FTX derailed an emerging positive situation in cryptocurrency markets after the significant deleveraging of May and June left few, if any large, marginal sellers in the digital assets space, Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report Tuesday.The new turbulence in the cryptocurrency market and the lack of large buyers has left the sector vulnerable, potentially extending what was an already long crypto winter, analysts David Duong and Brian Cubellis wrote.FTX bankruptcy proceedings will be closely watched, but for the digital assets sector, a lot still depends on the path of interest rates in the U.S, the report said.The market is highly likely to see “second order effects” arising from the unraveling of FTX, as it emerges which counterparties have lent or interacted with either the exchange or its sister company, Alameda Research, and what those exact liabilities are, the note said.Coinbase says poor liquidity could last till at least the end of the year, noting that stablecoin dominance has risen to a very high 18% of the total crypto market cap, which itself has dropped to around $800 billion as of Nov. 12 from about $1 trillion at the end of last month. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold.“The combination of increasing hashrate (pushing up the difficulty as a result), rising energy costs and now weaker bitcoin prices has led to increasingly stressed economic conditions for bitcoin miners,” the note said. Hashrate is a measure of computing power devoted to mining bitcoin, and as the hashrate increases, so does the difficulty of producing the cryptocurrency.FTX’s demise has undoubtedly damaged investor confidence in the sector and remediation will take some time, potentially extending the crypto winter by several more months, perhaps through to the end of 2023, the note added.Read more: Bernstein: The Collapse of Crypto Exchange FTX More Like Enron Than Lehman ",2022/11/16

That's noteworthy, since bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, was largely trading in sync with U.S. stocks as recently as September.The market contagion from FTX spread rapidly in crypto, sending the 162-asset CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) down about 18% so far in November.And despite widespread headlines about the FTX-inflicted turmoil across traditional financial media, U.S. stocks were mostly unfazed – trading higher based on softer-than-expected inflation readings that inspired investor hopes of a less threatening monetary-tightening campaign by the Federal Reserve.The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is up 3.1% on the month.An analysis of CMI and its six sector indexes shows how correlations surged among the various digital assets from Nov. 7 to Nov. 11.The crypto market went into ""a highly correlated state after the FTX collapse,"" said Jodie Gunzberg, managing director of CoinDesk Indices.

In late October, only days before the current catastrophe unfolded, the Hong Kong government announced its ambitions to be a crypto hub once again and was considering relaxing the prohibition on retail crypto trading.“The SFC has been actively looking to set up a regime to authorize ETFs [that] provide exposure to mainstream virtual assets with appropriate investment guardrails,” Securities and Futures Commission Deputy Chief Executive Officer Julia Leung said at Hong Kong FinTech Week, as CoinDesk previously reported.Hong Kong Monetary Authority CEO Eddie Yue added that these new technologies could “develop very nicely in a healthy financial system like Hong Kong” with the right regulation.But Hong Kong’s authorities didn’t announce specific regulations. That’s going to come after a consultation period with the regulators themselves and industry stakeholders.Now, how do you think these conversations will go after the news broke that FTX has one million creditors in its bankruptcy proceedings? Local exchange AAX also is on the brink of failure, suspending operations until a new capital raise can be secured.Some of the million creditors cited in FTX’s bankruptcy will include hedge funds, institutional investors, or crypto entities – but some will also include retail investors, including Hong Kongers. If AAX goes under, who knows how many retail traders in HK will also be affected.The outcome of this will be a strict set of rules for the retail trading industry. There will be limitations on how the exchange operates. Some of them might be for the better, like the required use of licensed custodians, but some of them might deter traders, such as limitations on what tokens are available.Hong Kong regulators will certainly be cognizant of the risks of having overly strict regulations: The exchanges will be ghost towns and people will continue to trade offshore. But any regulator knows that regulation is a balancing act. Let’s see what the outcome is – if Hong Kong still wants to have retail crypto trading, that is.3:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:00 UTC) Bank of England Consumer Price Index (YoY/Oct)9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) United States Retail Sales (MoM/Oct)9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Bank of Canada Consumer Price Index Core (YoY/Oct)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:FTX Accounts Drainer Swaps Millions in Stolen Crypto; Journalism's Role in Crypto IndustryWhoever was behind last week’s $600 million exploit of crypto exchange FTX started moving millions of dollars in stolen funds.

386,"On five of six days this year following U.S. central bank interest rate decisions, bitcoin’s price has reversed course from its previous direction.BTC’s price has fallen on three occasions after rising sharply on the day of Fed rate hikes, and it has risen on two other days after falling when the Fed also raised interest rates. On one occasion, BTC’s price rose on the day of a Fed rate hike and continued its upward momentum the next day.Analysts say that the quick reversals underline investors desire to take profits quickly or extricate themselves from riskier assets amid a volatile macroeconomic environment. These investors have been trying to anticipate crypto markets' direction further afield following Fed decisions, which can have a deep impact on the economy.“A lot of the times, the very first move is not the move that sustains because that’s the position adjusting mode,” Bob Iacchino, Path Trading Partners co-founder and chief market strategist, said. “In other words, people have positions based on what they think the result is going to be, and when they get the exact result, they exit positions.”On May 4, for example, when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced that it would raise interest rates by 50 basis points, or a 0.5 percentage point, bitcoin jumped 5.2% as traders welcomed the Fed’s hawkishness in its ongoing attempt to tame inflation. However, the following day, bitcoin dropped 8%.On June 15, bitcoin surged 2% after the Fed boosted rates by 75 basis points, escalating its inflation-fighting efforts. But on June 16, BTC dropped 9.7%.Crypto markets’ reversals on days following Fed rate hikes have veered from equity markets’ performances on these days.For example, on only two of the six Fed decision days this year, in June and July, did the S&P 500 reverse the next day. Otherwise, the S&P has followed its previous course.“The S&P 500 is much more absorbed into day-to-day investing, so there’s a lot less volatility,” Iaccino said. Crypto traders, on the other hand, are “entrenched emotionally in what this asset is,” he said.In general, volatility before and after Fed days has been more intense than typical for all asset classes, Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya said. “Normally, we see limited posturing before Fed decisions, but this year was different as everyone was trying to get ahead of when the Fed pivot will happen,” he said.This will likely continue to be the case until the Fed is widely believed to be done tightening, Moya said.",2022/11/15
387,"Even in the depths of winter, crypto continues to make fundamental progress – especially in terms of adoption by the world’s top enterprises and institutions. Ethereum, the pioneering blockchain for innovative technologies such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, recently completed its much-anticipated Merge – sparking institutional interest and unlocking yield-generation opportunities via its proof-of-stake (POS) blockchain.Miles Fuller is the head of government solutions at TaxBit. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week.As an emerging asset class, crypto raises many perplexing questions for investors and regulators alike. At the same time, an October poll conducted by the Crypto Council for Innovation indicated that a majority of U.S. voters want more crypto regulation and believe that lawmakers should treat cryptocurrency as a serious and valid part of the economy. But the lack of regulatory clarity has been a significant barrier when it comes to crypto adoption for both individuals and institutions.In order to address this problem, we should seek to better understand a key component of regulation: taxes. Especially as they relate to NFTs, staking and yield farming.See also: The Key to Taxing Digital Assets Is Finding the Right Cubbyhole | OpinionIn November, Meta announced that Instagram will soon allow creators to mint and sell non-fungible tokens directly on the social platform. Reddit is helping take NFTs mainstream as well. Since opening its NFT marketplace in July, over 2.5 million new wallets have been created, and cumulative Reddit NFT sales have surpassed $6.5 million. As NFT initiatives by the world’s top enterprises continue to take flight, users should carefully consider the key tax implications:Read more: The Tax Impact of This Year's Platform and Protocol Failures | OpinionGiven the historic upgrade of Ethereum to proof-of-stake, and that many leading exchanges offer custodial staking opportunities (such as ETH annual percent staking yields as high as 4-5%), questions about staking rewards are top of mind for many U.S. investors. There’s no official guidance on how staking should be taxed, but the Internal Revenue Service appears to view it as taxable according to the following points:Given the lack of official guidance, an alternative view has been posited that rewards received from staking are not taxable upon receipt. Instead, any rewards received from staking may not be taxable until the eventual sale. Upon eventual sale, the rewards would be taxable as ordinary income (rather than capital gains), so they will not receive a favorable tax rate.This view was being litigated in federal court in Tennessee regarding Tezos staking rewards as part of a claim for a tax refund, but the government granted the refund and the case was dismissed. So, unless the IRS makes an express statement about the matter or it arises in litigation again, the issue will remain unresolved.In the case of Ethereum staking rewards via a centralized exchange such as Coinbase, the platform may issue a 1099-MISC to individuals and the IRS for users who earn at least $600 in “miscellaneous” income. Regardless of whether or not rewards can be unlocked, the safest path is likely to treat all rewards as income at fair market value according to the moment of receipt.The 2022 U.S. individual income tax return prominently highlights “Digital Assets” for hundreds of millions of taxpayers to see. As part of the instructions, the 1040 Form says: “Check ‘Yes’ if at any time during 2022 you: Received new digital assets as a result of mining, staking, and similar activities.”As discussed above, this question reveals that the IRS likely views the receipt of staking rewards as a taxable event. Separately, the inclusion of “similar activities” also indicates that the IRS likely views any receipt of a digital asset that was not made through a purchase with cash or exchange of other property as a taxable event. The language appears to encompass a wide array of income-generating activities, including DeFi activities such as yield farming and liquidity farming.While there is no official guidance on the tax treatment of DeFi activities such as yield farming, there are key points to consider:The lack of explicit guidance and the disconnect between the actual receipt of yield in DeFi and data reflecting that receipt for record-keeping purposes makes DeFi currently one of the more difficult aspects of digital asset taxation.See also: Why Selling Some Bitcoin at a Loss Can Maximize Your Holding Potential | OpinionAlthough there are still many gray areas, crypto adoption is continuing at a remarkable pace. Individuals and institutions should carefully consider their tax obligations, and in the absence of official guidance, should consult tax professionals or take the most conservative approach so as to avoid costly audits in the future.Some of this uncertainty should be resolved as the IRS continues to issue guidance. Proposed regulations implementing tax reporting rules for digital asset brokers will help clarify some of the tax rules and make things easier for taxpayers to report their taxes accurately.The IRS recently identified tax guidance relating to digital asset transaction validation, including staking, as a priority during 2023. As the digital asset ecosystem continues to grow and the tokenized economy takes hold, it will be imperative for the IRS to, whenever possible, issue guidance clarifying the tax treatment of certain activities.",2022/11/15
388,"Blockchain technology is ever-evolving, and so is the often subjective art of blockchain analysis.Nowhere is that truer than now, in the wake of the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange – as the crypto industry faces a radical reckoning with concepts like risk and trust.Recent on-chain data shows a change in custodial attitude by investors, while implying a continued interest in acquiring and holding digital assets.As the fallout from the FTX collapse widens, trust in centralized exchanges has reached an all-time low. It’s not irrational, given recent events.Glassnode data shows that bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges have sharply increased, with BTC balances on these platforms falling by 72.9K BTC ($1.2B) in just seven days.The metric looks to capture the movement of coins from exchanges and on to self-custody wallets. It's a measure of movement, not liquidation. Investors are essentially saying, “I trust the asset, but no longer trust you.”The same is evident for ether (ETH), as investors withdrew 1.01 million ETH from exchanges over the past seven days.The FTX collapse marks a new starting point in how investors use exchange balances of BTC and ETH. Often, increases in the exchange balances for BTC and ETH implies bearish sentiment, as coins are sent to exchanges to ready them for sale.But a comparison of current levels to levels prior to November 2022 may give investors a distorted view.Now, the outflows might be signaling something very different: that users don’t want their coins sitting on the exchange – as a precaution against the risk of another deposit run similar to what just happened at FTX.While the supply of BTC and ETH has declined on exchanges, the supply of stablecoins has increased. The significance of this is that stablecoins represent buying power. So as stablecoins move on to exchanges, investors are ensuring they have enough dry powder to be opportunistic.Bitcoin and ether prices are under pressure as cryptocurrencies endure the current, harsh crypto winter.BTC and ETH were trading sideways on Monday, albeit slightly more to the green. .A key observation is that market correlations of cryptocurrency prices have shifted recently.The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization have been trading in lockstep as their correlation coefficient has increased to 0.99. Correlation coefficients range from 1 to -1, with the former indicating a perfectly direct relationship, and the latter implying a completely inverse one.Since Nov. 7, the 30-DAY correlation between BTC and the S&P 500 has fallen from 0.79 to -0.44. For ETH, the shift was from .61 to -0.49.Given the unique nature of the FTX collapse, it stands to reason that correlations will ultimately revert back to prior norms as the fallout subsides. As that occurs, digital asset markets could be poised to push higher.",2022/11/15
389,"Four years ago, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said he “didn’t give a [damn] about bitcoin.” On Nov. 3, 2022, the investment bank and financial services holding company executed its first trade on Polygon and a modified version of Aave.If you think the embrace of crypto from retail investors over the last 10 years was a whirlwind, wait for the tsunami coming over the horizon: Enterprise and institutional adoption of digital assets.Pat White is the co-founder and CEO of Bitwave, a software platform that provides cryptocurrency accounting, tax tracking, bookkeeping, decentralized finance ROI monitoring and crypto AR/AP services for enterprise businesses. This piece is part of CoinDesk's tax week.But just as enormous tailwinds have brought us to this point, a balanced set of regulatory, tax and compliance headwinds holds many enterprises at bay.Let’s dig into the state of enterprise crypto adoption and explore three common tax and compliance challenges new enterprise blockchain adopters must address.In 20 years, when we look back, the tail end of 2022 will go down as the most pivotal period for enterprise adoption of digital assets.First, Ethereum’s switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake made the network less energy intensive and, thus, friendlier to corporate environment and social governance (ESG) goals. Then, in a series of events, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) proposed accounting rules that would lower the financial stigma associated with companies holding crypto, which was promptly followed by preliminary tax guidance from the Internal Revenue Service.Read more: How to Benefit From Tax-Loss Harvesting in Crypto | OpinionFor chief financial officers at publicly traded companies or others who have to consider the financial, product-level and board-level impacts of digital asset adoption, these changes alleviate the blood-red hole in their profit and loss statements (P&L), further the board’s ESG goals and allow the product team to finally benefit from this transformative technology.If anything, it’s already happening. Organizations including BNY Mellon, Nike, Roofstock, Gucci, Chipotle and Telefónica are using digital assets to:In the coming years we’ll see the blockchain applied to supply chain management, finance (asset tokenization) and energy (carbon tracking/credits). Despite these advancements, organizations will still need to address common tax and compliance challenges, regardless of where they fall in the digital asset maturity curve, including:The importance of accessing data cannot be understated. After all, it’s hard to account for transaction activity without hard data. And even though a lot of the accounting data needed for tax and compliance is on-chain, that doesn't mean it’s easy to work with. Of course, that’s ignoring the gigabytes of off-chain data sitting in exchanges, custodians and internal databases. Let’s just say a lot of data is required to get a complete picture of an organization's finances, and it doesn’t organize itself.This brings us to the second area many organizations struggle with: understanding data.One of the most significant issues in crypto accounting is the fallacy of network data. Many people assume that the blockchain is an all-seeing, all-documenting technology, and in some ways it is. But block explorers aren’t bank statements and can only get you so far. Copying and pasting data from Etherscan to a spreadsheet isn’t sufficient to understand what is happening from an accounting and tax perspective. You need to keep lookup tables of addresses for your customers and vendors, internal wallets and the smart contracts deployed.See also: Why NFT Tax-Loss Harvesting Remains a Challenge for Investors | OpinionThere are also instances where the data collected is opaque. For example, interacting with a decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity pool can pose challenges to even the most seasoned accountant, if for no other reason than no one in the industry can agree on how these transactions should be treated.This brings us to the last challenge: tracking holdings.Many organizations think you can track digital assets like forex using the average cost basis as the answer. Sadly, nothing could be further from the truth. At Bitwave, we like to say crypto is an unholy alliance of forex and inventory – it’s like a foreign currency you have to track at a lot level, or like inventory that you sometimes just decide to pay your employees and suppliers with.That is to say, in order to complete a picture of the cost basis for tax purposes, you must track tokens lot by lot. This makes sense because ether (ETH) purchased in 2022 sure has a different value than ETH purchased in 2020.Getting a headache reading this? I get it. Fortunately, many software programs can automate these processes for your organization. And while these kinds of things aren’t one-size-fits-all, there are a couple of best practices I recommend to help navigate tax season.Good wallet hygiene is essential as organizations scale because it helps accountants understand transactions from a workflow perspective as they process them. Always keep transaction-specific wallets (e.g., investments, DeFi transactions, revenue, etc.), and use a consistent naming system. For example, if your client is a non-fungible token (NFT) creator, ensure it keeps a separate wallet for primary vs. secondary royalty payments.In the normal fiat world you just need to find a knowledgeable certified public accountant (CPA). In crypto, everyone needs to be an expert in their field and the industry itself.Get yourself a CPA who understands the complexities of accounting and knows the pain of paying 2 ETH in gas fees for a failed transaction during an NFT drop. It’s crucial that your CPA can play both sides, because even though regulators are finally starting to update guidance for crypto assets there is a lot of uncertainty.And on this note, talk to your CPA early and often. We work with a lot of CPAs and I promise, they’re great people! But that’s not exactly why we recommend this – digital asset accounting isn’t something you can chuck over the fence once a month; your CPA is going to need your help. Trust me – it’ll save you from headaches and, it is hoped, an audit.This wave of crypto adoption has created a new wave of tax and compliance challenges, so it's up to the crypto-natives to help Fortune 500s bridge the chasm to adoption. Fortunately for them, there’s an amazing group of builders laying the foundation for an open, transparent and equitable financial system.",2022/11/15
390,"Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network told the court Tuesday it had $12 million in outstanding loans to Alameda Research, the trading wing of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire.That money – part of which is represented in locked SRM tokens held as collateral –  is now likely wrapped up in Alameda’s own bankruptcy proceedings, adding another obstacle for Celsius’ creditors. It and some 130-odd other entities tied to Bankman-Fried filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week after a bank run exposed a multi-billion-dollar hole in FTX’s reserves.Read more: Celsius' Crypto Customers Face Big Obstacle in Trying to Claw Back Their DepositsCelsius’ new CEO Chris Ferraro said the company used to have much more at risk. In January 2020, for example, Celsius had $3.6 billion in total exposure to FTX Group. But it whittled down its exposure to $354 million immediately prior to its own bankruptcy filing earlier this year.Celsius is the latest crypto company to disclose its exposure to crypto exchange FTX and trader and market maker Alameda Research.Ferraro told the court that Celsius’ outstanding loans were part of its revenue generation,  post-bankruptcy, though he admitted that the bankrupt crypto lender’s revenue is currently “obviously at a much lower clip, than it was pre-filing, pre-pause.”Ferraro also said Celsius is generating a “moderate amount of top-line revenue” across staking deployments and its mining business.Read more: Celsius Lays Out Mining-Focused Reorganization Plan at First Bankruptcy HearingAccording to Ferraro, Celsius has 37,000 mining units currently hosted by Core Scientific. Celsius has reportedly defaulted on payments to Core Scientific, which is facing its own financial trouble. Core Scientific has claimed that Celsius owes it over $5 million in unpaid bills.Despite Celsius’ seeming inability to pay Core Scientific, Ferraro told the court that it was “incredibly strategic and important” that Celsius continue to build out a mining facility in Midland, Texas. The Midland site currently has 3,000 mining rigs, according to Ferraro.The judge asked Ferraro if the recent price drop in bitcoin meant Celsius’ nascent mining operation was now losing money.“From an operational perspective, we are cash flow positive,” Ferraro told the judge. “The margins are compressed – it’s probably around 20%, where we sit today, but you know, we have the ability to shut off the machines if they cost more to produce a bitcoin than the amount that we can mint it for.”",2022/11/15

392,"The swift and surprising collapse of crypto exchange FTX last week continues to send shock waves across the crypto industry and beyond – and Capitol Hill isn't immune.Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was, until last week, a major political donor – he gave $5.2 million to U.S. President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign and spent another $40 million supporting mainly Democratic candidates ahead of the November midterm elections – and an influential figure in Washington.Bankman-Fried regularly met with regulators and lawmakers, weighing in on how the crypto industry should be regulated. He was a vocal supporter of one bill, in particular: the bipartisan Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA), a still-in-progress bill backed by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and ranking member, Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.).This year, Bankman-Fried has donated at least $26,600 to Stabenow and $8,700 to Boozman. In June, he donated $16,600 to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who signed onto the bill in September, and in 2021, he donated $5,700 to Sen. Cory Booker (D- N.J.), another co-sponsor of the bill.That bill sits at the intersection of the existential question now facing the crypto industry: Why did FTX collapse and how can repeats be prevented? FTX was a centralized exchange, a single point of failure – that did indeed fail, seemingly because of choices made by Bankman-Fried – in the crypto ecosystem.Many crypto purists, on the other hand, argue this is a moment to double down on crypto’s origin story, which critics of the DCCPA argue the bill would undermine. Born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin was proposed as a decentralized way of running a financial system. Today, that idea lives on in decentralized exchanges (DEXes) like Uniswap and the rest of decentralized finance (DeFi).DCCPA’s detractors say it would effectively kill DeFi in the U.S. by making it impossible for large players like Uniswap to comply, which would entrench centralized exchanges. The argument is basically that the regulatory requirements outlined in the latest draft of the bill (posted to GitHub by Delphi Labs general counsel Gabriel Shapiro) amount to a de-facto ban on DeFi.In the wake of FTX’s collapse and Bankman-Fried’s subsequent fall from grace, opponents of the bill have proclaimed the DCCPA to be “dead,” a supposition that lawmakers, including the bill’s sponsors, have pushed back on.In a statement issued on Nov. 10, Boozman said the collapse of FTX only reinforced the need for more federal oversight of the crypto industry.“Chairwoman [Stabenow] and I remain committed to advancing a final version of the DCCPA that creates a regulatory framework that allows for international cooperation and gives consumers greater confidence that their investments are safe,” Boozman said.With his statement, Boozman joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who have expressed concern about the collapse of FTX and the need for crypto regulation.As one of the most fully formed pieces of potential crypto legislation, it seems the DCCPA is not, in fact, dead, despite the shadow cast over it by Bankman-Fried’s ruined legacy.The DCCPA aims to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight of the crypto spot market. Under the DCCPA, crypto broker-dealers would be required to register with the CFTC and submit to oversight from the federal regulator.The bill can be roughly divided into two sections: requirements for “crypto commodity platforms,” which includes brokers, dealers, custodians and exchanges, and requirements for the CFTC.Crypto commodity platforms would be required to maintain a relationship with the CFTC similar to other commodity dealers. For example, they would need to keep good records for at least five years, share information with the CFTC upon request, appoint a chief compliance officer and submit to provisions that protect against “fraud, deceit and manipulation.”The DCCPA also requires that crypto commodity platforms have adequate financial resources to hold customer funds “in a manner that minimizes the risk of loss or of unreasonable delay in access to the customer property.” Commingling of customer funds with the broker-dealer’s assets is strictly prohibited (something Bankman-Fried has been accused of), as is investing customer funds in anything other than U.S. Treasurys or other “high-quality liquid assets that the Commission may by rule or regulation prescribe.”Unlike several of its predecessors, the DCCPA also has a lengthy definitions section that carves out exemptions to the rules for non-commodity platform entities, including software developers and validators. The CFTC is also not given jurisdiction over any crypto transactions used in the purchase of a good or service.The DCCPA also requires the CFTC to produce several reports within 180 days of the bill’s passing – including one on “historically underserved customers” that will examine the racial, ethnic and gender demographics of crypto users and another on the energy consumption of mining cryptocurrencies. If the DCCPA becomes law, both reports will be periodically updated and used to inform future legislation.The DCCPA also states that the CFTC will be tasked with “international harmonization,” which means working with foreign regulators to create consistent international standards for crypto regulation.The potential impact on decentralized exchanges – seen by many as an attempt by Bankman-Fried to use regulation to push users away from DEXs and toward centralized exchanges including what was his own – has been made only more galling for many DeFi supporters after Bankman-Fried’s alleged fraud was exposed.The leaked version of the draft, however, contains changes that imply that Stabenow and Boozman are sensitive to concerns that the bill could be interpreted as a blanket ban on DeFi.In October, Shapiro, the Delphi Labs lawyer, tweeted that the leaked version contains a limited exception to the term “digital commodity trading facility” that removes the word “person” from the definition and adds a line that exempts a person who “develops or publishes software” from the definition – adding that he thought the wording could be a “boon to DeFi/crypto.”",2022/11/15
393,"Cryptocurrency and digital-asset markets have seen extreme drawdowns throughout 2022. With bitcoin (BTC) alone down over 50% this year, the portfolios of many investors are in the red this year.While investors are feeling the pain from the market downturn, it’s important to remember that crypto losses come with a silver lining: the opportunity for tax savings.David Kemmerer is a software entrepreneur and the co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency tax software company CoinLedger. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week.Cryptocurrencies as an asset class possess unique characteristics that make them especially good candidates for tax-loss harvesting. Let’s break down why it’s a good idea to take advantage of your crypto losses before the end of 2022.In the U.S. and many other developed nations, capital losses fully deduct against other capital gains when they occur within the same tax year.What does that mean?If you will have capital gains from the sales of any capital asset in 2022 – whether that be stocks, real estate or cryptocurrencies – you can offset those gains by realizing your cryptocurrency losses. That can lead to huge tax savings.Surprisingly, there is a lot of confusion among everyday investors with regard to this fact. Many investors don’t realize that their capital losses can deduct against an unlimited amount of capital gains.Consider the following example: Imagine Cory sells Apple (AAPL) stock in 2022 and realizes $50,000 of capital gains in doing so. If Cory is a high earner, he could face a 37% tax on that $50,000 gain, or $18,500 owed to Uncle Sam. Ouch!Read more: David Kemmerer - Form 1099-B Is Not the Solution to Your Cryptocurrency Tax ProblemsNow, let’s say Cory is also holding onto 30 NFTs that he paid a total of $35,000 for in 2022. Today, the value of those non-fungible tokens is only $1,000.If Cory harvests, or realizes, the capital losses from his NFTs by selling them for $1,000, he would reduce his taxable income by $34,000. As a result, Cory’s NFT losses would fully deduct against his Apple stock gains.In this scenario, Cory’s taxable gains fall to $16,000 ($50,000 minus $34,000). At a 37% tax bracket, Cory would now owe just $5,920 in taxes for his capital gains.By strategically leveraging his capital losses, Cory reduced the amount of money he will have to pay the tax man by over $12,000.If you have offset all of your capital gains for the year and wind up with a net capital loss, that capital loss can offset up to $3,000 of your ordinary income (like the income from your job). Any remainder can carry forward to offset gains in future years.Tax-loss harvesting is by no means a new strategy. However, cryptocurrency’s unique properties make it well-suited for tax-loss harvesting compared to other assets.Hyper-volatility: Because cryptocurrency is more volatile than other assets, it’s likely that investors will have multiple opportunities to harvest their losses during the tax year.The wash sale rule: The wash sale rule states that you cannot claim a capital loss on a security if you buy the same asset within 30 days of a sale. Many tax professionals, however, take the position that because cryptocurrency is considered property by the Internal Revenue Service and not a security, it is not currently subject to the wash-sale rule.Read more: Jackson Wood - How to Benefit From Tax-Loss Harvesting in CryptoTo take full advantage of your tax-savings opportunities, you should analyze your portfolio prior to the end of 2022 to assess which assets present significant loss-harvesting opportunities. Software tools can be used to automate this process for you.Remember, if you don’t realize or lock in your losses before Dec 31, you will lose the opportunity to reduce your taxable income for 2022.Significant tax-savings opportunities should be on the table for the majority of crypto investors in 2022. Taking a moment to employ the right tax-reduction tactics could wind up saving you thousands on your tax bill.You’ll be thanking yourself once the April 15 deadline rolls around.",2022/11/15
394,"Long-term bitcoin (BTC) holders' resolve to keep building their coin stashes has weakened amid fears that the implosion of crypto exchange FTX will prolong the crypto winter. The exchange, founded by entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried and formerly the third largest in the world, filed for bankruptcy last week.The change in stance is notable because the investors weren't fazed in the third quarter even as macro traders left the market, keeping bitcoin resilient to the macroeconomy-induced turmoil in traditional assets. Their shift now to distribution from accumulation perhaps represents concern about the strength of the market following FTX's collapse.""There has certainly been a degree of immediate panic within the HODLer cohort,"" analytics firm Glassnode said in a weekly report published Monday, referring to the decline in the supply owned by long-term holders and the movement of inactive coins.The total amount of circulating supply owned by long-term holders has declined by 61,500 BTC ($1.03 billion) since Nov. 6, marking a shift away from accumulation observed between the end of June and early November, data published by Glassnode shows.Another metric, the long-term holder net position change, shows more than 48,000 BTC were spent in the week ended Sunday. Glassnode defines long-term holder supply as the one that is statistically the least likely to be spent. In addition, more than 97,000 BTC that were inactive or dormant for over a year moved last week and possibly returned to the cryptocurrency's circulating supply.According to digital assets data provider Amberdata, FTX's implosion will have many consequences, including the ""potential demonization of crypto space politically and a daisy chain of balance sheet capital short-falls for various institutions."" Some analysts studying chart patterns see bitcoin falling to $13,000 in the near term.While long-term holders have begun distributing coins, it's still too early to call a long-lasting bearish shift in sentiment, according to Glassnode.""A sustained push higher in older coins being spent, and a decline in LTH supply would be clear warning signs that a more widespread loss of conviction and concern may be in play,"" Glassnode noted, using an acronym for long-term holders.",2022/11/15
395,"The collapse of FTX and Alameda Research impacts the centralized finance (CeFi) part of the crypto industry the most, Bernstein said in a research report Monday. Part of the crypto ecosystem is exposed to this event, but it is not the entire industry, the report added.The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and blockchain-based applications, “gain from this fragility, subject to some regulatory boundaries and negotiations,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote. DeFi is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on blockchains.Bernstein says there needs to be a distinction made between the centralized custodial players in crypto, namely the exchanges, custodians, and crypto banks, as this is where regulation is coming. This will involve rules around maintaining reserves and uniform accounting for custodial firms, the broker said. Governments and regulators may also increase their scrutiny of offshore exchanges, where regulations are lighter, it added.Binance market share is likely to increase following the FTX debacle, and Binance.com, which is offshore, is likely to continue along its arduous path of converting its exchange into a more onshore structure, the note said.The broker sees a significant liquidity impact on the crypto market in coming weeks, which will hurt the smaller tokens.“FTX feels closer to Enron than Lehman,” the report said. FTX was the third largest exchange with only a 10% market share, but the “noise it has created has been disproportionately more,” perhaps because of the profile of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was hailed as the “genius industry savior.”Enron and Lehman were two famous corporate collapses that occurred in TradFi in the years prior to the creation of the first cryptocurrency bitcoin (BTC) in 2009, and were the result of accounting scandals.Echoing comments made by Wall Street rival Citi in a report last week, Bernstein says that decentralized exchanges (DEXs) continue to see traction, especially after the failure of FTX.FTX’s failure could be the catalyst that forces the hand of regulators to accelerate regulation, the note added.Read more: Morgan Stanley Says There Is Still Much Leverage in the Crypto Ecosystem",2022/11/15
396,"At their peak last November, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications stored more than $10 billion on the Solana network, its popularity being led by high-flying proponents including Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the FTX crypto exchange, Multicoin Capital, Sino Global Capital and other venture funds.A year later, the total value locked (TVL) has dropped to just over $300 million with FTX filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and facing prosecution, Multicoin and Sino Global reporting multimillion-dollar losses and the Solana Foundation itself losing ""tens of millions.""Bankman-Fried’s downfall translated to generally falling sentiment for Solana, given his prominent endorsement of the network. He once infamously told a crypto trader on Twitter: “I'll buy as much SOL has you have, right now, at $3...Then go f**k off,"" referring to the blockchain's native token.While the $10 billion TVL on Solana has declined over the past year, with the price of SOL contributing to that drop, the past two weeks have been more drastic. More than $700 million has exited Solana-based applications, a 70% drop from the $1 billion in TVL on Nov. 2, when CoinDesk first reported on the collusion between treasury accounts at FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research.SOL’s 50% price drop has contributed to that fall, alongside falling prices of related DeFi tokens.Lending and borrowing platform Solend took the biggest hit both in percentage and value terms. It held over $280 million on Nov. 2 and now holds under $30 million. Data show a vast amount of stablecoins, wrapped bitcoin tokens and Solana-based tokens have left the protocol.Data from DeFiLlama show Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs) Raydium and Orca are now the largest decentralized applications (dApps) on the network, locking up over $51 million and $46 million respectively. Both have seen over 40% in liquidity exit the platform in the past week. And both held over $150 million just a few weeks ago.Amid all the drama, some say the declines might help the market find a fair value for Solana and other networks.“Solana has undoubtedly taken a massive blow, and the consequences of this blow seem far more dramatic and painful than for other blockchains,” Alexei Kulevets, co-founder of Walken told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Yet we’re in the midst of bear market, restless and unpredictable as it may be, it will eventually reveal the true worth of projects and token.""Read more: FTX Hack Sparks Revolution at Serum DEX as Solana Devs Plot Alameda's Ouster",2022/11/15
397,"The bitcoin market has recently awakened from a prolonged slumber, putting bears in the driver's seat. That's the message from experts studying chart patterns, who now see a high chance of bitcoin sliding to $14,000 or below.The top cryptocurrency fell 22% last week, hitting a two-year low of $15,600 as FTX's collapse dented investor confidence. The decline marked a downside break of months of horizontal or sideways trading above $18,000, opening doors for a notable sell-off.""From a technical perspective, bitcoin has now broken below $18,000, which was an area of support in recent weeks. The next levels to watch are $13,500, the 2019 high, and $12,500 (the 3Q20 high),"" strategists at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients on Friday.Range breakdowns or breakouts usually bring a notable decline or rally. According to technical analysis theory, an asset builds potential energy during consolidation and this energy is unleashed in the direction in which the range is eventually breached. The longer the consolidation, the bigger the energy store and post-breakout/breakdown move. Seasoned traders, therefore, avoid trading against the range breakdown or breakout.""Firstly, think of the consolidation range like a spring, coiled up over time and full of potential energy. Each successful bounce off of support and rejection from resistance adds more potential energy,"" analysts at Delphi Digital said in a note sent to subscribers on Friday. ""When prices do eventually break from the range, the impulse move can be extremely strong, much like the initial unwind of a coiled spring.""Technical patterns can and often do fail. However, bitcoin's latest range breakdown is likely to bring more pain, as adverse macroeconomic conditions and FTX's collapse are likely to keep investor risk appetite under pressure.""This breakdown has been accompanied by one of the worst crypto catalysts to date, weighing on investor sentiment and asset prices. Combine the native crypto catalyst in the FTX-Alameda blowup with a continued bleak macroeconomic backdrop that has not materially changed, and continuation to the downside is the path of least resistance at this point as opposed to a reversal,"" Delphi's team noted, citing support between $14,000 and $16,000.Michael Oliver, the founder of Momentum Structural Analysis, said bitcoin's flush out through the range lows may have kicked off the bottoming process, though the market may not find a bottom anytime soon.""That presumed basing action [above $18,000] might be a precursor to a bottom, but a flush-out through the range lows was likely to be next in any bottoming process. It has begun,"" Oliver said in the weekly note.""Based on various metrics, we suspect lower will be seen and quite possibly, this market might not find an effective low until we get into December. But for now, let it rip,"" Oliver added.Bitcoin changed hands at $16,800 at press time.",2022/11/15

On Saturday, DeFi protocols across the Solana ecosystem began unplugging from the onchain exchange that Bankman-Fried had lauded for fear that they didn’t know who wielded control – a concern fueled by the FTX hack.

There’s no question about it. It’ll be called regulation.”By Sam ReynoldsImagine for a moment if there were a class of companies whose sole job was to safeguard customers’ assets being held by an exchange or other institution from theft, hacks or misuse by executives. And imagine if these companies were registered with the government, insured and regularly audited, with the results available for the public to inspect.Now imagine if the majority of exchanges didn’t use these services because it slowed their business down.Welcome to November 2022.“If you use an external independent, licensed custodian, we would never have gotten into this situation because they couldn't have had access to customer deposits,” Alessio Quaglini, CEO of Hex Trust, said in an interview with CoinDesk.Quaglini said that with a custodian, clients’ assets are legally and technologically segregated, available for public monitoring via block explorers, and insured. Assets are disclosed, as are liabilities.To put it bluntly: the funds would have been safe from outsider threats, insider threats, and Alameda Research.“The ledger would have been at least managed by an independent party versus the kind of internal ledger that they were using between FTX and Alameda,” said Quaglini. “The frosting on the cake was the ‘hack’ where employees were leaving, nobody knew who was in charge of what, and then all of the sudden funds disappear because you don’t know who’s in control of the private keys.”Despite all the due diligence that was allegedly done on FTX by some of the world’s most important venture capital funds like Sequoia, Softbank, and Temasek, this issue never came up. Caught in the Bankman-Fried cult of personality, these VCs never thought it necessary to have some safeguards in place to protect customer funds — which would have certainly been a requirement in the TradFi world.“Investors are guilty in this case of throwing money [at FTX] without asking for really basic things like segregation [of] clients’ assets. The fact that investors were not demanding this was quite embarrassing,” said Quaglini.In July 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), greenlit nationally chartered banks in the U.S. to provide custodian services for crypto. In the days following that announcement, crypto raced from $9,514 to over $11,000.Institutional capital was accustomed to having custodians, and this was the key to unlocking this narrative. This is how the asset class hit $1 trillion, and another Mt. Gox was prevented.Some exchanges have their own custodians, like Coinbase and Gemini. These are separate entities from the main exchange, licensed appropriately under local law (Coinbase and Gemini both have New York licenses).But FTX did not.Nor does Binance.Without custodians, and their requirements for public disclosure, we have no way of checking who’s solvent and who’s insolvent. Publicly known wallets can help, but that’s not the full picture. The public will have to take the word of executives at face value, and pray that Crypto.com’s balance sheet is as strong as it claims.Exchanges are now effectively operating as unregulated banks with fractional reserve banking minus the capital requirements, regulations, or ironically, transparency.Something has to change. Hopefully, it's not stringent regulation that strangles the industry.Binance’s Changpeng Zhao wants to establish an industry association to promote best practices as part of his recovery fund. But will this include the use of licensed custodians? Time will tell.

399,"Call it the “Alameda gap.”Last week’s collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s trading firm, Alameda Research, has left such a big hole in cryptocurrency markets that trading liquidity has thinned noticeably, according to a new report from Kaiko.The drop in liquidity over the past week is far larger than in any previous market drawdown, and it could be “here to stay” in the short term, according to Kaiko – especially since other trading firms including Amber Group and Genesis Trading have reported funds being trapped on FTX.Since Nov. 5, bitcoin liquidity within 2% of the mid-price has fallen from 11,800 BTC to 7,000 BTC, the lowest since early June, according to Kaiko, which analyzed data from 18 crypto exchanges.Kraken’s bitcoin (BTC) market depth has fallen by 57%, Bitstamp’s by 32%, Binance’s by 25%, and Coinbase’s by 18%, according to the report.Kaiko said ether (ETH) markets were also affected by the collapse, with 2% market depth, falling to late May levels.BTC’s price fell more than 21% in the past seven days, trading around $16,200 as of Monday midday, while ETH was down 23% over the past week to $1,210.Altcoins get hurt moreKaiko said liquidity in altcoins might be “more concerning,” especially those that were significant holdings of Alameda, such as Solana’s SOL.SOL’s total market depth has fallen 50% from 1 million SOL to under 500,000 SOL aggregated across all order books, according to Kaiko: “This drop was felt on every single exchange.”Solan's SRM and MAPS tokens have also seen a plunge in depth, the report noted.Solana’s SOL token dropped as low as $12.08 in the past 24 hours, hitting its lowest level in over 20 months, before settling back to about $13 Monday. SRM was one of the biggest losers in the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) as its price fell 22% in the past 24 hours to $0.16.“Alameda held a huge amount of illiquid tokens while (almost certainly) being a market maker for these same tokens, which put the firm in a nearly impossible position when faced with insolvency,” the report added.Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, said that market liquidity levels may stay under pressure until the Federal Reserve tempers its campaign to tighten monetary conditions.“Even though the sentiment has been dented overall, the market will eventually recover, especially as macro contributors, like the Fed easing up on interest hikes, become dominant,” he said. “We expect the liquidity to remain relatively dry until the market begins to pick up and market confidence is restored.”",2022/11/14
400,"Bitcoin mining company TeraWulf (WULF) raised $17 million in capital in the third quarter, but its liquidity remains at $4.5 million, according to a statement on its third quarter earnings  released after the market close on Monday.The $17 million came from $9.5 million in equity from existing investors and $7.5 million of incremental proceeds under a term loan. The Monday statement said that $138.5 million of principal under the term loan was outstanding at the end of the quarter.Cash flow has proven to be a key determinant of miners' ability to navigate the bear market, with some major miners facing liquidity crises that could even lead them to bankruptcy.TeraWulf's costs of revenue increased dramatically in the quarter as energy prices in New York State, where it mainly operates, soared while it increased its energy demand with new operations. The miner paid 134% in costs per dollar of revenue, compared to 43% in Q2. The miner is trying to bring costs down for 2023, the statement said.In the same quarter, TeraWulf significantly increased its hashrate, or computing power, and energy capacity that could be used for deploying mining machines. About 50 megawatts (MW) of power were brought online at its mining facility in Lake Mariner in upstate New York. The company had 11,000 miners operating at the end of the quarter, and another 9,000 are scheduled to be plugged into the 50 MW in Lake Mariner. As a result of the expansion, WULF mined 117 bitcoin in the third quarter, compared to 29 in the second quarter.WULF share prices were down 0.8% in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq on Monday.TeraWulf also said it ""right-sized"" its investment in a joint venture with a subsidiary of Talen Energy to 25%. The venture relates to a 200 MW mine in Pennsylvania, dubbed Nautilus.The miners' computing power goal for the first quarter of 2023 remained unchanged at 5.8 exahash/second (EH/s).TeraWulf is one of the most indebted publicly listed miners compared with its equity, data analyzed by CoinDesk in June showed.Read more: Bitcoin Miner Bitfarms Pays Down $27M of Debt",2022/11/14

402,"The growing push for crypto firms to adopt proof-of-reserves balance sheet validation emulates a practice long used in the physical commodities world.The initiative, which none other than Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has been pushing and that venture capitalist Nic Carter addresses in this CoinDesk opinion piece, would require exchanges to verify their assets. FTX’s implosion over the last 10 days – a result of propping up the affiliated trading firm Alameda Research with its own FTT tokens – raised the question about an industry-wide epidemic of balance sheets being out-of-whack or improperly managed. The current, intense period of reassessment will likely morph from “who uses proof-of-reserves” to “who uses it most often.”The commodities industry has been using validation for years to assure investors of their solvency and build confidence in those markets and companies. That bitcoin and ether are often referred to as “digital gold” and “digital oil” now seems more appropriate than ever.Oil and gas entities attest to their reserve balances at the end of each year. Investors, analysts and traders are accustomed to reading through these attestations and determining the extent to which a firm’s valuation may or may not have changed.Below is the most recent oil and gas proved reserves report for the U.S., released Jan. 13, 2022. As you can see, the U.S. proved reserves declined 19% between Dec. 31, 2019 and Dec. 31, 2020.“Proved reserves” are widely recognized as having a 90% chance of successful extraction. Lower tier categories, “probable” and “possible” reserves, denote much lower probabilities of success, but are often justifiably excluded from a company’s valuation.Standardization of definitions and methodology in determining reserve balances is key for the system’s success, ensuring that analysts and investors can evaluate entities versus each other, and monitor trends on an apples-to-apples basis.The myriad issues that the crypto sector has faced over the last six months appear to be individual- and entity-based, and not asset-based. Bitcoin and ether continue to operate as intended.Cryptocurrencies' efficacy as mediums of exchange, units of account and vessels to store value remain intact. Decentralized finance, which operates on code, fared especially well during the turmoil, although the odds of DeFi being carved out of the criticism caused by centralized failures are low. Crises have a way of sweeping up everything in their path.The analogy between a crypto-based proof-of-reserves audit, and that of an oilfield is not perfect.A dollar value is often assigned to an energy company's reserves by projecting out future cash flows and discounting them by 10%. For centralized crypto firms, marking the daily value of reserves to markets could be more straighforward.Oil reserves also require extraction, which creates the delineation between proved, probable, possible and other reserve categories; there's some degree of subjectivity when it comes to geological modeling tools and rock formations hundreds or thousands of feet below the ground. Proof-of-reserves for digital assets more closely resembles an audit of assets that have already been extracted.Finally, a natural lag exists in the auditing of energy reserves. The table above, while most recent, reflects U.S. energy reserves as of 2020.Proof-of-reserves can be executed far more frequently within crypto – maybe even weekly or daily or in real time. Certain exchanges have already gone as far as adopting daily attestation of crypto reserves.The differences could work to the crypto industry’s advantage, allowing exchange users and other observers to track assets precisely on an ongoing basis. Attestations may serve as a worthy beginning point for crypto that follows a sound process, rather than relying on the strength of personality to foster faith in a fledgling industry that still leaves most people feeling squirmy.",2022/11/14
403,"The Solana Foundation said Monday it has tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies stranded on FTX – as well as 3.24 million common stock shares in Sam Bankman-Fried’s bankrupt crypto exchange.In a blog post, the Foundation said it held 134.54 million SRM tokens and 3.43 million FTT tokens on FTX when withdrawals went dark on Nov. 6. Those assets are worth $29.3 million and $4.4 million, respectively, at current market prices per CoinGecko; they were worth around $107 million and $83 million one day before the freeze.Those holdings point to deep financial ties between Solana and FTX, which created the FTT token and held court over Serum, an on-chain crypto exchange that Bankman-Fried created and which was at the center of much of Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi).See also: FTX Hack Sparks Revolution at Serum DEX as Solana Devs Plot Alameda's OusterFTX’s collapse last week continues to reverberate through Solana, perhaps most acutely through its severe sell pressure on the price of SOL, which is down 57% in a week. But FTX’s role in managing infrastructure critical to Solana DeFi has caused a crisis for individual protocols, too.Many trading projects on Solana used wrapped assets called “Sollet assets” as stand-ins for bitcoin, ether and other non-native cryptocurrencies. FTX was believed to be the issuer and backer of these assets; its collapse has sent them into a spiral and shouldered a handful of protocols with bad debt.“The total exposure to Sollet-based assets on Solana in circulation is valued at approximately $40 million as of Nov 10, 2022. The status of the underlying assets is unknown at this time,” the blog post said.The Solana Foundation itself appears to have avoided the worst of the crisis. It held less than $1 million of its balance sheet on FTX when withdrawals ceased. “The impact on Solana Foundation operations is negligible,” the blog post said. It lost no SOL to FTX.Read more: Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried’s Crypto Empire Blur on His Trading Titan Alameda’s Balance SheetTrading funds, exchanges and crypto projects large and small have been disclosing their exposure to FTX and Alameda in light of the firms’ sudden downfall. FTX had loaned some $8 billion in customer deposits to its sister trading firm – a violation of its own terms of service. This created a hole in its balance sheet that ultimately led to its collapse last week.FTX’s former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was a key backer of Solana, a smart contracts platform whose native SOL token powers trades across various decentralized finance protocols – much like Ethereum and its “gas” token ETH.Bankman-Fried’s exchange and trading firm had purchased a total of 58,086,686 SOL tokens from the Foundation and sister entity Solana Labs from August 2020 onwards, the blog post said.

405,"Crypto funds saw their largest inflows in 14 weeks, with net inflows of $42 million in the seven days ended Nov. 11, according to a CoinShares report on Monday.The inflows coincided with the crypto market's sharp downturn, triggered by the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s business empire last week, including the FTX exchange and his Alameda Research trading firm.Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has fallen over 20% in the past seven days and was trading at about $16,400 Monday. The CoinDesk Market Index was up 0.8% in the past 24 hours.Despite the market downturn, the inflows could indicate that investors see “this price weakness as an opportunity” and are “differentiating between ‘trusted’ third parties and an inherently trustless system,” according to CoinShares.A key footnote to the data is that so-called short-bitcoin investment products – those betting on a price decline – saw $12.6 million in inflows.“While sentiment is predominantly positive, it has spooked some investors,” the report said.Investment products designed to bet on bitcoin gains saw $19 million in inflows last week, the largest since early August.Regionally, most inflows came from the U.S., at $29 million, followed by Brazil and Canada with $8 million and $4.3 million in inflows, respectively. Switzerland was the outlier, seeing $4.6 million in outflows last week, the report said.Multi-asset funds saw $8.4 million in inflows, the most since June, according to CoinShares.Meanwhile, blockchain-related equities saw their largest weekly outflow of $32 million since May, implying that “the more conservative investors in the asset class flew to safety.”",2022/11/14

It also renegotiated the collateral requirement to free up $5 million of bitcoin and extended the maturity until Dec. 29, the company said in a statement Monday. The miner paid down $12 million of equipment-backed term debt.Miners have suffered as the declining value of bitcoin has narrowed profit margins, making cash flow and debt obligations the key determinants of their survival.

One of the biggest hosting firms, Compute North, filed for bankruptcy in September.Bitfarms said it has raised $15 million through an at-the-market equity program since the start of the third quarter, and expects another $3.5 million of cash by year-end from the sale of a bitcoin mining site.The company lowered the cash cost of producing one bitcoin to $14,300 in the third quarter from $17,000 in the second. It reported a net loss of $85 million for the quarter, with its profit margin narrowing to 52%.Bitfarms sold 2,595 BTC for $56 million throughout the quarter.

407,"The world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance experienced record levels of bitcoin, ethereum and stablecoin withdrawals alongside the implosion of rival exchange FTX.Binance saw a net 81,712 bitcoin ($1.35 billion), or more than 15% of the roughly 500,000 bitcoin on its exchange, pulled from the platform over the past six days, according to data from CryptoQuant. In addition, a net 125,026 ether ($155 million) and $1.14 billion in stablecoins were withdrawn from Binance over the same period.Appearing on a Twitter space on Monday morning, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao appealed for calm, and said a ""slight"" uptick in the pace of withdrawals is normal when the prices of cryptocurrencies drop.The withdrawals are an industry-wide issue, with Coinglass showing nearly 200,000 bitcoin pulled from exchanges over the past seven days bringing the level of bitcoin held on exchanges down to 1.88 million. Coinbase (COIN), Gemini and Kraken are among the crypto brokers seeing percentage declines similar to Binance.The fast exits were prompted by the implosion of FTX, which was one of the largest exchanges before it filed for bankruptcy last week. Speculation over the company's financials mounted following a CoinDesk report that identified holes in the balance sheet of FTX sister company, Alameda Research. Customers scrambled to quickly withdraw funds from FTX, resulting in a liquidity crunch.Within days, FTX had seen its own bitcoin balance fall from about 20,000 to just one.Binance made an attempt to acquire FTX at the start of last week, signing a non-binding letter of intent only to walk away from a deal 24-hours later.Binance did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.",2022/11/14
408,"FTX’s U.S. derivatives-trading subsidiary – the former LedgerX – remains standing while other parts of Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire crumble, and that could be credited to its government oversight, said Rostin Behnam, chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).That part of the company, known now as FTX US Derivatives, has not been pulled into the bankruptcy filings of FTX’s U.S. operations.“The reason is because – I believe pretty strongly – that they are very clearly regulated by the CFTC,” Behnam said Monday at a Futures Industry Association (FIA) event in Chicago. “It's a testament to CFTC regulations and CFTC staff and the benefit of having clear, transparent rules.”The derivatives-trading operation had been registered with the CFTC well before it was acquired by FTX. Behnam said his agency has been in direct contact with the company and its custodial operations on a daily basis rather than the usual monthly reporting “to ensure member property is where it’s supposed to be.”“We’re pleased with where we are,” Behnam said. He added that “a lot remains to be seen over the next couple of days, weeks and months, but we’re being certainly vigilant.”FTX US Derivatives also became the focus of heavy attention in the past year when it applied to directly clear its customers’ margin-backed, crypto derivatives trades, which then-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried personally argued for during a roundtable in which he made the case that eliminating clearing firms was a viable future path. However, the application that once represented a major crypto industry foray into the territory of traditional financial firms has now been formally withdrawn.As for the CFTC’s enforcement powers, when Behnam was asked whether the agency would take action against FTX, he said he couldn’t comment on specific plans. However, he pointed out the CFTC does have authority over fraud and manipulation in the direct trading of crypto commodities, which would include bitcoin.“We will use that authority to the full extent of the law,” Behnam said.This latest crypto crisis also underlines the need for Congress to move quickly to establish regulatory controls, the chairman argued.“We don't have the luxury of time anymore,” he said.",2022/11/14
409,"In my latest conversations with private clients, the number one question I get asked is about tax loss harvesting (TLH). TLH is best thought of as purposefully selling an investment you bought that is currently below your purchase price to lock in a capital loss on your taxes.Due to bitcoin’s regulatory classifications, there is a unique way to take advantage of tax loss harvesting that isn't possible with equities! One quick note, the following discussion of TLH strategy is solely based on U.S. tax laws, and this practice may or may not be possible in other jurisdictions.Steven Lubka, a CoinDesk columnist, leads Swan Private, Swan Bitcoin's concierge service for high-net worth investors. This article is part of Tax Week.Additionally, this does not constitute advice, and make sure to talk with your own CPA [certified public accountant] before making any tax decisions!In the stock market, if you sell an equity and repurchase a similar instrument within 30 days any loss generated from the sale will be disallowed, meaning you can't use the loss to offset any other capital gains. This rule also applies in reverse.This is due to something called the wash sale rule, however, the wash sale rule only applies to securities. Bitcoin is classified as “property” under the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax code and is exempt from the wash sale rule.What this allows you to do is instantly sell and repurchase your bitcoin in order to lock in tax benefits. This is important because most investors don’t actually want to sell their bitcoin at these prices, they want to hold their bitcoin for its eventual recovery.Selling bitcoin and having to wait over 30 days to buy it back could cause investors to miss out on a substantial price increase if it was done at the wrong time. This is why bitcoin’s tax classifications allow for a unique approach to managing any unrealized capital loss you may have on your bitcoin position.See also: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022 During the time I have managed the Swan Private team for Swan Bitcoin, we have helped investors perform hundreds of tax loss harvest transactions while prices have been low, generating highly meaningful tax savings.So why should you lock in a capital loss? Capital losses are a versatile tax tool that can help you save a significant amount of money on your EOY [end of year] tax obligations. There are two main ways a capital loss can help you, and one important detail to be aware of.What happens if you don’t have enough eligible capital gains and ordinary income to use your entire capital loss? You can actually roll forward the capital loss to the next year – indefinitely. This means that even if you don't expect capital gains this year, but know you will have some capital gains in a future year, you can still take advantage of any capital losses this year to mitigate future tax events.On a basic level, all that is required is a sale and repurchase of the bitcoin position. However, there are several other considerations to keep in mind.Bitcoin investors can select three different accounting treatments for their bitcoin. These are Specific ID (HIFO, or highest in, first out), last-in first-out (LIFO), and first-in first-out (FIFO). Each of these methods refers to the question of “which” bitcoin was sold when an investor sells BTC.For example, if someone had purchased 1 BTC on two different occasions and they then sell a bitcoin - which bitcoin was it that they sold? The one they bought at $10,000 or the one they bought at $60,000. You can see this obviously makes a big difference.Generally, the reason most people would take advantage of performing a TLH transaction is that they have some portion of their total bitcoin which is down more than 20%. Someone who is sitting on an unrealized capital loss of this magnitude or more, and who expects capital gains at some point in the future could benefit from taking advantage of the current low prices to lock in tax benefits for this year, or future years.See also: Crypto Capital Gains and Tax Rates 2022 | (February)Even if you don’t expect much in terms of capital gains anytime soon, the income deduction could also be one reason to perform a TLH transaction. This is particularly relevant for people who plan to hold their bitcoin for a long time, and potentially borrow against the bitcoin in the future instead of selling it.If your goal is to sell your bitcoin quickly for a profit, you will end up resetting your cost basis when you do a TLH transaction which will net out any benefits accrued. However, if you have a longer investment timeline locking in losses today can be a good idea.",2022/11/14

411,"I’m not going to mince words. The fraud-driven collapse of FTX and Alameda Research is, in my estimation, the worst single event in the crypto industry since its inception.Even though as a share of overall crypto market cap the impact may have been less in relative terms than Mt. Gox was, the fallout will be more significant. For one, no one really thought of Gox as a particularly credible institution. It wasn't “institutional” in any way.Mark Karpeles, who was the CEO of Mt. Gox, didn’t go on a charm offensive in Washington, D.C., to win favor from politicians. Mt. Gox didn’t air Super Bowl ads. Celebrities didn’t line up to endorse the platform. And crucially, the number of users worldwide were much fewer.CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.FTX, by contrast, served millions of users worldwide. It catered to numerous funds, institutions and startups. It was aggressive in promoting itself to mainstream users. Its enigmatic CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, practically lived in Washington, charming members of Congress and financial regulators. The exchange was widely considered one of the most trusted and credible institutions in the industry. The apparent fraud and collapse was therefore particularly catastrophic, because it happened so quickly and took almost everyone by surprise.The fallout will linger for years. Silver linings are few. I will admit to having breathed a sigh of relief at SBF’s discrediting. His agenda was fundamentally hostile to DeFi (decentralized finance); his interests seemed to extend only to obtaining a regulatory baptism for his firm and no one else. He was an unrepresentative and non-aligned ambassador in Washington, and I’m glad he will no longer be representing us in policy conversations.The other considerable bright spot to emerge from this mess is the renewed industry interest in proofs of reserve. The more serious among us have been contemplating how we can win back trust among end users and regulators. Some in Washington will naturally call for exchanges to be more heavily regulated, under the guise of consumer protection. Some crypto natives are redoubling their efforts on DeFi and DEXs (decentralized exchanges), considering CeFi (centralized finance) to be a lost cause. And Bitcoin maxis are bleating to no one in particular about how all centralized institutions are frauds.None of those three approaches makes sense to me. Bitcoin preachers will never convince everyone to adopt a rigorous self-custodial setup. There are no indications whatsoever of their imminent glorious hyper-bitcoinized, non-intermediated future. Centralized custodians, lenders and exchanges have existed for over a decade and will continue to be useful and necessary. This is not out of step with a core Bitcoin ethos either – software developer Hal Finney famously advocated for a “free banking” approach to Bitcoin.Listen: NLW – Why Proof-of-Reserves NowThe pro-regulatory crowd would throw the baby out with the bathwater. A crypto industry that replicates the legacy banking sector would achieve little. It’s critical we do everything to preserve the interoperability of the crypto sector and eliminate barriers to entry and regulatory capture. Elevating a handful of centralized exchanges and raising barriers to entry for competitors, as SBF sought to do, would make it far easier for regulators to capture the entire industry by tightly managing a few choke points.And lastly the DeFi- and DEXs-only crowd misses the mark. Pure DeFi isn’t without reproach – Terra/LUNA could, for instance, be called DeFi. Hacks and rugpulls are plentiful. And, of course, DeFi users need to hold their assets in self-custody, which, while being the premise of DeFi, is a nonstarter for the vast majority of people.The fact is, while the average user should have the ability to withdraw funds and transact with them outside of an intermediated system, most users won't choose to do that. We can admit the reality that many users will always prefer intermediation, while pushing to improve the quality of these intermediaries.That’s where proof of reserve comes in. Proofs of reserve harmonize the innate transparency of blockchains with the convenience of centralized custodians. The procedure generally refers to a demonstration undertaken by exchanges proving that they possess client assets to match outstanding liabilities.There was a minor wave of proof of reserve enthusiasm post-Gox, which immediately fizzled out, and a slight renaissance starting summer 2021 with BitMEX’s proof of reserves and liabilities, followed by Kraken’s effort this past February. Things didn’t move very fast thereafter, despite my ardent lobbying. Reform must wait for a crisis, it appears.Post-FTX, a new enthusiasm for proofs of reserve has emerged. A number of exchanges – at a minimum Binance, Gate.io, KuCoin, Poloniex, Bitget, Huobi, OKX, Deribit and Bybit – have indicated their attention to publish proofs of reserve. A few such as Crypto.com, Bitfinex and Binance have taken the intermediate step of releasing wallet addresses as a crude proof of assets. But this is incomplete without corresponding liabilities.The asset side is trivial: It can involve publishing wallet addresses or signing a transaction. The tricky part is matching the assets with the outstanding liabilities. To achieve that, an exchange adds up all user balances, anonymizes them and publishes the data in Merkelized format. From there, depositors can verify that they are included in the liability set. If enough do this, they can have strong confidence that the exchange isn’t cheating by omitting liabilities. And if the process happens under the eye of an auditor, users can gain additional assurance that no liabilities are being excluded.Read more: George Kaloudis – All Custodial Crypto Exchanges Should Adopt Proof-of-Reserve Programs, but Even That Isn’t EnoughCynics and Bitcoin maxis tend to protest that proofs of reserve aren’t perfectly trustless. Of course, there aren't – nothing is – but critics would sacrifice the perfect at the altar of the good. There has been a brouhaha in recent days about major exchanges engaging in asset snapshots with purportedly borrowed funds, and many are using this to write off proofs of reserve entirely. (Some of these accusations were later shown to be unfounded.) Writing off proofs of reserve because some weak implementations weren’t credible is the equivalent of ordering Little Caesars pizza and assuming all Italian food is garbage.A point-in-time asset snapshot without the supervision of an auditor or a cash-flow analysis proves very little. The proofs of reserve I and others talk about involves ongoing, frequent attestations, ideally supervised by an auditor. In its more complete form, it provides very strong assurances.Recalcitrant exchanges have few excuses left. Compared with the first rush for proofs of reserve in 2014/15, there are far more resources available today. The 2021 practitioner’s guide to proof of reserve, published by myself and a few other collaborators by the Digital Chamber, offers a full picture.The BitMEX proofs of reserve open-source code and a guide to replicating the procedure is available. And to the critics who bemoan the lack of accounting firms with expertise in facilitating the process – that is no longer true. Top 20 audit firm Armanino has been undertaking these engagements for years, and it isn't the only one.During a bull market, I can understand why exchanges wouldn't bother competing based on credibility. But in a time of consolidation, retaining user trust is absolutely vital. This procedure allows exchanges to be far more transparent than their TradFi counterparts that cannot independently verify user assets held.Regulators, I expect, will come to demand it. Already proofs of reserve received a mention in Wyoming’s SPDI (special purpose depository institution) rules, and I imagine it will appear in more legislation soon.Read more: David Z. Morris – Nic Carter vs. The Bitcoin MaximalistsNow with so many exchanges – including market leader Binance – embracing the procedure, the few not participating will raise eyebrows. When pressed, Coinbase’s Emilie Choi protested that the exchange is already audited and that this should be a sufficient substitute. But if Coinbase cares about the integrity of the industry, it will undertake the procedure anyway. I would much rather depositors have the option to choose between a variety of public and non-public exchanges, all doing PoR, rather than being limited to a handful of public exchanges doing quarterly disclosures through the Securities and Exchange Commission.Let’s be clear. A proof of reserve wouldn’t have “stopped” FTX, Quadriga or Mt. Gox. All three were insolvent for long periods of time because of either fraud or hacks. But in a world where proofs of reserve become the norm, their refusal or inability to perform a proof of reserve would have stuck out like a sore thumb and alerted users that something was likely awry. So proofs of reserve, at the industry scale, works via negativa – it’s most telling if you don’t do it.In the next few months and years, as proofs of reserve become more common throughout the industry, I hope and expect that we will apply the same scrutiny to the remaining holdouts.",2022/11/14

414,"The collapse of FTX and Alameda has sparked another round of deleveraging in crypto markets, and that’s likely to spur more “crypto quantitative tightening,” Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a research report Friday.Creditors are selling digital assets to cover their risks, adding to market volatility, and are likely to reveal their exposures in the next few weeks. The spillover to equity markets so far is limited because crypto firms mainly lend to each other, the report said.Morgan Stanley says many events have led to the latest bout of volatility in the crypto market, but the key question is “how to value crypto tokens that offer a service but don’t offer the token holder a stake in the company (like equity) or a claim on assets in the case of a default (like debt.)”In a bull market using such a token as collateral to leverage seems fine, but the strategy is risky in a bear market, the bank added.The bear market in bitcoin started almost a year ago and it has been mainly institutions who have been selling, the note said. Retail investors are still holding on to their positions.With bitcoin (BTC) now trading under $18,000, there isn’t a clear technical support level before $12,500, the bank said. It estimates that anyone that bought or received BTC in the past 12-18 months has an average breakeven price of around $45,000.“Retail investors may start to sell if BTC trades below $10,000,” it added.Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending is proving to be resilient at the moment, as it was in June following the Terra/LUNA collapse, because it is over collateralized. “CeFi lending is where there were problems,” the note added.DeFi is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on blockchains.Read more: JPMorgan Sees Wave of Crypto Deleveraging From FTX’s Woes",2022/11/14

416,"Bitcoin (BTC) miners or entities generating the cryptocurrency seem to be running down their coin stash amid the FTX-induced market panic.In the past seven days, the balance held in miner wallets has declined by 9,402 BTC to a ten-month low of 1.826 million BTC ($30.6 billion), according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.The miner net position change, or the 30-day change of BTC supply held in miner addresses, slipped to -10,972 BTC on Thursday, the lowest since early January.Bitcoin miners solve complex algorithmic problems to mine blocks and verify transactions in return for rewards paid in BTC. In other words, the miner profitability is heavily dependent on the cryptocurrency's price. Therefore, miners tend to run down their inventory in a bleeding market to stay afloat.Bitcoin fell by 22% in the seven days to Nov. 13, its biggest decline since June, as the collapse of Sam Bankman Fried's FTX exchange dented investor confidence and triggered contagion fears.The sell-off could continue in the days ahead, analysts told CoinDesk. That would worsen the situation for miners, who have been facing high operational costs.""Bitcoin mining companies have struggled this year, with the fall in the price of the largest cryptocurrency and rising energy prices (and operating costs) leading to a decline in revenue. As a result of this, mining firms have been heavily selling their underlying holdings, leading to significant net outflows over the last six months,"" data provider CryptoCompare said in the October review.Charles Edwards, CEO of asset manager Capriole, recently voiced a similar opinion on Twitter, saying, ""bitcoin's electrical cost has just been breached for the 2nd time only in 5 years. The electrical bill for the average miner is now greater than the income earnt.""""Many Bitcoin miners are now turning their rigs off,"" Edwards added.According to Blockware Solutions, a continued BTC price slide toward $15,000, would not necessarily see miners immediately turn of their machines.""Many miners have PPAs [power purchase agreements] and hosting contracts that require them to consume energy or potentially pay an additional fee.

Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Last week's calamitous collapse of the FTX exchange sent crypto markets for their worst seven-day stretch since the mid-June aftermath of the Terra blockchain's meltdown. A giant hack over the weekend just made things worse.

And sign up for First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.It goes without saying that last week's collapse of the FTX exchange represents one of the crypto industry's worst-ever episodes, clearly reflected in digital-asset markets: The price of bellwether bitcoin (BTC) tumbled 22% in the seven days through Sunday, its worst weekly performance since mid-June, when traders were grappling with the aftermath of the Terra blockchain's collapse. (Here's a timeline of key FTX developments, showing how the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) of 162 digital assets traded through it all.)Things got incrementally worse over the weekend when FTX and its U.S. subsidiary, FTX US, became victims of an attack that drained hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto out of the exchanges' wallets. The crypto exchanges Binance and Huobi scrambled to block deposits of FTT, FTX's native tokens, after about $400 million of the tokens were unexpectedly released out of schedule, with no official explanation. The stablecoin issuer Tether blocked addresses tied to the FTX account drainer's wallets.Crypto analysts are assessing what comes next for ailing digital-asset markets and policy ramifications for the reputation-wounded blockchain industry. Researchers at Coinbase Institutional say bitcoin, currently around $16,236, might be looking at a further price drop, possibly as low as $13,500.One industry reform seems to be gaining momentum: Centralized crypto exchanges are being pushed to provide proof of reserves. It may take a lot more than that, and perhaps months, before the industry starts to regain public confidence. The widely-monitored Crypto Fear & Greed Index is signaling ""extreme fear.""""Even though BTC has settled around $16,000 for now, the extent of the damage to other companies, funds, exchanges is as yet unknown, and may come to the fore in the weeks to come,"" said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the crypto hedge fund BitBull Capital. ""We remain cautious until the current situation is satisfactorily resolved and sentiment appears to start moving toward relative normalcy.""By Sam ReynoldsThe SEC is keeping emails and notes that led to one of the most important speeches in crypto’s history secret from CoinDesk.In 2018, William Hinman, the then-Director of Corporation Finance at the SEC Commission, gave a speech at the Yahoo Markets Summit that proved to be a watershed moment for crypto: Ether is not a security.Ether, Hinman said at the time, had become “sufficiently decentralized” and thus moved past its nebulous status of security-not-a-security to commodity.“Based on my understanding of the present state of ether, the Ethereum network, and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions,” a copy of the speech reads. “Purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts.”Ripple has taken great interest in this as they were sued in December 2020 by the SEC on the basis that they were offering unregistered securities via an initial coin offering. Ripple filed suit against the SEC requesting drafts of the speech along with internal notes and received a favorable ruling in January 2022.In late September, Ripple received a huge win in its case when a U.S. judge told the SEC to release emails and other correspondence. “I can say that it was well worth the fight to get them,” Ripple’s General Counsel Stu Alderoty tweeted.But these remain confidential. CoinDesk attempted a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain these documents, but the 71 documents that were sent were heavily redacted.The SEC said that it was unable to release the unredacted documents as they were “prepared in anticipation of litigation, forms an integral part of the pre-decisional process, and/or contains advice given to the Commission or senior staff by the Commission’s attorneys.”It also noted that the release of the documents would constitute an “unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”What is visible is a massive email thread that took place over the course of two weeks where drafts of the speech were shopped around the Commission.A whole cast of characters from the SEC weighed in, including Jay Clayton, the then SEC chair, Lucas Moskowitz, its former chief of staff, David Fredrickson, a senior legal advisor, Jennifer McHugh, an acting associate director of the Disclosure Review, as well as Valerie Szczepanik, head of its strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology.We don’t know what was said in this email chain, but there certainly was a lot of input from the Commission. Fredrickson, in his role as legal advisor, made some edits. Szczepanik also weighed in along with McHugh.The input from senior Commission staff might undermine the argument that Hinman’s speech was his own opinion and “not necessarily that of the Commission.” The SEC wants the market to think that this speech wasn’t guidance, but it sure looks like the SEC provided a lot of guidance in its drafting.In an earlier interview with CoinDesk during Singapore FinTech Week, Alderoty, Ripple’s counsel, called the SEC’s current approach to crypto a failure that runs the risk of driving the digital assets industry offshore as there’s no “clear regulatory framework”. In Fortune, he wrote that Hinman’s talk was ‘the speech that muddied the crypto waters’.“It has not provided clarity, and it's pushing innovation offshore to other economic centers like Singapore. And it's hurting the very retail consumer in the U.S. that the SEC is supposed to protect,” he said. “If the US gets this wrong, they're going to lose their position as a leader in this new financial economy.”The case between Ripple and the SEC will likely be drawing to a close early next year (there were court dates planned for November, but extensions were granted).Alderoty seems happy with the version of documents the SEC provided him.

421,"Democrats have retained control of the U.S. Senate following the midterm elections. Although a number of pro-crypto candidates from both sides are in, crypto exchange FTX’s fresh collapse will likely spell more regulations for the space.The result was called on Sunday, five days after the elections were held, with election officials still counting votes for several members of the House of Representatives. It is not yet clear which party will control the lower body of Congress.It’s also unclear how much the election outcome could sway crypto legislation already in the works, as the laws have had bipartisan support and the key lawmakers behind the initiatives remain in office. The crypto industry made a concerted effort to make its mark on Capitol Hill this year, and a number of proponents from both parties have won their respective races.But the market could be a wild card.On the day of the election, Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX, made a surprise announcement on Twitter that rival platform Binance had signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire FTX. In the days that followed, the deal was scrapped and the once multi-billion dollar exchange filed for bankruptcy on Friday. Over the weekend, FTX and FTX US were hacked with $600 million worth of crypto moved off the exchange.Crypto prices across the board took a nosedive following the news, with bitcoin price dropping 22% in the last seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data on Sunday.Bankman-Fried, who said he had spent much of his time talking to lawmakers and regulators in D.C. these last months, may still influence crypto rules, but not in the way he might have intended.Several key Senators within the Democratic Party have expressed concern over the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which was led by major election donor Sam Bankman-Fried. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who will continue to chair the Senate Banking Committee, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who sits on that committee, have both called for investigations into the exchange.Read more: Crypto Has Prepared for Divided US Government, Republican Rise",2022/11/13
422,"Last week FTX, once the third-largest crypto exchange by volume, owned and run by founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), went through a meltdown. Here’s how that went down:You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.I think it’s more accurate to attribute FTX’s fall to a “solvency issue” rather than a “liquidity scare” (which just means FTX owed people some money and it couldn’t pay). But that doesn’t really matter because this potential purchase was subject to a due diligence process.The market, unsurprisingly, was puking everywhere as it grappled with sparse details as events unfolded in real time. Binance ultimately pulled out of the deal because FTX’s issue were ""beyond [Binance’s] control or ability to help.""A crude description of what this means is that FTX would be unable to satisfy customer withdrawal requests for the funds stored on its platform because FTX had been doing all sorts of things with those deposited funds and those things turned out to be bad for the value of the deposited funds. Now, this is a relatively normal practice. Even your local credit union does things with funds you deposit with them; “doing stuff” wasn’t FTX’s transgression.By way of example, when you deposit money into a bank account, the bank lends your money out to other customers who want to buy cars, houses or a new gaming rig in exchange for an interest rate. Some banks do more exotic things, like allow customers to put up collateral (like a stock, bond or cash) to borrow some other asset to trade it. Herein lies FTX’s transgression.FTX was doing that. It allowed customers to borrow things like bitcoin for cash to make trading bets. That’s all fine and dandy as long as FTX manages risk responsibly (whatever that means) and is transparent with its customers (much clearer, just tell customers everything).Where FTX went wrong, besides the lack of transparency, was behavior regarding FTT, its native crypto token. FTT is like an equity stake in FTX itself, because every so often FTX uses its profits to buy some FTT off the open market (which should increase FTT’s price because of supply and demand). Customers were allowed to deposit FTT with FTX and use that as collateral to borrow other crypto assets or cash to make trading bets.Now it’s not immediately obvious but this is an awful idea. Here’s why:If the health of FTX is even remotely questioned (like how a company with the same founder in the same industry has a funny-looking balance sheet), then its equity (or things that are sort of equity) loses value. And if FTX is holding a lot of FTT on behalf of customers who are making trading bets, then that FTT is less valuable collateral, which means that the health of FTX degrades, which means FTT would lose value.And so on and so forth.You know what this sounds like? Yeah, it sounds like how roughly $60 billion of value evaporated basically overnight in May 2022 with the collapse of Terra.Dizzy yet? Me, too. Let’s pause for a moment.I’m not sure about you, but this sounds like something else I’ve heard about before. That is: What was happening in the leadup to the Great Financial Crisis in 2007 when financial institutions were doing all sorts of exotic things with mortgages, and taking trading bets on the performance of those mortgages.So given the insistence of crypto-natives to avoid the failings of traditional finance (TradFi), what has the reaction been from people in the industry?One of the more reasonable calls to action has been the urging for cryptocurrency exchanges to implement “proof-of-reserves” to combat the huge loss in credibility the collective body of cryptocurrency exchanges just felt.Proof-of-reserves is basically a fancy way of saying: “Hey, here’s proof that we have what we say we have.”A very simple example: Let’s say you have 1 bitcoin that you bought on an exchange called “Shh! Just Trust George” and you leave it there for the exchange to take care of it on your behalf. For all intents and purposes, that 1 bitcoin is your bitcoin; Shh! Just Trust George is just holding it for you. Because of the transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain, there should exist some proof (cryptographic or whatever) that Shh! Just Trust George does in fact have your 1 bitcoin in its reserve.From a finance-talk perspective, Shh! Just Trust George should be able to easily prove that its assets, the bitcoin it holds, match up with its liabilities, the promise that Shh! Just Trust George will give a customer their bitcoins when they ask for them.Some proponents, like CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter, have been urging cryptocurrency exchanges to implement this for a while. Some have, like Kraken and BitMEX, and since the FTX-and-related meltdown the likes of Binance, OKX, KuCoin, Poloniex and Huobi have all promised to issue a proof-of-reserves attestation (or similar) in the coming days, weeks or months.Papering over some technological details, there’s a way to use Merkle trees, which are data structures used in bitcoin, to do this in a sleek and cost-effective way. I think this is great. We should aspire for more transparency in our financial services, and proof-of-reserves could provide that.But there’s a missing piece to the practical implementation of proof-of-reserves that enterprising readers might recognize as a potential flaw. In practice there will likely also have to be a third-party auditor hired to attest to the proof-of-reserves (as Kraken has).You might see where this is going … more third parties, more potential centralizing choke points. So while implementing proof-of-reserves is a massive step in the right direction, it is certainly still not enough.Here are two of the (potentially many) reasons why we need more than proof-of-reserves from crypto exchanges:So human fallibility can still upend proof-of-reserves. Somehow the hefty financial rewards that come with the financial shenanigans needs to be outweighed.Here, though, are some shreds of hope.Modern finance has consistently seen busts that are worse than the booms that preceded them. And the busts have hurt enough people in a short enough timespan that these people will demand more clarity and transparency going forward. If customers don’t, the policymakers will be sure to try to make that happen (even though it hasn’t really been successful so far yet).On top of that, at risk of sounding like a Luddite, I also think consumers are wising up to one of the problems with contemporary business: complexity. Sure, without complicated things we wouldn’t have, say, circuit boards. But there’s a glut of companies, businesses, movements and jobs that can’t be simply explained anymore. That’s a problem for transparency, whatever the protagonists’ intentions.So, after a week of dizzying revelations involving a once-heralded new business of the New Era, I leave you with one simple idea: Let’s get back to the basics.",2022/11/13
423,"Trading volume on Coinbase plunged roughly 75% in the hours following FTX’s bankruptcy announcement early Friday, according to data from Nomics, a sign the company is beginning to feel the pain from crypto investors shrinking from the increasingly volatile cryptocurrency market.FTX’s Chapter 11 filing is the latest in a wave of high-profile exchange bankruptcies that have sent the crypto industry into freefall and prompted investors to reevaluate whether to trade cryptocurrencies at all, said Dan Dolev, a senior analyst at Mizuho.""For many investors, if you didn't read the writing on the wall for the last two events in this industry, it's basically that there's no bottom… this is [ investors'] last and final wake up call,” said Dolev.It’s a reckoning that could hurt Coinbase’s bottom line.Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. by trading volume, reaps 90% of its revenue from the sizable transaction fees it charges its user base of mostly newer investors who don’t trade frequently, a revenue model that requires the company to continually replenish its user base.But as FTX’s implosion batters investor confidence in the digital asset industry, onboarding new users may prove a difficult task. That’s a challenge the exchange will have to overcome to take advantage of its increasingly narrow field of competitors, one of the few silver linings of the bear-market crypto shakeout.Coinbase has cultivated a reputation as a safer alternative to fast-and-loose Binance and FTX, a reputation by its going public in 2017.It’s a point of comparison the company has harped on as it reassures investors that it remains largely insulated from FTX’s implosion.“I think it's important to reinforce what differentiates Coinbase in a moment like this,” wrote Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in a Tuesday Twitter thread. “Coinbase has always strived to be the most trusted player in the space, and we don't engage in this type of risky activity.”But the company’s decision to market itself primarily towards new traders and the crypto-curious may hamper its ability to grow as the market meltdown spooks less experienced traders and short-term crypto holders, says Lisa Ellis, Senior Equity Analyst at MoffettNathanson LLC.“When prices are low and you're in a crypto winter, a lot of those retail investors kind of go into hibernation,” said Ellis.Many new traders flocked to platforms like Coinbase during the pandemic, when inflation was low and government spending was high. At that time, investors’ rush to embrace digital assets catapulted crypto token prices to new highs too. In November 2021, bitcoin’s price peaked at just over $69,000.But the ongoing crypto winter and then FTX’s implosion earlier this week has sent prices spiraling, meaning many Coinbase users will be less likely to trade. On Wednesday, following news that Binance had pulled out its deal to rescue FTX, bitcoin dipped below $16,000 for the first time in two years.But there is a silver lining, according to Chris Brendler, an analyst at D.A. Davidson Company. Coinbase’s status as a public company may help the firm win over some new customers as FTX users who were blindsided by that firm’s sudden collapse come to embrace Coinbase, which is legally required to submit itself to rigorous audits and publish reports on its financial health.“I would not be surprised if Coinbase picks up market share here,” said Brendler.Read more: US-Listed Crypto Trading Platforms Coinbase, Bakkt Gain After FTX Bankruptcy Filing",2022/11/12
424,"Elon Musk didn’t waste any time jumping into the Twitter fray after an apparent hack of bankrupt crypto lender FTX drained hundreds of millions of dollars from company-controlled wallets.Just a couple of hours after the apparent hack began late Friday night, Musk tweeted “FTX meltdown/ransack being tracked in real-time on Twitter.” He also responded to a post by crypto entrepreneur Sam Altman with a raunchy meme of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.Around 2:30 am EST on Saturday morning, Musk joined a Twitter Space with over 60,000 listeners to discuss the hack of FTX and share his thoughts on Bankman-Fried.“To be honest, I’d never heard of him,” Musk said. “But then I got a ton of people telling me [that] he’s got, you know, huge amounts of money that he wants to invest in the Twitter deal. And I talked to him for about half an hour. And I know my bulls**t meter was redlining. It was like, this dude is bulls**t – that was my impression.”“Then I was like, man, everyone including major investment banks – everyone was talking about him like he’s walking on water and has a zillion dollars. And that [was] not my impression…that dude is just – there’s something wrong, and he does not have capital, and he will not come through. That was my prediction,” Musk added.Musk also told listeners that they should keep their crypto in cold wallets, not in exchanges.“I would reaffirm that, if you have crypto, you should have it in a directly-accessible cold wallet. Not in an exchange,” Musk said. “That would be wise.”The spectacular collapse of FTX – until this week one of the largest and seemingly most regulated exchanges in the world – hasn’t turned Musk off crypto as a whole.“I think there probably is a future for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DOGE. I can’t really speak to the others. But if you’ve got one of those three in a cold wallet, and off an exchange, I think my guess is it works out well,” he said.",2022/11/12

FTX’s FTT token recently plunged more than 30% to approach its low perch from earlier in the week.As CoinDesk reported, the Solana blockchain’s SOL token, one of the hardest-hit digital assets this week, slid nearly 12%. SOL’s decline stemmed from speculation about Solana’s close connection to Alameda Research, a trading firm that was founded by FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.

A new generation of ardent bitcoin maximalists will be born from FTX's implosion.During the summer of 2022, controversy struck the Bitcoin community regarding toxic maximalism: Partner at Castle Island Ventures (and CoinDesk columnist) Nic Carter (then a vocal bitcoin supporter) had participated in an investment in a Web3 wallet company, and was called out for building beyond bitcoin.In response to his critics, Carter wrote a lengthy Medium article in which he distanced himself from the bitcoin maximalist community: “I am not a “bitcoin maximalist, I have never been one, I will never be one.” Entering and exiting the bitcoin community is voluntary, but on his way out Carter showed maybe he never understood bitcoin’s “toxicity.”Bitcoiners certainly take up a few unapologetic, uncompromising stances. Tomer Strolight, editor in chief at Swan Bitcoin, has argued that bitcoin maximalists’ perceived toxicity is really just principled opposition. When maximalists criticize centralized crypto exchanges, curse the altcoin ecosystem or call creators of new tokens scam artists, they are actually working to uphold the integrity of the Bitcoin network.Read more: The Collapse of the FTX Empire For these views, bitcoiners have been called parochial. For instance, Stephan Livera, managing director of Swan Bitcoin, wrote in Bitcoin Magazine that maximalists are often criticized for not “understanding” the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This is incorrect because bitcoiners (many of them former “crypto” advocates) understand blockchains only too well.There are technological limits to what blockchains can achieve, social contagions in crypto that foment scams and economic principles such as creating a viable alternative to fiat currencies at play. Bitcoiners think bitcoin eventually will become the next global reserve asset – and so can argue in good faith that playing with other cryptocurrencies or trusting one’s BTC to a third-party is a waste of one’s time at best and a dangerous risk at worst.This hardline stance certainly looks good today because the broader crypto industry is facing its “Lehman moment.” Bitcoin maximalists are entirely correct that if all you did was buy bitcoin and store it in a hard wallet you would have placed yourself completely outside of FTX’s economic blast radius.Read more: It’s Time to End Maximalism in Crypto / OpinionOne may quibble over bitcoin maximalists’ choice of words (like the vulgar term for a supposedly scat-related coin) but perhaps they have been strident for a reason. From their perspective, altcoins and “easy” crypto rewards have always had zero value, and the people selling you them have always been snake oil salesmen. Crypto calamities are always around the corner, and bitcoiners are only trying to warn others.Many crypto enthusiasts who are suffering due to FTX’s implosion are likely to take a second look at all of the “toxic” messaging that bitcoin maximalists have been shouting from the rooftops. It could begin with a simple question. Were the maximalists right?They will begin their journey anew, assuming they do not exit crypto entirely, no longer so susceptible to crypto scams. But if they keep an open mind, and try to return to the principles of decentralization, self-custody and self-reliance, they will find that bitcoin is unique.It’s not just bitcoin’s origin story – the first “cryptocurrency” was founded by a pseudonymous developer who launched the network fairly and stepped away from his vast trove of tokens earned just like anyone else – that sets it apart. But also, what Bitcoin has become: A decentralized financial network that anyone can use, that’s governed transparently by predetermined rules and that no one can shut down. What is crypto in comparison?Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried No Longer a Billionaire After $14.6B Wipeout: BloombergWell, crypto is Sam Bankman-Fried: a (former) billionaire who lied to investors and his own users. Crypto is FTX: an underfunded exchange that provided little social or economic value even when it was in operation, that people trusted. Crypto is Alameda Research: a hedge fund that in all probability traded against FTX users, backed dubious projects and had a hole so big in its balance sheet it swallowed the crypto industry.The new generation of ardent bitcoin maximalists born from FTX’s ashes will, in time, hold their bitcoin keys on their own wallets (perhaps a Trezor or Ledger) and they will not be susceptible to Ponzi schemes propped up by the reputation of whoever the next paper billionaire with his/her own coin.The pain felt right now is real. The feeling of having been deceived must be unbearable. But know that whatever shame, guilt, anger, depression or rage you have ties back to one source. Bankman-Fried got away with his lies for so long because “crypto” itself is built on a lie: What calls itself a revolution is really just the fiat system par excellence. Satoshi Nakamoto started a new network that makes double-counting impossible because everyone has the same view of what’s going on. It exists, while crypto can vanish.This is the free market in action: Mistakes are punished and correct choices are rewarded.

428,"What a week.The bankruptcy of one-time crypto industry powerhouse FTX represents the latest unsavory chapter in an industry regularly rocked by crises.Yet, cryptocurrencies have historically rebounded to new heights following each calamity. What doesn’t wipe out blockchain and other crypto ventures makes them stronger as new fortified iterations of themselves.Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has weathered a range of big setbacks, including Mt. Gox, other bankruptcies, security breaches and macroeconomic uncertainties. BTC was most recently trading just under $17,000 after falling below $16,000 earlier in the week for the first time in two years. Its current level puts it within range of its previous high water mark during the crypto bull market of late 2017.How do markets recover from crypto’s latest black eye? To continue a boxing analogy, we’re still in the early post-apocalyptic rounds. Let’s consider a couple of constants.The tenets of supply and demand remain in bitcoin and post-Merge ether’s favor. The volume of each is limited and the public, increasingly including institutional investors, remains robust.But price direction among other cryptocurrencies is uncertain, subject to many different factors including protocols’ ability to execute on their strategies and engage the public.Separately, an improving economy, a more settled socio-political landscape and clearer crypto regulation in some combination would likely buoy markets. A fresh debacle and sudden economic reversal from the current encouraging signs would likely lead to a downturn and renewed doubts about crypto’s future.MacroeconomicsMarkets received positive news this week, with CoinDesk reporting U.S. consumer prices rose slower than projected for October. The overhang of inflation and the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) efforts to quell its advance has been an ongoing theme.To be sure, economic challenges still exist. For instance, the spread between the yields for the 10- and two-year U.S. Treasury bonds remains negative. The inversion of this yield curve, which has been present since July, has historically been a predictor of economic recessions.But the FOMC remains fully committed to fighting inflation, the biggest long-range threat to the U.S. economy. And the economic landscape appears to be stabilizing, or at least avoiding market moving surprises.Technical levelsTo say that BTC and ETH have been oversold as FTX has disintegrated is an understatement. Yet, investors should not see this trend as a clarion call to buy, particularly as prices have rebounded over the past couple of days and are not as oversold.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for BTC and ETH is 35 and 40, respectively. RSI levels under 30 are generally a signal that an asset’s price is undervalued.Based on past data, BTC and ETH’s RSI levels don’t imply much movement over the next 30 days.Since 2015, BTC’s RSI has fallen between 30 and 50 on 1,005 occasions. Since 2017, ETH’s RSI has maintained the same range 682 times.The average 30-day performance following those occurrences since that time has been -1.1% for ETH and 3.03% for BTC.Bitcoin and ether’s respective $20,000 and $1,300 support levels of a week ago will now likely represent resistance.On-chain dataOn-chain data shows a decline in BTC and ETH transferred to centralized exchanges following a spike on Nov. 9.This bears watching because coins are often sent to exchanges prior to offloading. Historical data for this metric must also be used as a less reliable benchmark.Given the turmoil, I would expect investors to hold their coins on exchanges for much shorter periods of time, using exchanges as transactional vehicles only.Funding rates for BTC, often used as an indicator of sentiment, have turned positive again after two sharp moves down.The final verdict will depend on the individual's time horizon. Contagion effects are still working their way through markets, not to mention the looming overhang of government regulation.Bitcoin and ether’s core principles remain unchanged. As such, recent turmoil may represent a unique opportunity for bullish investors, albeit not without additional challenges.",2022/11/11
429,"The swift collapse of the FTX crypto exchange has sparked an industry push among big rivals to publish proof of their reserves as a means to provide transparency into the assets on their platforms.With those efforts just getting underway, one firm, Crypto.com, has taken the proactive step of providing a preliminary set of disclosures – sharing wallet addresses with the blockchain analysis firm Nansen to create a dashboard of nearly $3 billion of reserves and other assets.What that shows is just how heavily the mix of assets is skewed toward a meme-y token called shiba inu (SHIB), a digital asset built atop the Ethereum blockchain that was largely inspired by the joke token dogecoin (DOGE). Like DOGE – a key staple of billionaire Elon Musk’s crypto schtick on Twitter – the SHIB token is a highly volatile cryptocurrency whose primary use case is often considered to be speculation itself; it’s traded for fast profits and yuks.Of the $2.88 billion in total assets in the wallets, roughly $558 million, or about 20%, are in SHIB.The holding ranks second only to the $872 million of bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, which represents 31%. The amount exceeds the $487 million in ether (ETH), the second-biggest cryptocurrency, and dwarfs the $1.5 million in dogecoin, Nansen data suggests.A Crypto.com spokesperson said, ""The reason our Proof of Reserves include Shiba is because we hold customers' balances 1:1. Thus, our Proof of Reserves are dictated by our customer holdings.""Crypto.com’s large holding of SHIB is a “reflection of user interest/activity,” Nansen data journalist Martin Lee told CoinDesk via a Telegram message.“In an ideal world, we’d want the best assets to be worth the most, but SHIB and DOGE both have extremely high market caps,” he said. So it’s “not super surprising that retail-heavy exchanges will have a higher concentration of such tokens. And regardless, as an exchange, your main source of revenue would likely be trading fees, so whether it’s meme coins or more fundamentally sound assets, your business model is intact.”The shiba inu token vaulted into the headlines in May 2021 when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was sent roughly $1.2 billion of unsolicited SHIB tokens by creators of several dogecoin knock-offs, and then promptly regifted those to the India COVID-19 Relief Fund.Despite its ridiculousness – or maybe because of it – the SHIB token is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies. The @Shibtoken account on Twitter boasts 3.6 million followers, and even after a swift sell-off across crypto markets the token still has a $5.74 billion market capitalization and a 24-hour trading volume of $347.9 million at press time, per CoinDesk data.Read more: Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB), A Beginner’s Guide 2022UPDATE (Nov. 11, 22:22:44 UTC): Includes a comment from a Crypto.com spokespersonUPDATE (Nov. 12, 00:03:13 UTC): Updates headline by replacing ""Assets"" with ""Token Reserves""",2022/11/11
430,"A Solana-based crypto asset tied to the price of bitcoin temporarily collapsed in value Friday after CoinDesk reported that FTX US – the only venue left to exchange it for real bitcoin – had frozen withdrawals.Sollet Bitcoin (soBTC), a so-called “wrapped” asset supposedly backed 1-to-1 with bitcoin, plummeted $10,000 at around 2:00 p.m. ET, according to decentralized finance protocol Raydium. It had already spent much of the day trading below its bitcoin peg on the news that FTX had filed for bankruptcy protection.The wrapped asset later recovered much of its value after FTX US inexplicably reversed course and reopened withdrawals, allowing traders to once again exit their positions. FTX US communicated neither move to the public.Read More: FTX US Temporarily Froze Crypto Withdrawals, Adding to Chaos of Bankruptcy ProceedingsThat soBTC would follow FTX into the proverbial “Goblintown” would surprise few in Solana’s decentralized finance (DeFi) circles, many of whom had long speculated that FTX and Alameda held the bitcoin that backed it.Indeed, so intertwined was the bitcoin derivative and Sam Bankman-Fried’s trading empire that exchange employees were pinged on every withdrawal in the company Slack, a person said.FTX was the only place traders could redeem their Solana-based bitcoin for real bitcoin. Shuttering withdrawals Friday, FTX effectively stranded everyone who still held the 16,000-odd soBTC still in circulation at press time Friday.According to developers at blockchain indexer SolanaFM, 90% of soBTC is on wallets controlled by FTX or Alameda, meaning the coin’s traders had meager holdings of soBTC going into the crash.Part of that could be due to DeFi projects preparing for the worst. Crypto lending protocols Solend and Hubble and decentralized exchange Mango Markets took steps to limit their and their users’ exposure in the final hours Friday.“All sollet wrapped assets like soBTC are backed by FTX so nobody knows the collateralization status of those assets,” said Ben Chow, co-founder of DeFi protocol Jupiter Aggregator.The community’s collective belief in FTX and Alameda was nonetheless enough to turn the early entrant to Solana ecosystem into critical collateral across the chain’s DeFi landscape, people told CoinDesk.

431,"Only a handful of former Ethereum miners are able to survive in the post-Merge world, and some are making it by hopping from token to token. Those that are able to survive are eking out smaller profits than they enjoyed when they were mining ether.In September, the Ethereum blockchain, built for smart contracts and decentralized applications, switched from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which requires mining, to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model, which needs validators.Dubbed “the Merge,” the change decreased Ethereum’s energy usage by 99.998%, thwarting a major criticism on blockchain networks, but it meant that thousands of miners had to figure out what to do with their equipment, a key source of income for many.Over a month later, fewer than 20% of Ethereum miners, or 200 terahash (TH), a measure of computing power, “were able to find a new home in crypto mining, while also suffering from a significant decrease in margins,” said Ethan Vera, chief operations officer at mining services company Luxor.Alternative coins, or altcoins, reward miners for their computational work significantly less than ether or bitcoin. That’s because their price tags are far lower than ether or bitcoin. Some miners have chosen not to mine at all after the Merge because they had already recouped their initial investment on graphics processing units (GPU) a while back.As such, only those with the most efficient machines and lowest power costs can mine altcoins without finding themselves in negative margin territory.Given the current market, altcoins can only accommodate about a fifth of the global hashrate and miners are faced with the fact that their mining revenue does not cover their electricity bills, a spokesperson for mining pool f2pool said.But at the same time, as miners flock to mining any PoW token, a mechanism known as difficulty kicks in, meaning it is less likely for them to earn a reward, thus further lowering their earnings.To take advantage of these quickly shifting winds where reward values change with token prices and the likelihood of earning rewards changes with the difficulty, publicly listed miner Hive Blockchain (HIVE) is using a switching algorithm that automatically redirects its GPUs to the most profitable coin, said Aydin Kilic, the firm’s president and chief operating officer. Hive then exchanges these coins into bitcoin.Thus, its strategy overall is to repurpose and optimize its GPUs to expand its BTC production, the president said. That way, Hive earns more dollars per kilowatt-hour than by just mining ethereum classic (ETC) or ravencoin (RVN), Kilic said.Similarly, miners flocked to the Nicehash platform because of its software that enables this type of automated switching in the 24 hours after the Merge, said Joe Downie, chief marketing officer at the hash power brokerage platform.Downie said the platform went from about one million to 600,000 customers across Nicehash products after the Merge.After the Merge, altcoins faced feedback loops of miners flooding a token, increasing its difficulty and then leaving the network.The majority of miners mined right up to the last minute possible. While some were unsure what to do when the Merge took effect, many had already made plans, said Downie.Larger miners prepared in advance, some even repurposing their GPUs for artificial intelligence and cloud computing, but many solo miners had to play it by ear.After the network switched to PoS, miners behaved “frantically,” with “the vast majority hopping from coin to coin in attempts to remain as profitable as possible,” said a representative for mining software provider Hiveon. But this led to a “vicious cycle” in which miners saturated a market until they were forced to abandon it.The Ethereum Classic blockchain’s hashrate jumped about fourfold from Sept. 12-16, around the time of the Merge, to around 200 terahash/second (TH/s), and its difficulty concurrently went up by about the same factor, data from CoinWarz shows. Ethereum Classic’s hashrate has since fallen to about 125-135 TH/s, as miners got priced out of mining the Ethereum fork.Ethereum Classic is the easiest switch because its algorithm is the closest to mining Ethereum, Downie said. The blockchain was formed by a fork on Ethereum in 2016.Similar trends were evident for mining ravencoin (RVN), beam (BEAM) and ergo (ERG).Miners that use GPUs are mainly going for ravencoin, Downie said, as ETC is increasingly dominated by application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), specialized computers like those used for bitcoin mining.Much like the rest of the industry, Ethereum miners of the past are waiting for a bull market, keeping their machines humming in hopes other coins will pump in the future.“Some miners still chose to continue mining even though their revenues could not cover electricity bills,” f2pool said.",2022/11/11
432,"Journalists don’t like to be the story. We prefer to tell it.But with CoinDesk playing a central role in this week’s FTX meltdown – following Ian Allison’s bombshell on Alameda Research’s suspect balance sheet last week – I got to thinking that we media folk may have to be the story this time around. So, let’s examine journalism’s place in the crypto industry. TLDR: It’s complicated, to say the least.You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.On the one hand, there’s an unreasonable hostility toward journalists in some quarters of the crypto community. It’s exacerbated by a blinkered, self-interested perspective fostered by price-dependent online communities and by a tech utopianism popular in Silicon Valley. This anti-press mindset breeds conspiracy theories and, in steering everyone into the confines of the subcommunities gathered around their pet investment projects, fuels a toxic fragmentation in which each clings to their own narrow version of the truth. It’s “my token, right or wrong.”This was evident in the unfounded charges laid against CoinDesk on Twitter by people alarmed by the fallout from the FTX revelations: the Alameda story was “fake news”; CoinDesk ran a story planted by Binance to play its “games”; it was a clear case of FUD (stories sowing fear, uncertainty and doubt) to undermine confidence in the market.(Needless to say, those charges are all patently untrue. I shouldn’t need proof, but the haste with which Binance abandoned its buyout of FTX laid bare how bad FTX and Alameda's finances truly were at the time of Ian Allison’s report.)Watch: Crypto Exchange FTX Files for Bankruptcy Protection in US; CEO Bankman-Fried ResignsOn the other hand, the multiyear story of FTX’s rise and fall, now culminating in stunning evidence of gross misuse of users’ funds, reminds us that journalists can fall victim to the blindness of hero worship. Tough questions should have been asked earlier of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Alameda Research’s phantom balance sheet, propped up with a self-issued currency from sister company FTX, was there in plain sight and we in the press failed to see it until now. Too many accepted the fairytale story of the altruistic “SBF” wunderkind.It’s noteworthy that this story broke just after a tweet from privacy activist Edward Snowden highlighted a history of Central Intelligence Agency representatives abusing the trust of journalists – and their inability to verify those agents’ privileged-access claims – to sow disinformation. It’s also in the vein of how local television news takes police reports of violence at face value, the social injustice of which was highlighted in a recent episode of John Oliver’s ”This Week Tonight” show on HBO.Both sides need introspection, in other words: critics of the press and the press itself.Let me start with the lesson for press critics. These include the token investors who barge their way into CoinDesk reporters’ Twitter mentions to accuse them of bias or corruption or stupidity just because they didn’t cover some protocol development of non-fungible token drop that to their biased perspective is the “biggest untold story in crypto.”My message to them: Try, maybe, to step outside the narrow confines of your financial interests and look at the bigger picture. It is not the crypto press’s role to protect or promote the participants in an NFT project, the short-term financial interests of FTT investors or bitcoin HODLers. It is to bring transparency to the companies and other institutions that hold influence over how this industry and its markets function, regardless of price impact. That responsibility extends both to what we choose to cover and what we choose not to cover.Transparency exposes malfeasance and entails reporting on otherwise hidden corporate accounts that reveal fragile finances. In the biggest cases, such as that of this past week, doing so will mean that a house of cards will inevitably fall, and, along with it, token prices. But sooner or later these issues would be revealed anyway.Read more: FTX Showed the Problems of Centralized Finance, and Proved the Need for DeFiIt’s better if these revelations can be revealed sooner, because then we can learn the lessons and react accordingly. Can more effective regulation be introduced to protect consumers? What can investors learn about token valuation? Is it time to “do your own research?”If the crypto industry is to mature, and if its underlying technology is to live up its vast potential, we must flesh out these unstable structures and bad practices. Sorry. There is no free lunch.This is the purpose that we at CoinDesk have set for ourselves. Like any media company, we strive to be profitable, but the route to that is defined by a broader mission: to lead the narrative on the development of this industry by bringing transparency to the global movement that’s driving it. We see this honest, warts-and-all exposure as our contribution to the better world that this technology has the potential to support.Now for our own introspection.“Trust, but verify” was a term – lifted, ironically, from a Russian proverb – made popular by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan during his negotiations with the Soviet Union over nuclear disarmament. In the late 1990s, cryptographer Adam Back and entrepreneur Austin Hill, who later co-founded Blockstream, paraphrased the line to rewrite it as “Don’t Trust. Verify.” The negative wording was stronger for a reason, based on the notion that reliance on a third party with the capacity to censor, change or control information is dangerous.The imperative to verify was a nod to cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs, with which people can prove the veracity of information without having to trust assurances from those with an interest in lying to you.The thinking behind the first, Reagan-era coinage is something all journalists should embrace as a matter of course. It’s the “show me the money” idea. You don’t necessarily assume your source is untrustworthy but, without some other independent means of verification, you simply can’t run with the information they provide.The problem is that it is often difficult, if not impossible, to obtain independent verification because all means of communication around the relevant topic are controlled by the party you’re covering. It’s the problem of “asymmetric information” that underpins U.S. securities laws: those with the data have the power to control how it is used. And that’s where the dependence on powerful people kicks in, which then gets distorted by the hero worship identified above.This is where cryptography comes into play. Already, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, is declaring that his exchange is embracing a “proof of reserves” model based on the cryptographic instrument of Merkle trees and calling on others to follow suit. This would presumably offer anyone, including an investigating journalist, a tamper-proof source of information on a company’s assets.Read more: Crypto Exchanges Scramble to Compile 'Proof of Reserves' as FTX Contagion Grips MarketsThere are also efforts afoot to bring blockchain verification of evidence trails into journalism, notably by the Starling Project at Stanford University, while other projects – including Refound, a winner of the Web3athon launched at CoinDesk’s Consensus this year – apply encryption solutions to protect journalists’ information gathering from snoopers.If such tools become the norm, a “Don’t Trust. Verify” standard could arise in journalism. Claims from powerful people need no longer be taken at face value.But although there are some cryptographic tools that journalists can independently apply to their truth-seeking efforts, it really can’t be up to them to fix this. We need an overhaul of the system for recording and proving information, and that requires change by the investigated, not by the investigators. In reality, it needs regulation, or at the very least industry-driven self-regulation, to change practices.So let’s hope that, for transparency and the healthy growth of this industry, regulators will look to zero-knowledge proofs, Merkle trees and encryption to impose crypto-savvy data requirements on entities operating in this space.In the meantime, please support the journalists who are working against an asymmetric information system to try to bring transparency to this industry.",2022/11/11

434,"Much furor has been generated on Twitter about Elon Musk’s new ""blue tick"" (checkmark) verification scheme. Existing blue ticks (full disclosure: I am one) are up in arms about the plan, which would give anyone a blue checkmark on their tweets if they pay Musk $8 a month, with no questions asked. Twitter Blue marketing makes it clear that there will be no identity verification. Pseudonymous accounts will be able to get blue ticks.Musk has expressed a hope that opening the blue tick scheme to a much wider audience will eliminate hate speech on Twitter and stop the proliferation of bots, spammers and fraudsters. But I’m afraid he is entirely mistaken. The payment of $8 per month is nowhere near enough to compensate for elimination of centralized identity checks. And the reason should be entirely obvious to anyone who is familiar with crypto, and in particular the problem that Bitcoin originally solved – the “Byzantine Generals” problem.Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.The Byzantine Generals problem is all about the difficulty of reliably establishing identity in a distributed system that has no trusted central authority. The original 1982 research paper by Leslie Lamport, Robert Shostok and Marshall Pease imagined several armies besieging Byzantium, each army led by a General – hence the name “Byzantine Generals problem.” Some of the Generals and their subordinates are traitors who are trying to confuse the rest. Without knowing who the traitors are, and with only oral messages as a means of communication – or perhaps Twitter – the loyal Generals must coordinate their attacks. The research paper shows that in the absence of a trusted central authority, the loyal Generals will be unable to coordinate their attacks if the proportion of traitors among the Generals and their subordinates is too high.Twitter’s blue ticks are a fine example of the Byzantine Generals problem. The blue tick is meant to prove that the Twitter account actually is run by the person it claims to represent. So, for example, an account called “Joe Biden” has a blue tick to prove that it is run by the real U.S. President Joe Biden (or his staff), not an imposter. But blue ticks are allocated through an opaque process run by a centralized team at Twitter, which is not accountable to the Twitter community and is suspected of corruption. Rumors circulate that blue ticks can be bought for $15,000 or $36,000 or some such figure. There’s no evidence this is true, but it doesn’t matter. People believe the rumors, and that is sufficient to destroy trust. The blue tick that was supposed to reliably identify celebrities, influencers, companies and brands is no longer reliable.Enter Elon Musk, savior of the blue tick. He proposes to eliminate the existing centralized verification process completely, and instead give blue ticks to anyone willing to pay $8 per month, including pseudonymous accounts. This is a decentralized solution because people will decide for themselves whether to pay the subscription rather than the allocation of blue ticks being determined by a central trusted authority. As with existing blue ticks, the new blue tick will confer advantages in platform visibility – the Twitter algorithm boosts tweets issued by blue ticks above those of ordinary users. The subscription payment is presumably supposed to be low enough to encourage genuine Twitter users to sign up for blue ticks, but high enough to discourage bots, spammers and fraudsters. But – is it?Read more: Dan Kuhn - The Web3 Twitter Fixes Elon Musk Could Actually TryThe authors of the ""Byzantine Generals"" paper say that any solution to the problem is necessarily expensive. Satoshi Nakamoto’s solution (proof-of-work) is indeed expensive, and so is proof-of-stake, recently adopted by Ethereum. But as Elon Musk himself pointed out, $8 per month is the price of a Starbucks latte. Some people can’t afford this, of course. But I’d suggest that most Twitter users – and certainly those that have, or want, blue ticks, can, easily. It’s small change. And for some of Twitter’s most toxic elements, it will be well worth it to create the impression of authenticity and amplify their tweets.Of course, there’s still centralized moderation of tweets. Liberalization of blue ticks isn’t carte blanche to post hate speech on the platform. But I am looking forward to the lawsuits when Twitter starts suspending accounts that are paying $8 a month.More importantly, $8 per month doesn’t appear to create much disincentive for bots, spammers and fraudsters, or even the sock puppet accounts that infest the platform. For them, tweet amplification is gold. I predict that bot and sock puppet farms will bulk-buy blue ticks, and crypto spam accounts shilling tokens will all have blue ticks and there will be an epidemic of blue tick phishers.However, Musk’s aim to enable ordinary Twitter users to obtain blue ticks is laudable. And there’s no doubt that the existing centralized process is unfit for the purpose. So how could Twitter create an identity verification process that didn’t rely on a centralized authority, was open to anyone who could prove their identity and discouraged fascists, bots, spammers, fraudsters and sock puppets?Well, Musk could do worse than look at the solutions adopted by the cryptocurrencies of which he is so fond. Both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake use a community-led process with volunteer verifiers. The verifiers are incentivized by the potential for rewards, and kept honest by harsh financial penalties for abusing the system. Verification is expensive for the verifiers, but not for the users whose transactions are being verified – they just pay transaction (gas) fees. Could such a system work for Twitter verification?There’s an obvious problem, and that is that verifiers have no more idea than anyone else whether an account that has applied for verification is malicious. But Twitter users are pretty good at identifying malicious accounts. There’s no reason to suppose that Twitter verifiers who have staked a whole load of money (much more than $8 per month) for the right to verify identity would be any worse – indeed they would have an obvious incentive to get it right, if the penalty for inadvertently verifying (say) a neo-Nazi account was to lose part or all of their stake. And all that is needed is for enough of them to agree. Some kind of majority voting system would work. It’s complex, but surely not beyond the ability of the bright minds in the tech world to solve.What rewards might Elon Musk offer Twitter verifiers? Well, he could offer money: treat them like shareholders, pay them a dividend. Or he could offer them voting rights, for example over the introduction of new facilities. But would he agree to such dilution of his power?It seems to me this is the fundamental problem. Twitter, the decentralized “town square,” was unfortunately so centralized that it could be taken over by a dictator. Dictators are not usually too keen on decentralization.I hope that Elon Musk’s longstanding interest in crypto will encourage him to look at decentralized solutions to the problems that he is rightly identifying. But that might mean stepping back from Twitter and setting the community free to fly on its own.",2022/11/11

The crypto market lost its $1 trillion market capitalization, dropping 18.3% to $803 billion.Bitcoin (BTC) dropped about 7% to a 24-hour low of $16,351 during early U.S. trading hours. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) of 162 digital assets slid 3.3%, leaving it down 16% in November.The decline partially reversed a big rally on Thursday, when a report showing slower-than-expected inflation in October gave bitcoin traders some relief. The largest cryptocurrency shot up about 10%, the biggest daily gain in two months.As the bitcoin price has tumbled, many speculators have homed in on Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, and the losses likely to be adding up on the company’s bitcoin holdings, eating away at the company’s equity – and whether a capitulation might be in the offing.In an interview with CNBC, Saylor said that bitcoin is still 33% higher than when he first bough it in 2020 and that he will continue to purchase and hold the asset. ""Our shareholders are winning, and we're going to stick with that strategy because it's working for us,” he said on Thursday.Previously, Saylor acknowledged that the company would struggle to have enough bitcoin as collateral if the price dropped below $3,562, but that they could post other assets if that happened.The FTX exchange's in-house token (FTT) – where the crisis of confidence first began to appear early this week in digital-asset markets – dropped another 33%. Huobi token (HT), which briefly gained 400% on Thursday amid news that Tron-based tokens would be redeemed 1:1 from FTX, fell 15% on Friday; Tron leader Justin Sun is a global advisor to Huobi and owns HT tokens. Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped over 11%.The Solana blockchain’s SOL token fell 14.3% to $16.25. The SOL tokens were a major holding of Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research trading firm.

440,"Our community keeps learning the lesson of decentralization the hard way. Celsius Network. BlockFi. Voyager Digital. Now FTX.These are all centralized exchanges (CEXs) and centralized financed platforms (CeFi). Their business models are centuries old; the only new thing about them is they offer users exposure to crypto assets – but crucially, not root ownership, since they hold the keys to those assets.Amanda Cassatt is the founder and CEO of Serotonin, a Web3 marketing agency and product studio.Like the financial institutions that collapsed in 2008, their economic incentive is to under-collateralize and take risks with user funds. They play political games, cozying up to regulators who claim to care about consumer protection.The pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto was inspired by the events of 2008 when creating Bitcoin that year. When the network launched, they inscribed these words in its genesis block, “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”See also: The Collapse of the FTX Empire This headline from The Times of London sent a powerful message about Satoshi’s intentions: Large financial institutions had spent years privatizing the gains from taking risks that led to collapse, and once it came they forced the public to bear their losses thanks to their influence on politicians with discretionary decision-making power.With Bitcoin, Satoshi changed the locus of decision making from politicians to an automated code base, giving regular people the option to permissionless-ly participate in an alternative financial system, one where the rules are public, apply to everyone and execute automatically. Then, with smart contracts, Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) delivered these benefits in various forms to hundreds of thousands of people.In an echo of the 2008 financial collapse, the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research has triggered a “run on the banks” across crypto markets. Some CEXs and CeFi platforms are overwhelmed with users withdrawing funds forcing them to freeze transfers off the platform. Some must be insolvent.Those with funds on FTX will likely lose their money. A number of large venture firms as well as Web3 companies told their investors Wednesday that a significant portion of their AUM [assets under management] or treasuries were lost to CEXs. It’s a hard way to learn the basic hygiene of keeping minimal funds on CEXs only for immediate trading.Despite sell-offs, Uniswap, Balancer, Curv, and other decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms have been functioning smoothly, enabling users to exit their crypto positions or, if they prefer, to capitalize on low prices and buy in. Users may have seen their portfolios decrease in dollar value, but they never lost access to their assets. If that isn’t consumer protection, I don’t know what is.When I was at ConsenSys and we were first introducing Ethereum to the world, we had a sign at our events that said, “Welcome to the decentralized future.” Our community was then, and is still, asked to explain the use of this new technology. The best answer was, and still is, decentralization.DeFi platforms are designed to preserve the benefits introduced by Bitcoin and magnified by Ethereum: permissionlessness, transparency, censorship resistance and self-sovereign custody of assets.Users should insist on a base settlement layer for economic activity that is as decentralized as possible, to avoid exactly the scenario that has played out in recent days. History may not repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme – and we would do well to heed the lessons it teaches.Like the large financial institutions involved in the 2008 meltdown, which donated generously to political campaigns, the FTX crypto exchange spent its final weeks spending lavishly to court regulators. Its founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried even had the audacity to say DeFi needed consumer protections while, as has become clear, playing fast and loose with user funds.Consider for a moment that SBF was running the second-largest CEX, and centralized platforms see DeFi as a competitor. What he wanted from regulation wasn’t consumer protection, but rather to protect his incumbent position and entrench his competitive moat.Regulators are paying attention to this collapse, as is their job. Those with good intentions should see through the Times Square billboards about ESG [environment and social governance] and the fancy soirees and understand that centralized players calling for DeFi regulation do so because it serves their interests. Regulators should also recognize that as far as consumer protections goes DeFi has beat CeFi time and time again.See also: The Role Regulators Played in the FTX Fiasco | OpinionRegulation that doesn’t overprotect incumbents or harm actually decentralized projects could be a boon for the industry, offering the clarity institutional investors waiting on the sidelines need to start deploying capital. It could clear our space of many of its scams by making it riskier to perpetrate them.If there is a silver lining for the FTX fiasco, it is a reminder of the importance of decentralization. While it has taken a sledge hammer to all crypto prices, layer 1 blockchains that de-prioritized decentralization as a design goal have been the hardest hit.The FTX collapse was a failure of CeFi, not DeFi – and smart investors, builders and users are already taking notice. I believe that many have learned their lesson this time. To them: Welcome, once again, to the decentralized future.",2022/11/11

443,"Ether (ETH) has turned deflationary for the first time since the token's parent blockchain Ethereum changed how it processes transactions nearly two months ago.Data from ultrasound.money shows the second-largest cryptocurrency's net issuance, or the annualized inflation rate, has dropped to 0.029%, indicating that the leading smart contract blockchain is now burning more ether than what's being minted.The negative inflation rate means ether's net supply has declined by 5,598 since Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism of verifying transactions from a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism on Sept. 15. Ether's supply would have increased by nearly 670,000 had Ethereum continued to use the PoW mechanism.The upgrade, dubbed Merge, put ether on the path to becoming a deflationary asset by replacing miners with validators as entities responsible for running the blockchain and causing a drastic reduction in the newly minted ETH. Ether's annualized inflation rate crashed from over 3.5% to nearly zero following the Merge.The deflationary milestone, however, remained elusive for nearly two months before finally being reached, with the recent increase in the Ethereum network activity prompting an uptick in the amount of ether burned. That's a sign that ether's prospects as a deflationary asset heavily depend on the degree of network usage.On Wednesday, more than 5,000 ETH was burned, the highest single-day tally since June, according to Etherscan. More than 13,000 ETH have been burned in the past three days alone. The Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559, implemented in August of last year, introduced a mechanism to burn a portion of fees paid by users. The EIP is essentially tied the amount of ether burned with the network usage.The latest increase in network usage could be attributed to market volatility triggered by the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Millions of dollars worth of crypto funds have been moved on-chain ever since FTX's liquidity woes became public. On Thursday, FTX's select customers were allowed to withdraw funds through Ethereum.The positive change in ether's tokenomics could help the cryptocurrency outperform bitcoin and the wider market once the FTX-induced panic subsides.At press time, ether changed hands at $1,270, representing a 1.7% decline on the day, according to CoinDesk data.",2022/11/11

The other representatives on the filing are part of a corporate services firm that helped establish the entity.This Singapore entity is wholly owned by Alameda’s British Virgin Islands parent. There’s also an Alameda Research entity in The Bahamas, as many of the staff are based on the island.There’s no Alameda Research in Hong Kong, but rather a Cottonwood Grove that is controlled by Bankman-Fried (it shares the name with an entity in Antigua).If FTX ends up filing for a U.S. bankruptcy, there will be a document dump, much like in the case of Three Arrows Capital, where all will be laid bare.Meanwhile, the Financial Times has a first look at what it believes is the FTX empire and the results of their research is impressive.Surely regulators like the Commodities Futures Trading Commission were aware of the Alameda-FTX relationship for some time, but this spectacular collapse of the two companies will force them to act.During the GameStop frenzy of early 2021, market maker Citadel Securities came under intense scrutiny for its relationship with brokers. Now imagine if Citadel and the New York Stock Exchange were one and the same. Regulators’ heads explode if Jeffrey Sprecher and Ken Griffin’s names appeared together on a list of a company’s directors.And what do other crypto market makers think of all of this? They don’t like it.One that spoke to CoinDesk on background clarified that market makers and takers (the counterparty) must have equal access to the exchange with no party at an advantage. Exchanges are also not supposed to comingle funds, something Reuters reported FTX is guilty of doing.We’ll learn a lot more if FTX ends up before a bankruptcy court.

446,"Amid the bitter cold crypto winter, will FTX’s crumbling affect crypto prices in the short term or indefinitely prolong the harsh weather? And how does the movement in crypto prices this week compare with other challenges this market has faced in its brief history?The first question is difficult to answer. Industry-shaking events earlier this year exacerbated a price plunge already in the making, although bitcoin (BTC) established a safe zone during the summer, with support in the $19,000-$20,000 range.As the impact of the FTX crypto exchange’s insolvency has sunk in, contagion fears have sent bitcoin’s price plunging to a two-year low, and ether’s dropping to midsummer levels. But crypto has survived other storms, rebounding to new highs within months or years. And price movement remains stubbornly difficult to predict.Crypto asset management giant Galaxy Digital announced a $77 million exposure to FTX, with $48 million potentially locked in withdrawals. Prominent crypto firms Genesis (like CoinDesk, owned by Digital Currency Group), Wintermute, and Multicoin are also said to have exposure to FTX.And now regulators, already alarmed by this year’s failures of crypto heavyweights Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, are weighing in.For instance, the U.S. Department of Justice, Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have begun probing what caused FTX's insolvency, and whether outright fraud was involved.In Congress on Thursday, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who heads the House Financial Services Committee, called for stronger crypto regulation. She said that “now more than ever, it is clear that there are major consequences when cryptocurrency entities operate without robust federal oversight, and protections for customers.”The term “robust” will likely startle investors, including those within decentralized finance (DeFi), despite the sub-sector’s relative lack of participation in any of the recent turmoil.Will traditional finance (TradFi) companies, which have shown an increasing interest in crypto, be swept up in the current mess?Contagion spillover to TradFi, whether real or perceived, will likely further increase scrutiny from regulators.Meanwhile, crypto prices have been volatile, although markets have seen worse in their brief history.BTC’s Nov. 9 decline was its 10th-largest decrease since 2015, although it's only the second-largest decline for 2022, highlighting how tumultuous the year has been.Trading volume was the seventh highest over the last seven years on Nov. 9, and fourth highest on Nov. 8.For ETH, the 17% decline on Nov. 9 was its seventh largest since 2017.Trading volume on Nov. 8 and Nov. 9 don’t crack the top 50 highest days over the last five years.At first glance, this is surprising. Percentage declines during one of the most pivotal moments in cryptocurrency history barely cracking the top 10 was unexpected.A possible explanation is that investors holding BTC and ETH are continuing to ""hodl"" their assets. The percentage of profitable bitcoin and ether addresses has dropped to 50% and 47%, respectively, according to data from Glassnode.Or the trend could simply highlight the resiliency of certain assets overall. Both BTC and ETH rose sharply on Thursday, following a CPI report that showed inflation in the U.S. is slowing by more than expected.",2022/11/10
447,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) Executive Chairman Michael Saylor told CNBC he’s not straying from his strategy of buying and holding bitcoin (BTC) despite the crypto’s plunge to a new two-year low this week.Bitcoin's price tumbled below $16,000 Thursday in the wake of beleaguered crypto exchange FTX's collapse. Following a modest bounce on the release of U.S. consumer price index data Thursday morning, BTC is now hovering slightly above $17,000.While acknowledging it’s been a “roller coaster,” the famed bitcoin bull said that bitcoin is 33% higher than when he first began buying in 2020, and that MicroStrategy’s stock is up 38% during that period – outperforming the major averages and such popular tech mega-cap names as Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN).“Our shareholders are winning, and we're going to stick with that strategy because it's working for us,” he said.Of course, MicroStrategy made many sizable subsequent purchases of bitcoin – some backed with large amounts of debt – after that first buy. It now holds more than 129,000 coins purchased at an average price of over $30,000. With bitcoin at around $17,000, questions are again arising as to whether MicroStrategy might have to be a forced seller despite Saylor’s continued bullishness.It’s a question that was asked earlier this year on the company's first-quarter earnings call (with bitcoin at about $30,000), and then-outgoing Chief Financial Officer Phong Le suggested a price at or below $21,000 could serve as a trigger point for a margin call. Saylor, however, was quick to clarify those remarks, taking to Twitter to clearly delineate MicroStrategy's obligations in regard to its bitcoin-backed loans.""MicroStrategy has a $205 million term loan and needs to maintain $410 million as collateral,"" he wrote. He further noted the company had more than 115,000 unencumbered bitcoin (then worth about $3 billion and today worth roughly $2 billion) with which it could pledge as needed. He did acknowledge that should the price fall below $3,562, the company would run out of bitcoin to use as collateral, but even then could post other assets.""We're excited about bitcoin [because] it's something greater than all of us,"" said Saylor today. ""We're actually buying into a protocol which is spreading all across the earth to solve a problem.""Read More: Michael Saylor Suggests MicroStrategy Will Never Sell Its BitcoinCORRECTION (Nov. 10 20:50 UTC): The U.S. consumer price index data was released Thursday morning.",2022/11/10
448,"Withdrawals from the FTX crypto exchange were so rapid and vicious that the overall balance of digital assets on the venue has tumbled 87% over the past five days, data shows.The blockchain-era version of an epic bank run culminated Nov. 8 when the exchange led by Sam Bankman-Fried announced a halt to withdrawals. (On Thursday there were fresh reports that some withdrawal requests were suddenly getting processed, although some Twitter posters wrote that they have since been shut off.)The data, from Arkham Intelligence, might be a conservative estimate of FTX’s balance history because there may be wallet addresses that haven’t been disclosed to the public.FTX’s average total balances between Oct. 1 and Nov. 4 was $7.9 billion, and stood at $8.4 billion as of Nov. 5, Arkham data shows. The balances then dropped considerably to $1.1 billion as of Nov. 10.The rush for the exits coincided with a steep plunge in the price of the FTX’s in-house exchange token, FTT.From Oct. 1 through Nov. 4, the FTT price ranged from a lower bound of $22 and an upper bound of $26. Then, all of a sudden, the floor fell out: FTT had sunk to about $2 as of press time.Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) tweeted Thursday that FTX “saw roughly $5 [billion] of withdrawals on Sunday.”The immense scope of this black swan-style event serves as a key reminder of just how rapidly confidence can erode in the parallel financial universe of digital assets – where there are no central banks to bail out the key players – as happened in 2008 when nearly all of Wall Street ran short of liquidity and had to turn to the Federal Reserve for emergency funding.Drilling down, the balance of ether (ETH) on FTX has fallen some 88%, according to the blockchain analytics firm Nansen.As of Nov. 10 at press time, FTX holds 50,544.94 ETH ($66.5 million) at time of press, down from 429,210.46 ETH ($564.8 million) on Nov. 4, the data shows.From Oct. 21 to Nov. 4, users deposited 290,820 ETH and withdrew 15,803 ETH. With 18.4x more ETH deposits than withdrawals in that time period, user confidence in FTX was solid, but this rapidly changed.It is no surprise FTX’s bitcoin (BTC) balance also took a sharp fall.Even as bitcoin’s price held steady around $20,000 earlier in the week, FTX’s BTC holdings started nosediving on Nov. 7, according to data from Coinglass. FTX held 21,850 bitcoins across all exchanges on Nov. 6, and by the next day, FTX’s balance dropped to virtually nil.Around the same time, bitcoin’s price started falling, as crypto analysts fretted that larger cryptocurrencies might get caught up in a broader wave of selling across digital-asset markets.On Nov. 6, BTC was changing hands around the $21,000 level. It tumbled close to $15,000, but had recovered to about $17,400 as of press time.",2022/11/10
449,"The crypto deleveraging sparked by the apparent collapse of crypto exchange FTX and its sister company Alameda Research will be “more problematic” than earlier ones because there’s a lack of strong entities and balance sheets that could come to rescue, JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a note to clients Wednesday.“Given the size and interlinkages of both FTX and Alameda Research with other entities of the crypto ecosystem including DeFi platforms it looks likely that a new cascade of margin calls, deleveraging and crypto company/platform failures is starting similar to what we saw last May/June following the collapse of Terra,” JPMorgan’s strategists said in their note to clients. DeFi, or decentralized finance, is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on blockchains.JPMorgan said investors can potentially look for a bottom in bitcoin (BTC) pricing through its production cost, which has sometimes acted as a floor. The current production cost is about $15,000, though it's likely to revisit the $13,000 it hit in recent months, implying a decline of around 25% from here, the bank noted.On the optimistic front, JPMorgan said the hit to crypto’s overall market cap may be less than after Terra as deleveraging has been occurring.Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Says Alameda Winding Down, Promises FTX US Customers 'Fine'",2022/11/10

Sam Bankman-Fried’s firm is once again staring down the barrel after rival exchange Binance said it was walking away from the deal to acquire FTX after it scrutinized FTX’s books. Without volunteering any details, Sun tweeted that he is “putting together a solution with FTX."" Tron’s native token TRX momentarily surged 4,000% from 6 cents to $2.50 following the news. The network’s algorithmic stablecoin USDD, however, has lost its dollar peg, recently trading at 98 cents, with Sun speculating Alameda Research, the liquidity-strapped sister company of FTX, might have sold its USDD holdings, kickstarting the stablecoin's deviation.The U.S. Consumer Price Index showed that consumer prices rose 7.7% in October from a year earlier, below both the 8.2% growth in September and the 8% increase analysts had estimated. The price of bitcoin (BTC), which has been hammered in the past few days by fears of contagion from the calamity surrounding FTX and Alameda Research, jumped 6% in the minutes after the report. The speculation is that a slower pace of inflation will allow the Federal Reserve to ease off in its campaign to tighten monetary policy – theoretically a positive for risky assets like cryptocurrencies. Ether (ETH), meanwhile, was trading at $1,291, up from earlier lows.FTX used customer funds to prop up sister firm Alameda Research in May, according to a Reuters report, citing people familiar with the matter. CEO Sam Bankman-Fried transferred at least $4 billion from FTX to support his trading firm Alameda after it suffered a series of losses. Part of this $4 billion was customer deposits though the exact proportion couldn’t be determined. Among Alameda’s losses was a $500 million loan agreed with crypto lender Voyager Digital, which filed for bankruptcy later.",2022/11/10
451,"For nearly a decade, crypto investors and advocates have promoted bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a store of value against fiat currency. Due to the tokenomics behind bitcoin, many savvy investors believe that bitcoin is a hedge against the loss of purchasing power experienced in many fiat currencies.Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million bitcoins. The issuance rate of bitcoin is known by all market participants and the bitcoin blockchain will eventually reach a state of 0% inflation once all the bitcoins have been mined. Many investors and bitcoin advocates believe that this economic design makes the cryptocurrency far superior to other permanently inflationary cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.The value of fiat currencies is determined by governments and central banks. For over a decade, the US Federal Reserve has had an inflation target of 2% for the U.S. dollar. Another way to think about inflation is in the purchasing power of the dollar decreasing. As a currency inflates, the purchasing power of that currency declines over time.On one hand, many economists believe that by creating an inflationary currency they can spur economic growth and encourage spending in the market – which they believe strengthens the economy and business cycles.On the other, many other schools of economics do not believe that a loss of purchasing power in an economy's main currency is beneficial to the long-term health of an economy. This disagreement and contrarian belief has led many to adopt and hold bitcoin – among other cryptocurrencies – as an alternative to fiat currency.Read more: Why Bitcoin Has Been Highly Correlated With FiatBitcoin has certainly outperformed fiat currencies over the last decade. But while many fiat currencies were stable over the last decade, bitcoin’s price was not.Bitcoin has become incredibly popular around the world, has been adopted and used in large parts of the global economy and has seen a very impressive growth rate. Bitcoin was trading under $100/coin in 2012 and reached an all-time high of nearly $70,000 in 2021, under a decade later.The performance of bitcoin over the last decade served as further evidence of the asset being a hedge against fiat currency devaluation and strengthened its store of value investment theory.In 2022, however, it has been a different story. Beginning in 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates and pull liquidity out of the market. Spurred by record high inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve took these extreme measures in order to combat inflation in the economy.By raising interest rates and decreasing market liquidity, the Fed caused assets like stocks, bonds, real estate and even cryptocurrencies to see tremendous headwinds. U.S. stocks are down over 20% year to date, bonds are down over 30%, real estate is down over 15% and cryptocurrencies are down over 60% so far this year (as of November 2022).Many traders describe the market we’re seeing in 2022 as a “risk-off” environment.US Treasury bonds are considered the safest investment in the world. Often described as the “risk-free rate,” these bonds provide investors with a guaranteed yield and protection of principal.Because the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates significantly this year, the risk-free rates of U.S. Treasury bonds are higher than they have been in over a decade. Many investors see this as an opportunity to invest in government bonds – and consequently, they have been purchasing and investing in government bonds over other assets like stocks and crypto.In fact, individuals were so eager to invest in these bonds and the web traffic of people visiting the Treasury Direct website was so high, the website couldn’t handle the traffic and crashed.As the market shifted from a “risk-on” environment, where bond yields were low enough that individuals preferred a more speculative asset allocation, to a “risk-off” environment, cryptocurrencies have underperformed many other assets.This underperformance has led many crypto critics to state that the inflation hedge and store of value theses behind bitcoin have been invalidated. These individuals believe that cryptocurrencies are “risk-on” assets.In other words, when the risk-free rate in the economy is low – and U.S. government bond yields are trivial, as they were for most of the last decade – investors will flock to assets like stocks and cryptocurrency where the potential return is much higher than it is in bonds.When the market is “risk-off,” market participants believe investors will flock to bonds over speculative assets like crypto.Watch: Bitcoin Is Not a Pure CPI Hedge: StrategistWhile cryptocurrency is still very young compared with other asset classes, these markets are helping individuals understand the driving investment thesis behind cryptocurrencies. It is important to understand all the nuances that go into global markets and investment allocations and know how to pivot when the market changes.There has never been a time in bitcoin’s existence where the risk-free rate has been this high, and the eventual outcome will be very helpful for investment managers in the future. Whether or not Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are long-term inflation hedges and a store of value or simply a “risk-on” speculative assets preferred in times when bond yields are unattractive is yet to be perfectly understood.This year has been significantly different than most of the last decade and the market we are currently seeing will be very beneficial to advisors who wish to better understand this new emerging asset class.",2022/11/10
452,"The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4% in October, far slower than expectations for 0.6%, the U.S. Labor Department reported on Thursday. The annual pace slowed to just 7.7% versus estimates for 8%, and down from 8.2% in September.Bitcoin (BTC) – which plunged to a new two-year low of $15,554 on Wednesday thanks to the FTX blowup – gained a quick $1,500, or about 10%, in the minutes after the report. At press time it is trading at $17,750.Core CPI – which strips out food and energy – rose 0.3% in October, slower than expectations for 0.5% and falling from September’s 0.6%. On an annualized basis, core CPI was up 6.3% in October slower than expectations for a 6.5% rise and falling from 6.6% in September.October’s CPI is one of the major reports the Federal Reserve will see before the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) next and final meeting of the year Dec. 14-15. The FOMC is seen raising its benchmark fed funds rate for a seventh time in 2022 at that meeting.Prior to this morning’s CPI print, futures traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) saw an equal chance for the FOMC to go with either a 50 or 75 basis point hike. After the report, chances for 50 basis points increased to 74%.Behind growing expectations for the smaller move are ideas that recession risks are on the rise, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell conceding at his most recent press conference that the path to a soft landing has “narrowed.” Powell also signaled the central bank might consider a smaller rate increase in December. On the other hand, Powell said the terminal rate for this tightening cycle will likely be higher than previously forecast.“We’ve always said it was going to be difficult, but to the extent rates have to go higher and stay higher for longer it becomes harder to see the path,” Powell said. “I would say the path has narrowed over the course of the last year.”The Fed began its current rate hike cycle in March after inflation rose to 7.9% in February. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June and today's report shows that pace falling below the February rate for the first time.While bitcoin is having only a modest rally, equity futures are soaring on thoughts the inflation slowdown might mean the Fed's tightening cycle could be over sooner than previously feared.

455,"Will central bank digital currencies (CBDC) replace cash and bank transfers in the future? And will they be an ultimate tool for financial surveillance and control? Or is another, more benign, future possible?David Chaum, creator of the Bitcoin predecessor eCash and, more recently, the elixxir cryptocurrency, believes the democratic world can have a version of CBDCs that protects privacy. He is working with the Swiss National Bank (SNB) on Project Tourbillon, designed for privacy-focused central bank money.The project will be developed under the auspices of the Bank of International Settlements’ (BIS) Innovation Hub, the organization announced on Thursday. The project will add to the range of CBDC pilots already in the works by the BIS Innovation Hub, like the projects Helvetia and Mariana – both involving the SNB, too.The technology underlying the Project Tourbillon will combine privacy preserving functions and quantum-resistant cryptography developed by Chaum, the BIS announcement says. The system will also be scalable as it will be “using an architecture that is compatible with, but not based on, distributed ledger technology,” the press release reads.The concept, based on Chaum’s blind signature technique, has been outlined in a joint research paper by Chaum and Thomas Moser, alternate member of the SNB governing board.According to Morten Bech, head of the BIS Innovation Hub Swiss Centre, the project allows to avoid trade-offs between cyber resilience, scalability and user privacy. “Project Tourbillon will build and test a prototype that reconciles these trade-offs and pushes central banks' technological frontier,"" Bech said in the BIS announcement.The prototype is slated to be completed by mid-2023.According to Chaum, the SNB first approached him last year about his eCash technology and he took it as a chance to prove that a CBDC can be designed in a privacy-protecting fashion. Speaking with CoinDesk in an exclusive interview, he pointed out China as an example of omnipresent digital surveillance by the government. China’s central bank has one of the world’s most advanced CBDC projects, with 100 billion yuan (US$13.9 billion) in transactions already completed.The U.S. and Europe can do better, Chaum believes. He acknowledges that “CBDCs are a big deal” in the world at the moment and is well aware of the fact that many believe CBDCs will be “the end of privacy in money.”“It’s incredibly ironic for me that something I’ve been working on 40 years ago has become the actual pivotal distinction between the East and West – privacy in payments,” Chaum said.“It really becomes a choice: Are we going to have a kind of protection we are entitled to and that distinguishes us as a human rights-based democracy, or we basically are going to have the same thing as in China,” he added.Chaum says the eCash 2.0 technology he created and described in the paper with SNB’s Moser, is a “superior payment system” with both privacy and anti-counterfeiting protection built into it.He believes it’s important to show that a CBDC can actually preserve privacy so that no government can say it’s impossible and use it as an excuse to build something similar to the Chinese model.In another scenario, a government might be willing to maintain privacy in developing its CBDC, but at some point that government can discover that criminals are using those privacy features to conceal illegal activities. That in turn can become a reason to abandon the idea of privacy altogether.Chaum believes the technology he invented can prevent both scenarios: preventing anyone from tracing how people use their money and, at the same time, allowing the law enforcement to track criminal funds.How this works in practice is not easy to unpack.The eCash 2.0 model has two tiers when it comes to issuing central bank digital money: a central bank does it via commercial banks, which onboard users. To get some CBDC on their digital wallets, users need to request it from banks with which they already have accounts. Banks perform know your customer diligence and send a specific authentication code to the central bank so that money can be issued.Cryptographic mechanics of eCash 2.0 allow central banks to issue those coins to a user without knowing which user exactly owns specific coins, says Mario Yaksetig, the project’s cryptographer. Neither knows the commercial bank that onboarded the user, although both the central and commercial banks know how much money in CBDC a known user received from the system.A central bank holds a blockchain-based ledger of all the valid coin identifiers, Yaksetig said, so no one can forge new coins, but transactions between wallets are not recorded on a blockchain. “There is no record of transactions whatsoever,” Yaksetig told CoinDesk.However, users can voluntarily give up the privacy of their coins if they want law enforcement to trace stolen funds. For this, a user would need to reveal his unique cryptographic key to, say, the police, and then the police can see when these stolen coins are being spent at a restaurant, a store or other kind of merchant, because merchants, unlike individual users, would be known to the system. So the police would be able to find where that merchant is, go there and arrest the thieves, Chaum said.Alternatively, instead of going to the police, a robbed or scammed user might request reissuance of his money using his unique key, Chaum said, so he can spend those coins before the criminals do.Asked if a government building a CBDC can use what he created to make a system that can be surveilled and censored, making crypto’s worst fears about CBDCs come true, Chaum believes his technology is ill-suited for that.“There is no way to use it for evil because all it does is protect privacy,” he said. You can opt to use decentralized cryptocurrencies if you wish, but “if you choose to use government-issued money, the government should not be able to see how you spend it,” he added.",2022/11/10

Bitcoin has dropped by nearly 20% during the past two weeks as the bear market shows its ugly claws.Analysts say that a continued widening of the GBTC discount shows a weakening institutional demand for bitcoin, combined with the ready availability of bitcoin exchange-traded funds for retail.In a note to CoinDesk, Henry Liu, CEO of BTSE, a trading infrastructure provider, said that the GBTC discount hitting such extreme levels is because of the liquidity crunch post FTX's collapse.""This has resulted in thinning liquidity, wider spreads, and increasing volatility across the industry, particularly for BTC,"" Liu said.GBTC is a close-ended fund, meaning BTC deposits are perpetually locked, but GBTC shares can be sold on the market after a six-month lockup.In June, Grayscale launched a suit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which denied the company’s application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an exchange-traded fund.Three Arrows Capital was a large holder of GBTC, and told Bloomberg in July that arbitrage trading the premium was one of the factors that led to the collapse of the fund.Grayscale and CoinDesk share the same parent company, Digital Currency Group.",2022/11/10

The decline continued bitcoin's downward trend this week following the rapid unraveling of crypto exchange giant FTX, which suffered a liquidity crisis and was then jilted by would-be rescuer Binance.Ether followed a similar pattern, tumbling below $1,100 for the first time since mid-summer before regaining a small swathe of lost ground. The second-largest crypto in market value was recently changing hands at about $1,140, off more than 12% from Tuesday, same time. ETH had been hovering over $1,500 for the past two weeks.Other major cryptocurrencies continued to plunge for a third consecutive day as investors fretted over every development in an industry already rocked by calamities involving crypto giants Terraform Labs, Three Arrows Capital and Celsius Network.FTX’s FTT token recently dropped almost 55% a day after plummeting about 80% and was trading at just $2.34. The Solana platform’s SOL token recently fell almost 40% to continue its downward momentum of recent days. Last week, CoinDesk reported that a copy of FTX sister company Alameda's balance sheet showed the firm held $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.” Even Binance’s BNB token was down about 15% after outperforming most other cryptos on Tuesday.The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, was down 3%.A day after U.S. midterm elections, stocks saw their first red of the week, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropping 2.4% and 2%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was off 1.9%. Safe haven gold ticked down slightly.In an email, Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote that the FTX debacle and its much-admired CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, has shaken an industry often criticized for its lack of guardrails.“Sam Bankman-Fried was supposed to be bulletproof,” Moya wrote. “SBF was crypto’s ‘white knight’ and the implosion of FTX means no one is safe. The stabilization period for crypto is over and now we wait to see if other contagion risks emerge.”Moya added: ""Cryptos are under intense pressure as contagion risks remain elevated from the FTX liquidity crisis. No one wants to touch anything that has ties with FTX and that is troubling news.""Crypto Exchange BitMEX Publishes Proof of Reserves Ahead of Friday’s BMEX ListingBy Shaurya MalwaCrypto exchange BitMEX was among the first players to publish updated proof-of-reserves of their crypto holdings as fear gripped markets amid FTX’s liquidity crisis.Crypto exchanges are now scrambling to publicly publish their fund reserves. On Wednesday alone, nine exchanges – Binance, Gate.io, KuCoin, Poloniex, Bitget, Huobi, OKX, Deribit and Bybit – separately issued statements that they would publish their Merkle tree reserve certificates to increase transparency.Publishing proofs can take one month, but OKX Director of Finan to publish results, BitMEX opted for a simpler way: “All BitMEX has done here is publish a basic list of the reserves. The list contains all the bitcoin we have under our custody on behalf of our clients, it is as simple as that,” the exchange said in a Wednesday post.While most exchanges said they would use Merkle tree processing to publish results, BitMEX opted fora simpler way: “All BitMEX has done here is publish a basic list of the reserves. The list contains all the Bitcoin we have under our custody on behalf of our clients, it is as simple as that,” the exchange said in a Wednesday post.

460,"The past week has seen a dizzying downward spiral for Sam Bankman-Fried’s huge crypto empire. Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange has paused withdrawals, and a tentative bailout from rival Binance appears to be kaput. That could put depositor funds at risk, and certainly spells a major setback for not only Bankman-Fried but for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.These downfalls aren’t rare in crypto, which is subject to extreme boom-bust cycles. But FTX and Bankman-Fried are unique in the stature they achieved before self-immolating. Over the past three years, FTX has come to be widely regarded as a reputable exchange, despite not submitting to U.S. regulation. Bankman-Fried has himself become globally influential, thanks to his thoughts on cryptocurrency regulation and his financial support for U.S. electoral candidates – not necessarily in that order.These narratives about both FTX and Bankman-Fried are now clearly dead in the water, given recent evidence that everything was not as it seemed at the exchange, or at Bankman-Fried’s other firm, Alameda Research.The questions to answer in the coming days will be: What happened? And why did almost nobody see it coming?What follows is the most important context for understanding this ongoing story. That includes the sudden crisis of confidence driven by revelations about Sam Bankman-Fried’s accounting practices; the added shock of the unwind thanks to Bankman-Fried’s golden-boy reputation; and the complex role of competitor Binance and its founder, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, in the crisis.Facts first uncovered by CoinDesk played a major role in the events of the past week. On Nov. 2, reporter Ian Allison published findings that roughly $5.8 billion out of $14.6 billion of assets on the balance sheet at Alameda Research, based on then-current valuations, were linked to FTX’s exchange token, FTT.This finding, based on leaked internal documents, was explosive because of the very close relationship between Alameda and FTX. Both were founded by Bankman-Fried, and there has been significant anxiety about the extent and nature of their fraternal dealings. The FTT token was essentially created from thin air by FTX, inviting questions about the real-world, open-market value of FTT tokens held in reserve by affiliated entities.Negative speculation about a financial institution can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, triggering withdrawals out of a sense of uncertainty and leading to the very liquidity problems that were feared. Since publication of Allison’s initial story, CoinDesk reporters have been advised to practice extreme caution and diligence in reporting about FTT and other matters at Alameda and FTX.But sometimes straightforward facts are enough to trigger an entirely justified bank run. Seemingly because of their known close ties, worries about Alameda’s balance sheet translated into a rapidly accelerating mass exodus from FTX. The exchange saw $6 billion in withdrawals in the 72 hours before things reached a head on the morning of Nov. 8, according to internal messages seen by Reuters.According to Coinglass data, that for a time left FTX with a balance of, unbelievably, just one bitcoin. That has now rebounded to 36 BTC, compared to more than half a million BTC each held by Coinbase and Binance.Read More: FTX Balances Tumbled 87% in 5 Days in Epic Crypto Deposit Run, Data ShowsThis rush to the exits reportedly led Bankman-Fried and his team to begin frantically shopping for an acquisition partner, approaching a variety of potential partners before Binance entered the picture.It remains worryingly unclear, though, exactly why even such a dramatic rush for the exits would have led FTX to seek its own bailout. The exchange promised users that it would not speculate with cryptocurrencies held in their accounts. But if that policy was followed, there should have been no pause to withdrawals, nor any balance sheet gap to fill. One possible explanation comes from Coinmetrics analyst Lucas Nuzzi, who has presented what he says is evidence that FTX transferred funds to Alameda in September, perhaps as a loan to backstop Alameda’s losses.The crisis also seemed to validate anxieties about what Alameda’s immense holdings of FTT-linked assets meant for the stability of Bankman-Fried’s empire. The market value of the token is down more than 80% over the past week.Late in the day on Nov. 8, after the announcement of a tentative deal with Binance, FTX said it had officially suspended all crypto withdrawals.As striking as the numbers are, the greater significance of FTX’s collapse may be in how it upends a long-running narrative about SBF himself. As apparent frauds like Terra and Celsius unwound in the first half of 2022, triggering contagion across other crypto entities, Bankman-Fried was often seen both as a sane and sober counterpoint, and as a well-resourced backstop ready to rescue the entire ecosystem.Bankman-Fried’s endeavors included loans to or moves to acquire faltering crypto lender BlockFi, lender Voyager Digital and Anthony Scarammucci’s Skybridge Capital hedge fund. Alameda Research also led a funding round for the Facebook-linked Aptos blockchain in late July, at a time when investment funds were drying up.In his role as a funder of last resort, Bankman-Fried was frequently described, including by CoinDesk, as “the J.P. Morgan of crypto” – referring not to the Jamie Dimon-run investment bank, but to its robber-baron founder. Twice around the turn of the 19th century, in 1893 and 1907, Morgan stepped in to support emerging financial markets through a crisis with his own funds.But there have been increasing signs that this framing was, at best, oversimplified. Bankman-Fried teased many more deals than actually went through, for instance backing out after a tentative move to acquire Celsius. Many of these deals arguably flowed money back to FTX or Alameda. And some of the headline numbers may have exaggerated exactly how much real money was on the line.All of this is particularly relevant because of the profile Bankman-Fried has worked to build as a political influencer, both on general policy and crypto regulation specifically. Though the precise connection to this week’s crisis is a bit opaque, Bankman-Fried faced a wave of blowback in late October over a series of crypto regulation proposals. He was also a major donor to the U.S. Democratic Party.By one preliminary estimate, this week’s disaster means Bankman-Fried is no longer a billionaire personally. That doesn’t entirely preclude future political influence via donations, but it will certainly constrain him. More significant is that Bankman-Fried’s credibility as a policy advisor, on finance or anything else, has been left in tatters – a washout for his “effective altruism” agenda.Easily the most fascinating element of the current debacle is the role of Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, founder and head of Binance, the world’s largest centralized crypto exchange by volume. CZ and Bankman-Fried have been occasional collaborators over the past few years, but recent interactions have suggested rising interpersonal and business tension.Zhao and Binance also materially contributed to FTX’s meltdown – though it’s unclear whether that was his intent. Apparently in reaction to CoinDesk’s reporting about the predominance of FTT on Alameda’s balance sheet, Zhao on Nov. 6 announced that Binance would liquidate a large remaining balance of FTT tokens distributed to it as part of a prior sell-off of FTX equity.In a truly bizarre move, Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison quickly and very publicly offered Zhao an over-the-counter deal to buy the tokens at $22 each. That’s confounding both because the public offer seemed to expose anxiety within Alameda about the market impact of Binance’s sale, and because Ellison’s offer was slightly below FTT’s public exchange price at the time – not exactly much incentive to help Alameda out.Zhao initially framed Binance’s sell-off as benignly as possible, insisting, “Regarding any speculation as to whether this is a move against a competitor, it is not.”But later the same day, Zhao muddied that claim with a more barbed statement.“Liquidating our FTT is just post-exit risk management, learning from LUNA,” he wrote. “We gave support before, but we won't pretend to make love after divorce. We are not against anyone. But we won't support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs. Onwards.”The comparison to LUNA is particularly venomous, given that its creator, Do Kwon, is currently an international fugitive evading charges of financial fraud in South Korea. Zhao’s allusion to lobbying efforts also give the impression that there’s something personal at play here.Zhao may have taken a dim view of a since-deleted tweet by Bankman-Fried that seemed to cast aspersions on Zhao’s Chinese ancestry. Zhao is Canadian, and has for many years bridled at suggestions that Binance is a Chinese firm.All of this has led to speculation that Zhao has been playing four-dimensional chess against Bankman-Fried and FTX. Zhao himself later described his announcement of a large FTT sale as “the straw that broke the camel’s back,” undermining confidence in FTX at a key moment. Zhao has denied ill intent or calculation, but this was hard to credit as of Nov. 8, with Binance poised to acquire a competitor after making moves that seriously weakened it.Then came more CoinDesk reporting Wednesday morning, since confirmed by other outlets, that Binance would likely back out of the deal after a preliminary examination of FTX’s finances. It may be some time until we fully understand exactly what Zhao saw when he got a peek behind the curtain – but it’s probably nothing good.",2022/11/09
461,"Betting on Sam Bankman-Fried, the once-beloved poster boy and “white knight” of crypto, was supposed to be safe. But recent events have shown that’s far from the truth.Following on the heels of the Terra ecosystem collapse, the Celsius Network insolvency and the Three Arrows Capital blow up, the crypto industry fell into even greater turmoil this week after SBF’s FTX crypto exchange was forced to seek a bailout amid liquidity issues.While a non-binding deal with competitor Binance stemmed the panic for a short time Tuesday, things took an even darker turn after CoinDesk on Wednesday morning reported that Binance was highly unlikely to go through with its proposed acquisition. By late Wednesday afternoon, Binance itself confirmed that the deal is off, sending crypto markets plunging even further. Bitcoin (BTC) sank below $16,000 for the first time in two years.Unless another buyer is waiting in the wings, Binance’s exit from the acquisition likely seals the fate for FTX and, with that, trust in the crypto industry will further decline from both retail and institutional investors.“A lot of normal users will lose their money, so this will be catastrophic for the ecosystem in the short term,” said Jay Jog, co-founder of layer 1 blockchain Sei Network. “There will be degraded confidence in crypto in the short term, both from an institutional standpoint and from a retail standpoint,” he added.That sentiment was echoed by SmartBlocks founder Mark Fidelman, who told CoinDesk, “If the deal between FTX and Binance doesn't happen, we'll need to see another major player step in like Coinbase to bail them out. Otherwise, trust will further erode in the crypto market and we'll all suffer for at least six months to a year.”“This also sets back our industry as far as growth and trust across other industries that are looking to support and get involved with crypto, and it will also affect other players in the crypto space that have assets tied and connected to FTX,” said Dan Edlebeck, head of ecosystem at Sei Network.Read more: Who Still Has Exposure to FTX?However, it may not be a total exodus for institutional investors as they already have a large presence in the sector. “Whatever the outcome is, I don’t think it will lead to institutional investors significantly pulling money from the sector,” said Kevin March, co-founder of cryptocurrency prime brokerage firm Floating Point Group. “Anyone that is here right now, is here to stay … We’re still having conversations with institutions [that] are interested and trying to figure out how to enter the space this week despite the backdrop,” he added.",2022/11/09

Bitcoin has been swept up in the cryptocurrency industry’s latest crisis, FTX’s liquidity issues, a mass exodus from the exchange and proposed sale to rival Binance that collapsed.

Other major cryptocurrencies continued to plunge for a third consecutive day as investors fretted over every development in an industry already rocking from calamities involving crypto giants Terraform Labs, Three Arrows Capital and Celsius Network.FTX’s FTT token had recently dropped almost 50% a day after plummeting about 80% and was trading at just $2.62. The Solana platform’s SOL token had recently fallen more than 45% to continue its downward momentum of recent days. Last week, CoinDesk reported that a copy of FTX sister company Alameda's balance sheet showed the firm held $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.” Even Binance’s BNB token was down about 15% after outperforming most other cryptos on Tuesday.The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, was down 8%.A day after U.S. midterm elections, stocks saw their first red of the week, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropping 2.4% and 2%, respectively.

YoungStablecoinsUnderstanding the volatility stemming from the FTX drama continues with stablecoin outflows. According to Nansen data, in the past seven days starting on Monday, Nov. 7, FTX led all exchanges in stablecoin outflows. Some $451 million worth of stablecoins have left FTX, more than the combined outflows of KuCoin, Crypto.com and OKX.Specifically, FTX’s holdings of USDC and USDT have nosedived dramatically. Between Friday, Nov. 4, and Tuesday, Nov. 8, Nansen data shows FTX’s USDC holdings dropped about $137 million, roughly 84%, while its USDT holdings dropped from $198 million to $68 million.According to CryptoQuant, FTX’s stablecoin reserve stands at roughly $156 million currently, down more than 78% since Oct. 24.Read the full technical take here.

463,"The rise and fall of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange has already had a profound impact on the industry. Bankman-Fried is among the most influential political dealers in crypto, and so regulators and politicians will likely notice that the exchange he built has collapsed.That FTX may (or may not) be bought by Binance, its largest rival and earliest backer, is significant. While Binance has made serious steps towards transparency in recent years, it is also a stand-in for crypto’s seeming intransigence.No one knows, for instance, where Binance is officially located or how wealthy is its founder, Changpeng Zhao. If Binance acquires FTX – preventing a bank run that it helped foment – questions will be raised. Regulators are already hyper-sensitive to monopolistic behavior in tech, and wasn’t crypto supposed to provide an alternative model?If there is one lesson from this ongoing crisis, it’s the need for transparency. The irony that Bankman-Fried has advocated for reducing financial privacy and abstruse licensing models for crypto should not be lost – SBF’s Alameda Research and FTX were tied up in dangerous, unsustainable ways the world is only beginning to understand.See also: The Story of Sam Bankman-Fried's Backroom Deal With BinanceThis is a “dynamic situation,” to steal Zhao’s phrase, and can change by the hour. CoinDesk reached out to a number of regulatory, financial and technological experts for their take on what it all means. In short, whatever happens, the effects will be wide-reaching.The Blockchain Association’s Kristin Smith discusses conversations likely happening on Capitol Hill while former New York State Department of Financial Services regulator Matt Homer breaks down the challenges of global enforcement. Others examine using zero-knowledge proofs to show exchanges are solvent, while some others discuss buying opportunities.The ultimate meltdown of the internet market [around] 2001 demonstrated a lot of the interconnections that you might not have predicted, which may be at play here in the possible merger. … Whenever there's a question of Chinese investment in a technologically innovative business, a lot of antennas go up. On the one hand, there's no question the Biden administration has been much more aggressive about antitrust enforcement than we've seen. We saw this with the rejection of Penguin Simon Schuster publishing deal.[Crypto] is such an immature market that I don't know what the conversations might be inside the FTC [Federal Trading Commission] or inside the Department of Justice. I don’t know how traditional antitrust actors would think about a market that is this volatile [and] that is changing this rapidly.– U.S. Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), on CoinDesk TVIt's important to remember that Binance.US and FTX.US are not part of this deal. So U.S. retail customers should not at least, at this stage, be caught up in the deal that is being negotiated.That being said, lawmakers are very much paying attention to this because Sam [Bankman-Fried] has spent a lot of time in Washington, D.C., and does personally know a lot of the policymakers. And so it’s going to invite a lot of scrutiny into how centralized exchanges should be regulated. It’s interesting, because what happened with FTX may not be able to be addressed by U.S. regulation.Congress is very interested, as we've seen this past year, in finding a way to regulate the spot markets and exchanges registered with the CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] and potentially the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission]. Part of that could mean having some sort of proof of reserves and guidelines around what you're supposed to do with customer deposits.There’s an expectation with crypto customers when they're keeping their crypto on exchanges that it’s not being taken and lent out and doing something else, like it would be with a bank. This is going to open up a more robust debate around exchange regulation.– Kristin Smith, executive director of Blockchain Association, on CoinDesk TVWhile the FTX story is still unfolding, one of the most important lessons we might eventually take from it is that prudential regulation and supervision matters. Let’s break that down. Regulation means rules and requirements. Supervision means ongoing oversight through means such as examinations and reporting. And prudential means safety and soundness, or financial condition.In contrast to conduct regulators, who care primarily about how you conduct yourself in the marketplace (Are you providing appropriate disclosures? Are you treating customers fairly? etc.), prudential regulators are concerned with the financial health of your company (Are you solvent? Do you have sufficient capital reserves? How susceptible are you to market contagion?).This type of regulation is especially needed for opaque market actors. And if there’s one thing we’ve learned several times over this year it’s that the centralized crypto players are a pretty opaque bunch. And they’re global, making the web of lines connecting them to each other difficult to determine.See also: Does the US Government Have a Monopoly on Trust? | Matt HomerIt turns out that for these types of centralized actors having a regulator examine their books and set capital requirements that are commensurate with the risks posed is pretty important. While there’s a lot of talk over which conduct regulator in Washington, D.C., should rule the roost, it seems we’ve forgotten about a more foundational element of regulation and supervision: ensuring a company is financially sound.– Matt Homer, venture capitalist, crypto adviser and former NYDFS regulatorIt's incredible how quickly these things can spiral out of control. FTX was the crypto giant offering to acquire the assets of bankrupt crypto platforms (like Voyager Digital) and signing loans to other entities (BlockFi) not that long ago, and now they're sinking.It was hard not to notice how [Binance CEO] CZ really seemed to be hedging things in his tweets:""we signed a non-binding LOI, intending to fully acquire FTX.""""we will be conducting a full DD in the coming days.""""This is a highly dynamic situation, and we are assessing the situation in real time. Binance has the discretion to pull out from the deal at any time.""I'm giving it decent odds that the deal doesn't go through, or that Binance threatens to pull out if they're not given very friendly terms. It's remarkable, again and again, how crypto personalities like SBF will claim that everything is fine up until the very second they have to admit it isn't. I think it's because so much of crypto is dependent on the belief that things are going well – as evidenced by the fact that FTX was floating along for quite some time with this overinflated balance sheet until it suddenly became apparent to the public that things were not OK behind the scenes.Sam's last tweet before the acquisition deal announcement was him saying ""A competitor [Binance] is trying to go after us with false rumors. FTX is fine. Assets are fine."" It's all very reminiscent of Do Kwon's tweets as Terra was collapsing all around him. ""So, is this $UST depeg in the room with us right now?"" ""Deploying more capital - steady lads""I'm curious what will happen to Alameda, which as far as I can tell is not included in the Binance deal. They are almost certainly in trouble, and the cascading effects from [the hedge fund’s] insolvency could be massive. I am also curious what effect this will have on crypto legislation. SBF has spent a lot of time in D.C. schmoozing with lawmakers and giving recommendations on possible crypto regulation, acting as the ""adult in the room"" and the liaison from the crypto industry.If I was those legislators, I would be questioning a lot of his suggestions after seeing what was happening behind the scenes at FTX that whole time, and it would be another blow to my trust of the crypto industry to see a prominent member of it that I potentially trusted had been on such shaky ground.– Molly White, crypto skeptic, founder of Web3 Is Going Just GreatPerhaps it’s time we take seriously the blatant and obvious conflicts of interest that dominate the cryptocurrency industry.– Bennett Tomlin, co-host of the “Crypto Critics' Corner” podcastExchanges not adequately safeguarding customer’s deposits has been a recurring theme within crypto. From the early days of Mt. Gox to the recent troubles of FTX (and innumerable events in between), hacks and thefts have occurred leaving consumers holding empty bags.Transparency and openness have always been the key to operating an exchange. While many exchanges have started the process of providing on-chain proof of reserves, such proofs alone cannot completely solve the problem as exchanges may not necessarily disclose to the public the balances of all their clients.Even if exchanges redacted private customer information and displayed account balances publicly or, better yet, used secure computing techniques to conceal their clients’ data but proved the sum of the balances, the skeptic could rightfully say an exchange may not be including all information. This scenario reflects the adage of “garbage-in, garbage-out.”– Matthew Niemerg, co-founder at Aleph ZeroCases like this further emphasize the need for self custody and infrastructure that is built to support decentralization. The near-collapse of FTX also highlights the urgency to hold centralized entities, like [centralized exchanges], accountable for any damage done in such instances.That’s because they’re failing to deliver under its promise to safeguard users' funds. In [decentralized finance] this problem is solved by code. We have self-custody to make sure users aren’t vulnerable when those in charge are being reckless.– Paulina Jóśków, head of business development at RampOne of the main reasons we have regulation is to prevent people from being defrauded before it happens. Without regulation, we’d have to rely solely on deterrence by after-the-fact civil and criminal litigation. One inherent problem with this prevention approach, though, is that it’s an enormous amount of work! In the extreme, it’s obviously impossible for an agency to check everything and everyone.The people most likely to mislead the public are also the most likely to mislead regulators, so a dynamic is created wherein do-gooders bear an increasing regulatory burden while the actual targets of regulation simply lie about adhering to the same regulations.No doubt, FTX is going to increase regulatory scrutiny of crypto. That’s sad, because the best form of prevention is transparency to the public. Crowdsourcing audits is inherently more scalable than a centralized review, and thus decentralized finance (DeFi) is a long-term answer to this core problem of regulation.Hopefully, regulators will avoid conflating DeFi crypto with CeFi crypto so they don’t hamstring the solution to the very problem they are trying to solve.– Mark Lurie, CEO of Shipyard SoftwareThe last year has taught the crypto industry, and those investing in it, some harsh lessons about the future of digital currencies – FTX’s troubles only underline them further.Firstly, never use a token you created as collateral, as FTX, Celsius Network and [Terra] all did. If you create a token, you have to have the cash available behind it for withdrawals. Tether is continually being asked about the assets backing [its stablecoin]. Relatively recently, USDT had 17% of its token redeemed – the cash has to be there instantly.Secondly, we heard a lot in the run-up to these events about “using capital efficiently.” The liquidity pressures that ultimately led to the situations at these brokers and lenders means all crypto businesses should have large reserves to draw on and certainly shouldn’t rely on borrowing to fund themselves.Binance’s acquisition of FTX marks a fulcrum for the digital asset industry. This acquisition may have prevented a black swan event, but will it help the industry in the long term? Consolidation of exchanges may be necessary but, as ever, fewer players means less competition.See also: Why Is Crypto Tanking: The FTX-Binance Drama ExplainedMarkets have obviously dropped significantly on the back of the news about FTX, but that was to be expected. You wouldn’t rule out further bad news to come. Subsequently, I expect there to be further falls in the value of BTC and ETH, as there will be massive losses from this latest debacle.– Temple Melville, CEO of Scotcoin I’ll be very happy to see Binance help individual customers avoid losing out from the hubris and bad decisions made by another centralized exchange that positioned itself as a sensible and trustworthy operator.However, this, like the financial crisis of 2008, demonstrates the need for transparency to ensure that participants in the financial system can make decisions with their eyes open, and for self-custody to ensure that no person or company has to place their assets at risk in order to access financial products and services.That is the promise and benefit of DeFi, and the reason that DeFi will succeed over the long term.– Barney Mannerings, co-founder of Vega ProtocolThe FTX/Binance situation highlights the risks of poor disclosure. When “off-chain activities” unexpectedly become public, market participants will be shocked. In other financial markets, intermediaries entrusted with client assets are required to regularly file statements of financial condition, which clarify to customers and counterparties the risks they are assuming when transacting with that party.In DeFi protocols, these requirements are primarily satisfied by the protocols' in-built transparency. Potential users of these protocols can compare protocol transparency and make informed choices. We believe that eventually, intermediaries such as exchanges, brokers and over-the-counter trading providers will use visibility into their financial condition as a competitive differentiator, independent of any regulatory action or requirement.– Dan Hoover, director at Castle FundsIt's highly unlikely that Binance will eventually succeed in acquiring FTX. It looks like CZ had a complete victory, but Binance will eventually pay the price for damaging the long-term interests of the industry. The joint statement tells us one fact: FTX has serious liquidity problems or even insolvency, so serious that it can no longer find people willing to save it, and can only turn to the opponents who started this war.Why would Binance spend money to acquire it? FTX doesn't have a U.S. license (so it's nonsense to acquire FTX to get a regulatory advantage). Acquiring its users or the tech system? Huh. FTX is dead, and its users will naturally choose to go to Binance regardless.Acquiring FTX isn't a valuable trade, and CZ's goal is already achieved. Even if Binance buys FTX, it's damaging to the industry and a humiliation to decentralization. For Binance, it might be a short term victory written into a case study, but will backfire Binance in the long term.– Gracy Chen, managing director of BitgetLiquidity and access to capital is the foundation of a financial ecosystem. Every investor and every innovator who is banking on cryptocurrencies needs to feel secure that there are trustworthy on and off-ramps. We are encouraged by this preemptive move by two titans in the industry to ensure ongoing stability for further, stable innovation.– Anna Becker, CEO of EndoTechFTX’s overnight implosion and subsequent forced acquisition by Binance highlights the danger of highly centralized, opaque operations that continue to govern the crypto ecosystem.Crypto has the potential to change the world in a positive way but will only be able to unlock its full potential to give everyone in the world access to secure digital money once crypto companies start to consistently uphold strong, transparent business practices. Centralized companies like FTX that have tied their fortunes to coins without proven value will ultimately only wrong their consumers and disadvantage themselves.Bitcoin was created to serve as a secure, independent store of value that is not reliant on any one centralized power. Bitcoin thereby solves the problems that countless companies like FTX continue to encounter by relying on their own tokens. We will continue to see this effect in crypto until companies recognize that they cannot secure their or their clients’ wealth in centralized assets that are ultimately baseless stores of value.– Alex Adelman, CEO of LolliA deal between Binance and FTX may strengthen the monopoly of certain trading platforms. At the same time, the importance of checking exchange reserves is also clearly being emphasized – this will be a top-of-mind topic at least in the nearest month. As a result, weaker players will leave the competition.– Serhii Zhdanov, CEO of EXMO.com",2022/11/09
464,"Struggling trading firm Alameda Research, sister company of crypto exchange FTX that appears to be suffering from a blockchain-era deposit run, withdrew some $37 million in the form of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) – a type of bitcoin derivative – from the FTX.US crypto exchange on Wednesday.It's unclear what the motive is for the token movements, and the amount is likely just a fraction of the firm's holdings; prior to the recent crypto markets crash, in June, its balance sheet included at least $14.6 billion of assets.But the observation of the withdrawal – visible in transaction data on the Ethereum blockchain – offers a glimpse of a troubled company scrambling behind the scenes to arrange its finances. Crypto market analysts have speculated that the trading firm might be searching for liquidity while trying to satisfy demands from creditors.Based on Ethereum blockchain data from the crypto intelligence platform Arkham Intelligence, a wallet associated with Alameda withdrew 2,262 wBTC in four separate transactions within minutes from crypto exchange FTX.US.Later, it sent 3,000 wBTC tokens, worth of $50 million, to an address labeled as ""Wrapped Bitcoin: Controller.""The trading volume on FTX.US for WBTC has been about $10,000 in the past 24 hours, meaning that there is no market depth on the exchange if someone would sell large amount of the token.A spokesperson of FTX.US declined to comment. Alameda did not immediately respond to an inquiry.FTX.US is a U.S.-based entity for American users, separate from the crypto exchange FTX but still part of the erstwhile billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire.FTX halted user withdrawals on Tuesday after users rush to pull their cryptocurrencies out. The rival Binance exchange made a bailout offer to FTX, but now it is reportedly backing out of a deal, CoinDesk reported.Alameda Research, a large market maker on FTX, is under immense pressure as it scrambles for liquidity. Its website went dark and has not communicated recently with the public.",2022/11/09
465,"Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by volume, said Tuesday it would purchase FTX, effectively bailing out its main competitor and marking one of the most shocking turns of events in the history of crypto to date.Late Wednesday, Binance reversed course, saying the issues at FTX were ""beyond our control or ability to help.""Although the Binance-FTX takeover deal collapsed, the spectacle around it crowned the founder and CEO of Binance, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, as a kind of crypto king – solidifying his reputation as a brilliant tactician but raising concerns that he might be amassing a disproportionate amount of power in the “decentralized” world of cryptocurrency.On the other hand, the events severely tainted the reputation and fortunes of Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old altruist investor who was, until recently, considered a kind of crypto wunderkind and destined to profit as handsomely as anyone from the sector’s meteoric rise. According to Bloomberg’s billionaire index, the FTX blowup torpedoed SBF’s net worth by 94%, from $16 billion to below $1 billion.But Tuesday’s story was more than a spat between two billionaires with initials for nicknames.The events sparked turmoil across the wider cryptocurrency markets – plunging bitcoin and other currencies to two-year lows. The token for Solana (SOL), a popular competitor to the Ethereum blockchain in which FTX held a major stake, was one of the biggest losers – falling nearly 50% on Wednesday, and down 93% from its 2021 high.Though FTX’s implosion says nothing about the core technology behind crypto, it will erode trust in the industry and strike ire among regulators eager to tame it.Confused? You’re not alone. Let’s break down what happened.Leaked documents last week from CoinDesk, and the market’s reaction to what they contained, pulled the mask off SBF to show that his crypto exchange firm FTX – like so many failed exchanges before it – was at risk of insolvency.The events revealed the FTX exchange – which allows users to buy and sell crypto – may not have been backing user funds 1:1 behind the scenes.A bank run – instigated in large part by tweets from CZ – seized on this apparent vulnerability in the SBF empire, driving SBF’s crown jewel into the hands of its main competitor for a possible bailout.With the deal now apparently not going through, investors are left unsure if they’ll be able to recover their funds.Documents uncovered last week by CoinDesk showed that Alameda Research – a trading and investment juggernaut founded by SBF – had its finances deeply intertwined with those of FTX.FTX was supposed to be a separate company from Alameda, but Alameda apparently held a disproportionate amount of its balance sheet in FTX’s exchange token, FTT. That token was illiquid, with Alameda and FTX owning a vast majority of all of the tokens in circulation. Selling them would have meant crashing the price of FTT, meaning their value on Alameda’s balance sheet was likely overstated.When documents showed that Alameda had been borrowing millions of dollars against FTT, rumors spread across Twitter that FTX was loaning out user funds to Alameda and using its own illiquid FTT token as collateral – essentially printing money so it could lend user funds to itself.These rumors are far from confirmed, but they were the first inkling for many that deposits in the FTX exchange were not as safe as hoped.CZ seized on this skepticism in his tweets, stating that Binance would be unwinding its own position in the FTT token over the span of a few months (In another odd footnote to this story, Binance was one of FTX’s largest early investors, meaning it had a huge number of FTT tokens and plenty of power to sway its price).When CZ announced that he would be dumping FTT onto the market, other holders of the token took note, panic-selling their FTT tokens and racing to withdraw funds from FTX as rumors of insolvency circulated.FTX was eventually forced to pause user withdrawals on Tuesday morning – causing chaos within the crypto markets. After Coinbase, OKX and perhaps other firms passed on SBF’s requests for rescue capital, he swallowed his pride and went to CZ for help.Binance’s acquisition of FTX’s non-US operations, which apparently fell apart after Binance took a look at the FTX books, would have plugged a hole in FTX’s balance sheet that may total more than a billion dollars. FTX has a separate U.S. entity, FTX.US, that was not impacted by the acquisition or insolvency.A Binance purchase of FTX would not have been unlike Bank of America’s buyout of Merrill Lynch during the 2008 financial crisis, which saved the firm from bankruptcy and saved depositors from losing all of their funds although it did require a subsequent bailout from the U.S. government.Now that the deal has fallen apart, depositors in FTX risk losing some of their funds unless someone else is willing to come to the rescue, which may not happen depending on the size of the hole in FTX’s balance sheet. If a rescue doesn't come, the next step for FTX may be to declare bankruptcy.FTX was a massive presence in cryptocurrency, sports and other industries. Whatever happens, regulators – once persuaded by SBF’s pro-government posturing – will be sure to take notice, projects (like Solana) linked to the firm will be left on shaky ground, and opponents of centralized crypto companies will be emboldened.A shocking portrait of hubris and deceit, the collapse of FTX – the impact of which will continue to ripple across the crypto universe in the coming weeks and months – will make SBF a prime target for regulators and skeptics hoping to rid the cryptocurrency industry of its wildest excesses.FTX's potential insolvency is particularly notable given SBF’s previous reputation among regulators as “one of the good guys.”A crypto golden boy, SBF was U.S. President Joe Biden’s second-largest donor in the 2020 election, a major donor in the 2022 midterms and a constant presence in Washington, D.C., seeking to provide a friendly face to regulators suspicious of the crypto industry.When the wider crypto market plunged this past spring following the $60 billion Terra project collapse, SBF fashioned himself as a sort of modern J.P. Morgan, bailing out firms such as BlockFi and Voyager Digital, which went bankrupt after mismanaging user funds behind the scenes (in much a similar fashion, it would turn out, to what FTX may have done).SBF positioned FTX in contrast to those firms, stating that he – unlike the other big players – acted responsibly with user money, never rehypothecating (or re-using) assets and losing them like with so many other failed projects.Though FTX’s collapse doesn’t speak to the core technology behind any specific cryptocurrency, it has and will damage trust in the entire industry. Specifically, it will raise questions around the power of centralized platforms – like FTX, Binance, Kraken and Coinbase – that “custody” user funds rather than leave them in users' own crypto wallets.Should FTX declare bankruptcy, user deposits will remain in limbo. We don’t know exactly what portion of user funds FTX still has on hand, but an old-fashioned bankruptcy could have a catastrophic financial impact on the whole industry, given the number of big-name institutions that have poured money into the FTX platform.UPDATE (Nov. 9, 21:20 UTC): Updated to reflect that Binance has pulled out of the deal to acquire FTX.",2022/11/09

FTX suspended withdrawals on Tuesday, but some peers and major traders still have assets stuck on the exchange.In response to the market volatility on Tuesday, Genesis, a trading firm for institutional investors, tweeted on Nov. 9 that it ""hedged and sold collateral resulting in a total loss of ~$7M across all counterparties, including Alameda.""Genesis reiterated that it has no material exposure to FTX’s native FTT token and has no lending relationship with FTX. The exchanges have a trading relationship – ""amongst other exchanges"" – but the exposure ""has no impact on our ability to serve our clients.""On Thursday, Genesis tweeted that its derivatives business currently has about $175 million in locked funds in its FTX trading account, which doesn't impact its market-making activities. The trading firm also noted that its operating capital and net positions in FTX are not material to its business and recent events surrounding FTX haven't impeded the full functioning of its trading franchise.Genesis and CoinDesk share the same parent company: Digital Currency Group.The market maker, which helps provide liquidity to crypto exchanges, reduced its exposure to FTX once the initial solvency concerns were raised.Wintermute tweeted that it has remaining funds on FTX and noted that “while this is not ideal, the amount is within our risk tolerances and does not have a significant impact on our overall financial position.”Crypto-focused venture capital firm Multicoin Capital has around 10% of the total assets under management of its Master Fund stuck as pending withdrawals on FTX, according to a letter from the firm viewed by The Block.Multicoin was able to move about 24% of its FTX-held assets before the withdrawal freeze went into effect on Tuesday. The stuck assets include bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and USD.The market maker has no exposure to FTX sister company Alameda or the FTT token, but the trading firm has been an active participant on the FTX exchange.“While we have significantly reduced our exposure over the course of the week, we still have withdrawals that have yet to be processed,” wrote the firm, noting that the stuck assets represent less than 10% of Amber Group’s total trading capital and doesn’t “pose a threat to our business operations or liquidity.”Liquid Meta (LIQQF), a decentralized finance infrastructure and technology company, used FTX for a number of services, including onboarding and offboarding currencies and coins used in its liquidity mining operations, according to a press release. The company also used FTX for overcollateralized loans used in Liquid Meta’s operations.As of Nov. 9, Liquid Meta held about $7.5 million in cash, stable coins and other digital assets via FTX, of which the company directly holds and has access to $3.2 million of borrowed stable coins and assets, leaving a net balance of approximately $4.3 million.Liquid Meta doesn’t hold any FTT tokens.European digital asset investment and trading group CoinShares disclosed “limited exposure” to FTX and no exposure to Alameda Research on Twitter. CoinShares “significantly reduced” its FTX exposure in the past week to 26.6 million British pounds ($31 million) of proprietary assets, and notes that its overall financial health remains strong.The exposure includes 190 bitcoin (BTC) to the tune of $3.1 million and 1,000 ether (ETH) worth about $1.2 million in pending withdrawals. The exposure also includes roughly $25.9 million in USD and USDC and $110,000 of other assets.Crypto-focused investment giant Pantera Capital said in blog post that most if its exposure to FTX was from ""Blockfolio acquisition proceeds, which were denominated in FTT and FTX stock."" However, it liquidated as much of FTT tokens as possible on November 8. Prior to that, FTT token positions totaled under 3% of total firm's assets under management (AUM), Pantera said.

467,"While most of the country was waiting on U.S. midterm election results on Tuesday, observers of the economy were already looking toward Thursday’s fresh inflation report.According to analysts reporting to FactSet, the U.S. Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose an estimated 8% on a year-over-year basis in October, down from the 8.2% reported in September. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, is forecast to be 0.5% against 0.6% last month.The declines come as the U.S. central bank continues its months-long quest of taming inflation without casting the economy into a steep recession. Recent economic indicators have offered faint hope that the Fed could still scale back its recent monetary hawkishness.Thursday’s data will be the first of two inflation reports before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets for the final time this year on Dec. 14-15.“That means the market impact may be more muted unless there is major divergence from the estimates,” said Jamie Dutta, market analyst at Vantage.Last week, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points for a fourth consecutive time in its ongoing effort to curb inflation, which has been stubbornly resilient. But rising short-term bond yields and a struggling stock market have prompted Fed officials to worry about financial stability risks and overtightening.The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component are down 34% and 20%, respectively this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that while “incoming data since our last meeting suggests that ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected,” it would be appropriate to slow the pace of rate increases “as soon as the next meeting.”In this week’s CPI report, the focus will be on “stickier” categories like housing and rents which aren’t expected to decline until spring next year but account for over 30% of the CPI basket, Dutta said.In addition, the Fed will also be scrutinizing services as they are most responsive to interest rates, said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. “If that gets worse, the Fed will be concerned,” he said.Last month’s CPI release showed massive growth in bitcoin’s inverse correlation relationship with the U.S. dollar, according to a report by Arcane Research.The U.S. dollar recently sank from recent highs as market makers see a potential Fed pause in the near future, which would lower gains for the dollar. Bitcoin (BTC) rose to over $21,000 on Friday after Powell's remarks last week but has since dropped sharply amid crypto exchange giant FTX’s struggles and proposed sale to rival Binance.Because of bitcoin’s inverted relationship with the dollar, a downside surprise in the CPI report this week could push the dollar down decisively, which could give bitcoin a little upside, Arcane Research said.",2022/11/09

BTIG analyst Mark Palmer said he spoke on Tuesday to Silvergate's president, Ben Reynolds, who told him that Silvergate neither holds FTT tokens nor lends against them, and that FTX’s challenges have had no direct impact on the company.“As for the suggestion expressed by some on social media that SI’s SEN Leverage platform could suffer losses due to exposure to FTX, [Reynolds] noted that all of the platform’s loans are significantly overcollateralized by bitcoin that could be liquidated to cover those exposures if necessary,” Palmer wrote in a research note. BTIG has a buy rating and $135 price target on Silvergate.Separately, Canaccord highlighted that Silvergate doesn’t hold any crypto assets of its own, and should be able to avoid additional risk from the FTX situation.“In the event that FTX ceases operations or some customers migrate to other exchanges, it is highly likely that Silvergate will still capture that trading volume under its operational umbrella,” Canaccord analyst Joe Vafi told clients in a note.

473,"Ethereum was founded on a vague, albeit tightly held set of principles around financial freedom and credible neutrality. Recently, those principles have been tested.As regulators and big-money players bid for a larger role in Ethereum’s “decentralized” ecosystem, the blockchain’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, shared an updated vision for the network on Saturday – augmenting a road map he shared last month to include a new development track focused on ameliorating the censorship of transactions and an exploitative bot-driven trading practice known as maximal extractable value (MEV).Censorship and MEV have become more existential for Ethereum in recent months, with governments and sophisticated users challenging key safeguards meant to ensure the network’s neutrality – the idea that anyone using or building on the network is treated without bias.This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.When the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) sanctioned addresses associated with the Ethereum-based Tornado Cash – effectively calling on the network’s operators to stop processing (i.e., start censoring) transactions linked with the program – it directly challenged the idea that blockchains like Ethereum, which are supposedly operated in a decentralized manner, cannot be tamed by central authorities.As for the scourge of MEV, the practice covers a mishmash of behavior but boils down to strategically ignoring, re-ordering or poaching transactions added to a blockchain – screwing over the person who originally placed a trade.By formalizing an approach to these problems in a standalone section of Ethereum’s road map, Buterin is seemingly reminding the crypto community that MEV problems and censorship risks should be addressable – at least in part – by routine updates to the blockchain’s code.Read more: What Is MEV, aka Maximal Extractable Value? - EthereumButerin’s road map is divided into six development “tracks” that are all progressing in parallel, each track containing a hodgepodge of proposed upgrades for the blockchain’s core code.Ethereum’s first track, “The Merge,” reached a key milestone in September when the network shifted to a proof-of-stake system, abandoning the significantly more energy-intensive proof-of-work system trailblazed by Bitcoin.Slotted between the speed-focused second track, “The Surge,” and the efficiency-focused fourth track, “The Verge” (which also saw significant revisions with the new road map) is a new track: “The Scourge.”The goal of the Scourge, according to Buterin’s new road map, is to “ensure reliable and credibly neutral transaction inclusion and avoid centralization and other protocol risks from MEV.”Since the U.S. Treasury Department sanctions against Tornado Cash were announced over the summer, more than 51% of the validators that write and approve transactions on the network have begun ignoring those associated with the program, which is used to obscure where crypto is being sent to and from.For many crypto developers and enthusiasts, that’s censorship, and so anathema to their goals.Tornado transactions can still make it onto Ethereum, but they do so at a delayed rate relative to typical transactions. If enough validators refuse to process Tornado Cash transactions for fear of upsetting regulators, those transactions could, in theory, be censored from the chain entirely.Also at risk of jeopardizing Ethereum’s neutrality is MEV – extra profit that validators operating the network can earn by re-ordering the transactions that they add to the network. The opportunity to extract MEV exists as a quirk of how blockchains like Ethereum operate, whereby the validators that run the network can effectively preview pending transactions from other users before they are finalized.Though MEV may add some baked-in incentives to Ethereum that help the network operate more efficiently, it can also harm users. For an example of how, look up “sandwich attacks,” whereby a validator profits off of advanced knowledge of a trade, ripping off other traders in doing so.Though censorship and MEV pose major challenges to Ethereum, Buterin and other core contributors to the network say that their harms can be programmed away.Included in the Scourge, one method for addressing censorship and MEV concerns is protocol-level proposer-builder separation (PBS).Today, Ethereum’s validators are responsible for compiling transactions into blocks (building), as well as pitching those blocks out to other validators so they can be accepted onto Ethereum’s ledger (proposing).PBS separates building and proposing into two distinct roles. As a result, validators should have less of an ability to directly censor or reorder transactions – both limiting the amount of exploitative MEV they can extract, and potentially reducing the ability (or necessity) for validators to censor transactions to comply with regulators.Though PBS is not baked into Ethereum’s code, it is already the network’s status quo. Most validators today use “MEV-Boost,” software that pre-builds MEV-optimized blocks for validators so they can easily earn more for their work.Flashbots, the research and development firm behind the software, apparently aims to make MEV extraction more equitable. It has been scrutinized, however, for contributing to Ethereum’s problem with centralization and censorship: anyone is allowed to build and deliver blocks through MEV-boost, but most validators opt to receive blocks pre-built by Flashbots itself, which censors out Tornado Cash transactions.Buterin, to prevent block builders from censoring in the future, includes a proposal for “inclusion lists” in the Scourge track on his road map. Once PBS is built into Ethereum, this proposal would give proposers the ability to effectively demand that builders include certain types of transactions in their blocks.Ethereum’s open-source developer community is famously slow to implement big updates, and the release of a new road map should be viewed as much as a PR play from Buterin as a practical set of next steps.Although Buterin’s updated road map includes myriad new additions outside of the new “Scourge” track, the introduction of an entirely new section focused on MEV and censorship shows how top-of-mind centralization has become for Ethereum in recent months. It shows that Buterin (and co.) are thinking deeply about some of the ecosystem’s most pressing headwinds – even as questions remain around whether regulations and community consensus may make them difficult to code away.",2022/11/09
474,"Crypto exchanges are now scrambling to publicly publish their fund reserves as insolvency fears grapple crypto investors following contagion risks stemming from liquidity issues at FTX.In the past 24 hours, nine exchanges – Binance, Gate.io, KuCoin, Poloniex, Bitget, Huobi, OKX, Deribit and Bybit– have separately issued statements that they would publish their Merkle tree reserve certificates to increase transparency.A Merkle tree is a data structure that is used in computer science applications. In bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies​, Merkle trees serve to encode blockchain data more efficiently and securely. They are also referred to as ""binary hash trees.""In a centralized crypto exchange, every user’s assets are recorded by the ledger of a centralized database. The recorded assets in the database are the total amount of the user’s assets.Using Merkle trees allows exchanges to store each user account’s hash value of assets in the “leaf nodes” of the Merkle tree. The second step is to audit those assets in the leaf node of the Merkle tree and verify all the users’ holdings by a third party.Crypto exchange Binance founder Changpeng Zhao urged industry players to provide “proof of reserves” following Tuesday’s events involving FTX and Binance.

475,"Total crypto market capitalization slid to $900 billion from over $1 trillion on Wednesday morning as traders reacted to speculations around prominent exchange FTX’s liquidity issues. Over $700 million in long positions, or bets for higher prices, was liquidated in the past 24 hours as traders were caught on the wrong footing.Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) each declined more than 8% in the past 24 hours to reach levels previously seen in October 2020, putting a gradual recovery on hold. Other crypto majors like XRP, dogecoin (DOGE) and cardano (ADA) slipped over 12%, while solana (SOL) – of which Sam Bankman-Fried is a prominent backer – dropped 25%.Futures tracking bitcoin and ether saw a cumulative $390 million loss due to liquidations, while SOL futures saw $40 million liquidated. FTT futures had a relatively lesser $27 million in liquidations – implying the steep drop was mostly driven by sales of spot tokens.Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position because of a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).FTX came under scrutiny following a CoinDesk report last week that found the balance sheet of Alameda Research, a crypto trading unit owned by Sam Bankman-Fried, who also owns FTX, was full of FTX’s native FTT tokens.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization last fell below $19,000 on Oct. 21. Ether was recently changing hands a little above $1,300, off more than 16% from Monday, same time. Other major altcoins sank by double digits to cap a turbulent day that saw crypto markets sink immediately following the Binance/FTX announcement, rise hopefully and then sink again as investors absorbed the rapid decline of one of the crypto industry's leading lights.A version of this article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.FTX’s FTT token was trading at just below $6, a 74% decline during the past 24 hours. Solana's SOL, which had tumbled Monday on speculation that Bankman-Fried's trading firm, Alameda Research, might have to dump some of its holdings in a bid to raise liquidity, was off nearly 22%. Binance’s BNB token outperformed the market, but was still down about 4%.The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, recently fell just 0.5% but was down over 10% at one point.“The FTT token will find it very hard if not impossible to recover while SOL and ecosystem tokens are likely to suffer losses too as trust appears to be eroded entirely,” wrote Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, in an email to CoinDesk, although he noted optimistically that “we don’t “expect bitcoin to face an extreme scenario. In fact, it could see increased inflows as market participants withdraw from riskier assets.”“Either way, the sooner this gets resolved the better it is for the space, especially as it is likely to draw more attention from regulators,” DiPasquale wrote.As U.S. voters went to the polls for midterm elections, stocks continued their momentum from Monday as the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose a few fractions of a percentage point, while the the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was up 1%. Safe haven gold also had another upbeat day, climbing 2.2%.In an email, Marieke Fament, CEO of the NEAR Foundation, called said that ""consolidation is inevitable in crypto's current bear market,” but also saw FTX’s problems and the proposed acquisition as a potential learning experience.“There's nowhere to hide during crypto winter – and developments such as the acquisition of FTX by Binance underscores the challenges and lack of transparency behind the scenes of some key players – which undermine the reputation of crypto,” Fament said. “Moving forward, the ecosystem is going to learn from these mistakes and hopefully create a stronger sector that puts honesty, transparency and consumer protection at the heart of their businesses.""Prediction Markets Split on Whether Binance Will Follow Through on FTX DealBy Sam ReynoldsFTX and Binance shocked the crypto market on Tuesday by announcing that the former would sell itself to the latter. Sam Bankman-Fried, once thought of as the ""Warren Buffet"" of crypto, is set to vanish from his throne.But will the deal go through? Right now it's only a non-binding letter of intent that is subject to Binance’s due diligence. The market, however, is giving it an almost even chance of failing.Investors on Polymarket think there’s a 45% chance that Binance will pull out of the FTX deal and a 55% chance the deal goes through. Granted, the volume is small at $573 so the sample size is not large.Polymarket ran similar contracts about the Elon Musk-Twitter takeover deal, asking if Musk would be the CEO of Twitter by Nov. 30. Given how much drama was involved in the deal, with Musk attempting to pull out of it, it looked like the “no” side was all but certain to win. Then things changed.Remember that Binance’s deal for FTX doesn’t include Alameda Research, the market maker and investment fund which kicked off this crisis. So maybe the exchange will sail through due diligence, or maybe there are a few more skeletons in the closet.9:30 a.m.HKT/SGT(1:30 UTC) China Consumer Price Index (YoY/Oct)Sharm El-Sheikh UN Climate Change Conference 2022 (Egypt)TOKEN2049 (London)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""Money Reimagined"" on CoinDesk TV:Blockchains, the Solution to Climate Change Concerns, From Nearcon 2022“Money Reimagined,” hosts Michael Casey and Sheila Warren were together again at Nearcon 2022.

479,"The U.S. votes for the House of Representatives and Senate on Tuesday, potentially setting the direction for the next two years of legislative and regulatory action.The crypto industry has tried to play a major role in the election through donations, though results have been tempered at best. Despite that, a number of candidates with strong views on crypto are on the ballot, and whether or not they’re elected – as well as which party ends up controlling the House and the Senate – could well determine what sort of legislative priorities receive attention next year.Despite their importance, the main story Tuesday was the surprise announcement by Sam Bankman-Fried, a major donor and the founder of trading firm FTX, and Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the founder of Binance, that the latter had signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire FTX.The news came days after CoinDesk first reported that much of FTX sister firm Alameda Research’s balance sheet was composed of FTX’s own exchange token FTT, raising questions and concerns that the company may not have been as well-collateralized as it purported to be.Prior to last week’s news, Bankman-Fried was a prominent face in Washington D.C, telling a banking conference last month that he spent much of his time talking to lawmakers and regulators. His influence may wane, given his company’s sudden decline, and legislative issues like the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, which he supported, may suddenly lose industry backing.ND (12:10 a.m. ET): While a number of results have rolled in, it still seems to be far too early to tell whether Democrats retain control of both houses of Congress or if Republicans will take control of one or both bodies. As of midnight ET, the New York Times rated the Senate a tossup, and the House leaning Republican.The crypto markets remained focused on the FTX/Alameda collapse, with few in the crypto industry focusing on midterms Tuesday. The market meltdown appears to have halted, at least for the moment. The price of major cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ether, BNB and XRP remained relatively steady over the past hour, in sharp contrast to downturns earlier in the day, according to CoinGecko.The outlook for the crypto industry remains up in the air. A number of pro-crypto lawmakers have won their races, from both sides of the aisle. Many of the driving forces behind legislation that could move in the coming year have maintained their seats, and lawmakers from both parties seemed confident that legislation would move forward regardless of the political makeup of Congress.The confounding factors might be the market itself. Bankman-Fried and FTX’s collapse will likely have a negative impact on how crypto is perceived in Washington. Indeed, two longtime supporters of crypto, Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry and Senator Cynthia Lummis, both argued that the collapse is a sign that the industry needs clearer regulation.JH (11:38 p.m. ET): The son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson – Jonathan Jackson – is one of the few congressional candidates in this election to have openly advocated for cryptocurrency during his campaign. The Democrat was easily winning his Chicago district with 79% of the vote, so the crypto industry’s political-action committees can chalk up a victory there, having spent considerably to support his primary. In fact, they spent so much that Jackson had to issue a statement that said the crypto dollars were technically “independent expenditures” under campaign finance rules and therefore out of his hands.ND (11:31 p.m. ET): New York Governor Kathy Hochul won reelection Tuesday night. Hochul has sat on a bill to prohibit new carbon-based crypto mining facilities for two years, which the state legislature passed earlier this year. She told reporters on numerous occasions that she was still reviewing the bill, but she hasn't expressed many other views on crypto.JH (11:31 p.m. ET): Republican Markwayne Mullin, also a recipient of crypto largesse, was projected to win a full term in the Senate from Oklahoma with 62% of the vote. He won a primary to fill the seat earlier this year.JH (11:22 p.m. ET): Democratic Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Richie Torres (D-N.Y.), members of the congressional blockchain caucus, were holding onto their seats with about 58% and more than 82% of the votes, respectively. Several other House candidates supported by the cryptocurrency industry also headed toward the winners’ circle Tuesday night, including Glenn Ivey, a Democrat who crushed his opponent in Maryland, and Republican Mark Alford, who sailed to a commanding victory in Missouri. And Missouri’s attorney general, Eric Schmitt, will be the next senator there, having been backed by one of the main industry PACs.The industry may recall New York Democratic incumbent Rep. Nydia Velazquez, who held a hearing on blockchain technology and small businesses in 2020 (which didn’t seem to produce any particular congressional action). She’s winning re-election, so she’ll be expected to return to the House Financial Services Committee.CL (10:40 p.m. ET) Republican J.D. Vance has an 8-point lead over his Democratic competitor, Tim Ryan, in the battle for retired Ohio Senator Rob Portman’s open seat. The New York Times is reporting Vance is “very likely” to win, with 82% of the votes in. Both Vance and Ryan have been vocal about their support for the cryptocurrency industry. The outgoing Portman was a key author of the bipartisan infrastructure law which contained a crypto tax provision the industry lobbied unsuccessfully to defeat.ND (10:35 p.m. ET): Rep. Warren Davidson, a leading pro-crypto Republican, won reelection to the House of Representatives. Davidson was the author of the Token Taxonomy Act, an effort to create some legislative clarity around how cryptocurrencies could be regulated in the U.S.ND (10:20 p.m. ET): The crypto markets have remained relatively steady over the past hour or so, a bit of a contrast from the rest of the day. Bitcoin’s price traded around $18,000, while ether traded around $1,300, down only 1 or 2% over the past hour, according to CoinGecko. While prices have been relatively calm since polls began closing, they’re still down heavily – at least 10% or more for some major cryptocurrencies – over the past day.Markets were shocked early on Tuesday after Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao announced Binance could acquire FTX under a non-binding letter of intent. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, and neither was a timeline for when the deal might close.Prediction markets are unsure whether the deal will actually close, giving CZ the same odds of closing as they are of the deal falling through.CL (10:09 p.m. ET) The New York Times is predicting that former Republican Congressman Ted Budd will win the senate seat in North Carolina, beating his Democratic competitor, Cheri Beasley. 84% of votes are currently in, and Budd holds a three-point lead over Beasley. As a congressman, Budd was on the Congressional Blockchain Caucus and led the charge on several crypto-friendly policy initiatives.ND (10:05 p.m. ET): Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, won reelection. Polis founded the Congressional Blockchain Caucus as a lawmaker in the House of Representatives, and has remained crypto-friendly during his terms as governor.ND (9:55 p.m. ET): Rep. Patrick McHenry, the senior-most Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, won another term Tuesday night. The Congressman, who was one of the driving forces behind a highly-anticipated bill regulating stablecoins, is poised to take over the Financial Services Committee if Republicans take the House of Representatives.JH (9:55 p.m. ET): Texas Democrat Jasmine Crockett, who was supported by an influx of crypto industry money during her primary race, was on track to easily win her seat. She represented a strategy the industry leaned on in its campaign giving this year, to focus on primaries in districts with dominant party majorities, taking the stress off their candidates’ need for support during the general election. Crockett had more than 76% of the vote at the halfway point.CL (9:37 p.m. ET): Incumbent Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, looks primed to beat his Democratic opponent Beto O’Rourke. Though only 44% of votes are in, some outlets including Fox have already called the race in Abbott’s favor. Abbott has been a strong supporter of the crypto industry in Texas, where miners have flocked to take advantage of the state’s cheap electricity.JH (9:33 p.m. ET): Some of the earliest East Coast states to close their polls started to hint at what all those talking heads have been talking about: The Republicans may find the momentum to seize the House.The early results in district's like Virginia's 2nd and 7th were widely seen as bellwethers, and they both showed strong Republican numbers, though the final tallies are far from over. But other close battles, such as in Indiana’s 1st and Ohio's 1st, are so far seeing a strong start in the Democrats’ favor.If the Republicans do win this majority, it means a new speaker of the House, of course, and also new committee chairmen – including for the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee. The former oversees the banking regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The latter oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. These are the panels where a lot of the most important work is going to be done on bills that one day regulate cryptocurrencies in the U.S.Fortunately for the crypto industry, digital assets oversight isn't yet one of those categories that sends Democrats and Republicans into their trenches. Even with the bullets flying next year, lawmakers may still find a path through this neutral territory to make crypto legislation happen.ND (9:07 p.m. ET) The Associated Press projects that Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.) won another term representing his district in the House of Representatives. Soto has long been a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, and reintroduced the Token Taxonomy Act alongside Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) last year.ND (9:00 p.m. ET): The Associated Press and CNN are predicting that Katie Britt has won a Senate seat, representing Alabama (with 1% of precincts reporting in at press time). The Republican will succeed Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), who famously blocked unanimous consent against an amendment to last year’s bipartisan infrastructure bill which would have modified a crypto tax provision.Britt said she supports crypto, accepting bitcoin, ethereum and dogecoin for campaign donations and announcing her “staunch support” for the crypto ecosystem.JH (8:47 p.m. ET): Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) is showing early hope for defending his young seat against his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker. This is one of the handful of U.S. Senate seats that can tip the 50-50 balance in that chamber, where Democrats have enjoyed their tie-breaking advantage.Warnock had more than 50% of the vote with about 44% of the count complete, with Walker at 48%.The Georgia incumbent is a member of both the Senate Banking Committee and the Agriculture Committee, which will probably be the two most important committees when it comes to the future of crypto regulations. However, Warnock hasn't yet been a major voice in digital-assets issues. He did sign on to a bill to make it harder for Russia to undermine sanctions by using cryptocurrencies.CORRECTION (Nov. 9, 2022, 04:56 UTC): Corrects that Markwayne Mullin won a primary runoff election to compete in the Senate race earlier this year.",2022/11/09
480,"Speculation surrounding Sam Bankman Fried’s crypto exchange FTX grew so intense that the firm agreed to sell itself to bigger rival Binance. Blockchain data offers a fresh perspective on FTX’s liquidity crunch, illustrating how the drama escalated so quickly.Comprehending why Binance agreed to buy FTX today means understanding FTX’s liquidity woes.One of the earliest red flags came from the top 10 addresses by withdrawal volume on FTX. These addresses, which include Nexo, Circle and Jump Trading, have withdrawn a whopping $1.87 billion in the past seven days, Nansen data suggests.Nexo, a crypto lending platform that has more than five million users worldwide, as stated on the company’s homepage, has withdrawn more than $408 million worth of ether (ETH) from FTX. The blockchain explorer website Etherscan confirms Nansen’s data, with Nexo transferring ETH in large volumes through several transactions. Here are several Nexo transactions out of FTX with values of at least 4,999 ETH: Tx1, Tx2, Tx3, Tx4, Tx5, Tx6, Tx7, Tx8 and Tx9.Market participants also have withdrawn $121 million USDC from FTX to Circle’s deposit contract address, data from Nansen and Etherscan suggests. (Nansen shows that $1.15 billion USDC has left Coinbase in the past 24 hours, reflecting of users taking tokens off exchanges.)Data from Coinglass reveals that in the past 24 hours, the number of bitcoins on FTX dropped by 19,941.64 BTC to 36.14 as of press time.Understanding the volatility stemming from the FTX drama continues with stablecoin outflows. According to Nansen data, in the past seven days starting on Monday, Nov. 7, FTX led all exchanges in stablecoin outflows. Some $451 million worth of stablecoins have left FTX, more than the combined outflows of KuCoin, Crypto.com and OKX.Specifically, FTX’s holdings of USDC and USDT have nosedived dramatically. Between Friday, Nov. 4 and Tuesday, Nov. 8, Nansen data states that FTX’s USDC holdings dropped about $137 million, roughly 84%, while its USDT holdings dropped from $198 million to $68 million.According to CryptoQuant, FTX’s stablecoin reserve stands at roughly $156 million currently, down more than 78% since Oct. 24.FTX’s stablecoin reserve is at its lowest levels in a year. Some market participants have been concerned because one of the initial signs that foreshadowed the collapse of Terra Luna was when UST deposits on the Anchor lending protocol started dropping rapidly.While the chart shows a large outflow of stablecoins from KuCoin, KuCoin’s net stablecoin change is actually zero. On Nov. 5, Kucoin conducted a simple swap of USDT between the Ethereum and Tron network. 300 million ERC-20 USDT left KuCoin, and 300 million TRC-20 USDT entered into KuCoin. The swap was “because of users’ demand” and was “not a decision related to FTX,” wrote KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu to CoinDesk via Twitter.Nansen data only shows Ethereum-based stablecoins currently, excluding ones on the Tron network. According to data from CoinMetrics, 34.1 billion USDT is supplied on the Tron network, 1.8 billion more than the USDT supplied on Ethereum.Additionally, prolific and active cryptocurrency traders have been transferring their wealth out of FTX, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen. Over the last 24 hours, the top 10 withdrawal wallets categorized by Nansen as belonging to “smart money” have removed about $246.6 million worth of tokens.Nansen considers a wallet to be “smart money” if it meets at least one of several test, including:Jump Trading, which focuses on ecosystem building, quant research and trading, has withdrawn $118 million, more than the next six addresses combined.Other notable smart money withdrawals include asset management firm Arca and SBF’s trading firm Alameda Research. Alameda Research transferred 92 million BIT (roughly $35 million) out of FTX and into their own address.The chart above shows the daily price and volume of the FTX exchange’s FTT token, which grants holders a discount on trading fees on the FTX marketplace. Following CoinDesk’s disclosure on Nov. 2, FTT recently slid roughly 79%, with its volume jumping dramatically.The data in the chart only covers volume on the FTX exchange, so it may not cover the entire FTT trading volume across all exchanges. The chart shows that the recent revelations triggered a flurry of interest in the token and that the drop in FTT was accompanied by significant price discovery.UPDATE (Nov. 9, 17:07:07 UTC): Updated with information in the second chart section about stablecoin outflow by clarifying KuCoin's net stablecoin change, added quotes from KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu elucidating Nansen's capabilities, including a statistic from CoinMetrics, and adding more context to the actual chart.",2022/11/09

The stock's lower by another 2.2% in after hours action.In addition to the miss, Marathon trimmed its year-end 2022 computing power, or hashrate expectations from previous guidance of 11.5 exahash/second (EH/s) to 9 EH/s. The company, however, reiterated its goal to have 23 EH/s of computing power running mid-2023. Hashrate as of Nov. 1 was 7 EH/s.CEO Fred Thiel called the quarter a transitionary period as his company exited a site in Hardin, Montana, and began energizing operations in Texas.The lowering of year-end hashrate guidance isn't totally unexpected as doubts had previously emerged about Marathon’s ability to deliver on that prediction, with Jefferies in a note on Monday saying the company faced downside risks on its growth targets.The first risk, said Jefferies, is Marathon's expectation of 3.2 EH/s to be plugged into a Compute North facility in Texas. In addition to regulatory delays, there's the issue of Compute North's bankruptcy, and whether Marathon might have to renegotiate terms with the hosting company. The other risk, said the bank, is 12.2 EH/s expected from Applied Blockchain (APLD) facilities in North Dakota and Texas, which are also facing regulatory delays.Speaking on the earnings call, Thiel said Marathon expects a positive answer soon from Texas regulators regarding Compute North's site.

Did an exchange the size of FTX really have to sell?As recently as Monday, CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was assuring his 860,000 Twitter followers that “all assets” were fine. Hours earlier, Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison was offering to buy Binance’s supply of FTX’s FTT tokens. The reversal of fortunes was mind numbingly fast. But balance sheet problems – an overabundance of FTT – with Alameda Research, the trading firm that is part of Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire, exposed FTX to liquidity problems that prompted the sudden sale. Too much of FTX’s net equity consisted of its own FTT token, raising concerns among some crypto observers as CoinDesk reported.2. What happens to crypto asset prices?FTX’s problems stem from the all-too-familiar cocktail of leverage and liquidity, particularly when there’s too much of one and not enough of the other.FTX’s “Earn” program offered users the ability to earn as much as 8% on deposits of bitcoin, ether and other assets.The spread between “earn” and prevailing risk-free rates imply the use of leverage and risk to create surplus yield. But this combination can become increasingly problematic if an entity must meet increases in user withdrawals. That appears to be exactly what FTX was facing.BTC balances on FTX have declined from 20,000 on Nov. 2 to a single bitcoin today.Should crypto investors be wary or hopeful? The individual or entity who speaks with the most confidence on price direction likely deserves the highest level of skepticism.Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) prices have been whipsawing on Tuesday – crypto markets at their best or worst, depending on your perspective. Following the announcement, BTC and ETH rose 4.33% and 5.7% respectively, only to decline 5% and 6.43% in the following hour. Recently, BTC and ETH were down 8% and 12%Both moves came with higher-than-average volume implying that bulls and bears have conviction. Technical indicators are changing by the hour, so prudent investors will wait patiently without reading too much into any of them.But these investors will also be closely tracking BTC and ETH to see if their prices fall below $18,100 and $1,300 respectively, thresholds when trading volume for those assets has historically declined.3. Will Alameda be forced to liquidate assets?While Binance has acquired FTX, it appears that Alameda will remain a separate entity. Alameda’s apparent insolvency issues may force the company to liquidate part of its holdings, placing downward pressure on specific assets that will then ripple through the wider crypto market. BTC and ETH could potentially be impacted, but other assets such as SOL, and SRM could reportedly come under pressure as well.4. Will Binance follow through?Maybe this should have been the first question. Firms have been known to back out of deals. Elon Musk most recently tried to walk away from his purchase of the social media platform Twitter before he said yes again, albeit under legal duress. His massive job cuts and questionable early steps as Twitter owner suggest he might be regretting his commitment and the debt with which he must now wrestle.Certainly Binance is under no obligation to consummate the acquisition if it finds issues with FTX that make senior management uncomfortable. The due diligence in the coming weeks will reveal more.5. Will regulators allow the deal to close?Questions have already arisen, regarding whether the deal would violate anti-trust laws. Regulators worldwide have the power to block major mergers if they fear they would limit market choice, and also have strict laws against anti-competitive behavior. Binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, while FTX is within the top five, according to data site CoinGecko.Stay tuned.",2022/11/08
484,"Bitcoin miners across the U.S. are looking to Tuesday's midterm elections for a signal on the future of environmental policy, which may impact their expansions and operations.Since President Joe Biden took office almost two years ago, bitcoin mining has garnered attention in the U.S. political landscape, as miners moved their operations en masse from China and new investments were made domestically.The midterms are crucial for policy because they could “set the tone for how the industry is perceived at both the state and federal level as they weigh approaches to the industry,” said Kyle Schneps, director of public policy at digital asset mining and staking infrastructure firm Foundry, which is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company Digital Currency Group.As more miners expanded in the U.S., Democratic lawmakers led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have questioned the industry’s large energy usage and impact on electricity grids throughout the country. Bitcoin mining consumes great amounts of electricity to secure the blockchain’s network as specialized computers try to guess the answer to an equation, which environmentalists think is working against U.S. and global climate goals.However, the Republicans have been a supporter of bitcoin mining and crypto in general. “Although the mining industry has tried to promote a bipartisan approach to lobbying, support has mostly come from right wing or center politicians,” said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at mining services firm Luxor Technologies. “Republicans are less likely to push the more stringent direction proposed in White House paper released in early September,” Vera said.The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy called for standards to reduce the industry’s impact on the environment in a September report.Crypto broadly and mining in particular “has managed to stay largely bipartisan at the federal level,” said Foundry's Schneps. The biggest difference is not along party lines but adoption, meaning “younger and more diverse political leaders are embracing the industry,” he said.But John Olsen, New York policy lead at industry lobbying group Blockchain Association, thinks the issue “has too often developed into the hyper partisanship we’ve all experienced in other areas of political life.”Amid this debate, the key states investors will be watching in the upcoming midterm elections are New York and Texas.In July, New York state passed legislation, sponsored by Democrat Anna Kelles, that prohibits the development of new mining facilities using carbon-based energy for two years as authorities study its impact on the environment on local communities and the environment.The legislation, which has not yet been signed into law, has nevertheless pushed companies and jobs out of the state, Schneps said.“Upcoming elections could show a public rebuke of this type of anti-jobs policy during a time of economic hardship,” Schneps said. The economic impact of the moratorium was a sticking point for Democrats Clyde Vanel and Jeremy Cooney, who opposed the bill.Meanwhile in Texas, arguably the world’s latest bitcoin mining hub with 1.5 gigawatts (GW) of mining projects, politicians are working with industry group Texas Blockchain Council (TBC) to introduce legislation “to support the continued development of the bitcoin mining industry in Texas,” said Steve Kinnard, the council’s director of Bitcoin Mining Analytics.The TBC has identified eight candidates from both parties who “have demonstrated support for the blockchain, bitcoin and digital asset industry through in-depth technical knowledge of the space or willingness to engage on key policy issues,” Kinnard said. The list includes Governor Gregg Abbott.The council has endorsed some of these candidates, Kinnard said, adding that the midterms are important because they will “set priorities and key stakeholders for the upcoming legislative session.""",2022/11/08
485,"The FTX's exchange token, FTT, went into free fall Tuesday even after the company got a lifeline from larger rival Binance, as fears mounted over the crypto trading firm Alameda Research's financial woes, fueling what appeared to be contagion driving down prices broadly across digital asset markets.Both Alameda and FTX are part of the billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried's now-fast-dwindling crypto empire.FTT fell to $4, down more than 80% over the past 24 hours. SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, fell to $21 from $30. At press time, FTT trades at $5.56 and SOL changes hands at $23.90.Broader crypto markets, which mounted a short-lived recovery after the bailout announcement, quickly lost steam and turned sharply lower. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which tracks 162 cryptocurrencies, fell 8% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, tumbled to $17,114 on the Bitstamp exchange, a 23-month low. The BTC price recovered somewhat to $18,400 but was still down 12% on the day.Among the 500 digital assets in CoinDesk's Digital Asset Classification Standard, some 95% were lower over the past 24 hours.CoinDesk reported last week that Alameda Research's balance sheet is loaded with highly illiquid FTT tokens, and is also a big holder of SOL tokens. Some of these tokens were put up as collateral to take out loans. As of June 30, Alameda held $3.66 billion of “unlocked FTT” tokens and $2.16 billion of FTT as collateral, while its SOL holdings totaled to about $1.2 billion, according to the documents reviewed by CoinDesk.Investors fear that the giant Binance exchange's bailout of FTX might not extend to Alameda, which is a significant market maker and lender in the crypto space, and that Alameda might face margin calls and be forced to fire-sell assets from its balance sheet to raise liquidity.""There’s a lot more pain to go around as Alameda will be heavily affected by the crash of FTT,"" Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at Storm Partners, told CoinDesk. ""A multi-billion dollar loss will hurt.”Alameda's rout could spell trouble for the broader crypto industry, including lenders exposed to the trading firm and to crypto ecosystems which Alameda and FTX have been heavily invested.""Assuming Alameda doesn’t survive, there could be a good deal of pain, particularly for the Solana ecosystem – in which they were deeply involved – and any institutions that had lent to Alameda,"" Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko.To illustrate just how spectacular the FTT token price's collapse has been, take a look at the following chart of the 10 biggest laggards over the past 24 hours in the ""Transparent CeFi Currency"" industry group, within the CoinDesk DACS. The industry group includes digital assets ""distributed by a central entity and backed by a centralized reserve treasury (i.e., corporation, government, CBDC’s, centralized exchange),"" according to the definition.",2022/11/08

Coinbase further said it has no exposure to FTX's token FTT – which has plunged about 80% Tuesday – and no exposure to FTX sister company Alameda Research.The exchange did have some technical issues Tuesday, acknowledging network connection problems for both web and mobile. It's unclear at this time if those outages have been fixed.Meanwhile, another crypto exchange, Kraken, is also distanced itself from FTX. ""Kraken has no material exposure to FTX or Alameda. We do not support FTT on either our spot or derivative platforms,"" Kraken's spokesperson, Edith Camargo, told CoinDesk.Coinbase shares are down about 9% as bitcoin (BTC) plunged below $17,000, to a new 23-month low on Wednesday.UPDATE (Nov. 9, 17:30 UTC): Adds comments from Kraken.

487,"We may never know how close Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) crypto empire came to collapse, or the collateral damage that would have caused for the industry, but we do know the principal risks at play. And sadly, it’s the same issues Bitcoin was created over a decade ago to solve: financial self-dealing, human hubris and untransparent markets.What just happened: Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, has agreed to buy a competitor it had initially nurtured and then almost tanked, FTX. Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao confirmed the deal on Twitter, saying the two exchanges signed a non-binding letter of intent.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.The deal, still subject to due diligence processes and not completed, is a stopgap measure to save SBF’s crypto exchange from insolvency. It will likely calm markets that had been rocked by a public rift between two crypto titans so well known as to go simply by their initials.This is a meteoric fall for SBF – the once-beloved poster boy of crypto who plastered his exchange’s name across stadiums and posed for glossy magazine spreads – who just months ago was touted as the “J.P. Morgan” of crypto for his efforts in backstopping bankrupt blockchain businesses like BlockFi.""Things have come full circle, and FTX.com’s first, and last, investors are the same: we have come to an agreement on a strategic transaction with Binance for FTX.com (pending DD etc.),"" Bankman-Fried tweeted Tuesday, using shorthand for “due diligence.”Keeping with the full circle motif, it’s worth noting SBF always saw blockchain more as a means to an end. He entered crypto after a few years as a Jane Street quant, with the stated aim of making as much money to gain as much influence as possible. That would be a fine mentality in crypto had SBF any apparent love of the tools and protocols that made him rich.Instead, SBF, a political mega-donor who has spent $50 million during the past U.S. election cycle, has used his influence to push for regulations that ruffled his customers and competitors’ feathers. He was a vocal proponent of the DCCPA bill that would create a brokerage-like licensing system for decentralized finance and argued against financial privacy.That’s what he said in public. For CZ, the bigger concern was what was said behind closed doors, “[W]e won’t support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs,” the Binance CEO tweeted this weekend. This was CZ’s attempt at being “transparent,” he said, explaining a large transaction of over $500 million FTT tokens to Binance made the day before.He announced Binance would be selling these tokens into the open market, and drew a worrying comparison to LUNA, another project Binance was early to back that later collapsed after a bank run. CZ was seizing the moment caused by market uncertainty, after Alameda Research’s financials were leaked to CoinDesk.The links between FTX and its sister firm, the hedge fund Alameda, have historically been unclear beyond that both were founded by SBF. The leaked financial statement showed that the majority of Alameda’s assets were illiquid or locked altcoins – many of which SBF had a stake in including FTT, SOL and SRM (the token from the Serum decentralized exchange Bankman-Fried co-founded).Read more: Solana Falls and Speculation Centers on Links to Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX, Alameda“Alameda will never be able to cash in a significant portion of FTT to pay back its debts,” Mike Burgersburg, an independent market analyst for Dirty Bubble Media, which was early to call the collapse of Terra/LUNA, said.Bank runs can be self-fulling prophecies. Although several analysts said it was unlikely that either FTX or Alameda would suffer a margin call, investors began pulling funds, concerned their capital would be locked up in bankruptcy proceedings like with neobanks Celsius Network and Voyager Digital.Bankman-Fried and Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison did what they could to calm investors’ nerves, offering to mitigate a steep selloff of FTT by offering CZ $22 per token. Ellison said the leaked financial document did not account for another $10 billion Alameda allegedly had, while SBF said that client funds were “safe” and never rehypothecated into other crypto deals.On-chain analytics showed a more worrying story. Stablecoins and other assets were draining from FTX. Before the Binance buyout was announced today, traders had pulled all the bitcoin FTX had off the platform, according to Coinglass. Alameda was unlocking funds from various DeFi platforms to send ETH to FTX, seemingly unconcerned with steep withdrawal fees.FTX users began tweeting about delays in moving funds from the platform, while BitDAO asked Alameda to prove that it still held the 100 million BIT tokens the trading firm acquired last November, and began to vote whether to offload the 3.36 million FTT tokens BitDAO earned in that deal.Throughout this process, industry commentators chided SBF for the exchange’s lack of transparency and called for him to show proof of reserves for both FTX and Alameda. “It’s not much to ask, critics note, given SBF’s recent grandstanding about the need for more regulation and better governance in crypto,” Fortune’s Jeff John Roberts wrote.Yesterday, it became clear that Binance would reject SBF’s offers to sell its FTT tokens over-the-counter to minimize the sell-off. Instead, it would hold these assets – the fruit of what CZ called a “divorce” – like a Sword of Damocles. Bellwether cryptos like BTC and ETH, trading sideways yesterday, began to slip in overnight trading.It was clear the contagion would be severe if SBF’s empire fell. Crypto is tied-up in intricate knots, and once it frays the whole ecosystem can unravel – like after the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. A stablecoin called magic internet money (MIM), capitalized primarily with FTT, lost its peg to the dollar.See also: Binance CEO Zhao Considering Buying Banks: ReportAt least with open financial systems like MIM investors knew at what price they would be liquidated. FTX is a blackbox, and people only have the information SBF chose to reveal. Many began to read Bankman-Fried’s retweets of unconfirmed airdrops for FTX users that kept their capital on the exchange as signs of desperation.“[R]egardless of how it ends, it’s another blow against the industry (and financial institutions in general) simply for a lack of voluntary transparency, but it’s another giant check mark for the transparency of blockchain data and the skilled researchers trained to uncover, read and interpret this data,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund Arca, said.And so, we’re back at the beginning. It should come as no relief that SBF and CZ were apparently able to come to terms. It’s just another backroom deal.",2022/11/08

489,"Despite the recent crash in cryptocurrency markets, the technology behind stablecoins – a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold – will continue to play an important part in the evolution of the monetary system, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Thursday.The technologies, tokenization of securities and assets, smart contracts and cryptography, will “transform the future of financial systems,” the report said.As with any new development, “the challenge is to find the right balance between fostering innovation and maintaining financial stability and protection for consumers and investors,” JPMorgan said. The roles of the public and private sector still need to be clearly defined, according to the note.Policymakers will need to address financial stability risks by improving investor and consumer protection, and by enhancing know-your-customer (KYC) and “identity issue regulation” to stop money laundering and terrorist financing.“A blue sky regulatory framework is hard to achieve in light of political and technological realities,” the note said. The recent crypto market crash highlights the risks originating from such regulatory shortcomings, it added.An investor survey conducted by the bank showed that 28% of respondents said crypto would be the worst-performing asset class in 2023, and that 74% expected the bitcoin (BTC) price to be below $25,000 in six months.

493,"As U.S. voters head to the polls Tuesday, the crypto industry is confident that it’s positioned itself well for the newly divided government expected to emerge when the votes are tallied.Legislation that could finally establish U.S. oversight of digital assets is already bipartisan, and the industry’s funding of political campaigns has supported a number of well-placed Republicans.“Split control of the federal government could bode well for future crypto policy and regulation,” said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association in Washington. “In the current Congress, there is growing bipartisan collaboration on major legislation, and we would expect that trend to continue, and likely accelerate, if control changes hands.”However, while Republicans are more likely to emphasize a need for the U.S. to allow for crypto innovation and are less rigid about financial rules, taking over Congress doesn’t have an immediate impact on how cryptocurrencies will fare in future regulations. The heads of U.S. regulatory agencies remain Democratic appointees, and lawmakers still have a Democratic gatekeeper in President Joe Biden, who needs to sign off on any new laws.“For the next couple of years, anything that goes through Congress will have to get the president's signature,” said Ian Katz, a managing director at Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington, D.C.-based research firm. “So while Republicans may provide a generally more sympathetic audience for crypto, that doesn't mean party time for crypto if the Republicans get control of Congress.”If these midterm elections see a red wave of incoming Republicans, the major visible switch would be in the leadership of the chambers and the committees. The majority party tends to control the agenda for what issues come up and how. And when the administration is led by one party and Congress by another, it typically ignites an open warfare of committee hearings that relentlessly pummel the executive branch.Crypto observers who have already stoked a dislike for Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, for instance, will likely be watching him targeted by Republican lawmakers eager to shred his agency’s performance.“In a split government, the checks and balances intended by our founding fathers are really in play, and you often see congressional committee chairs try to exert their influence and authority over regulatory agencies and regulated industries,” said Keith Noreika, an executive vice president at Patomak Global Partners who ran the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for a time.A number of bills have been winding their way through Congress this year, but two are farther along than the others: an effort to oversee stablecoins and legislation that would empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to regulate the trading of certain tokens including bitcoin. Both are immersed in bipartisan negotiations, and they’re expected to provide the foundations of similar efforts in the new Congress next year.Read More: Here’s What Crypto Traders Expect From the MidtermsIf Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) moves from ranking Republican on the House Financial Services Committee to become its chairman, he could pick right back up where he left off on stablecoin oversight this year. He said the committee leaders have already agreed on much of the bill.The CFTC legislation is primarily an effort in the Senate Agriculture Committee – a product of common ground between Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and top Republican Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.) Though it doesn’t settle some of the uncertainties over which tokens should be regulated as commodities and which as securities, the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA) has drawn some industry support, including from FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. However, the industry has also been wary of how it might affect decentralized finance (DeFi), so negotiations have continued.The current Democrat-dominated government already provided cryptocurrency lobbyists some practice for navigating a partisan divide, because it was – for practical purposes – a majority in name only. The Democrat’s control of the Senate was so tenuous that legislation usually needed bipartisan support.If Republicans McHenry and Boozman end up taking over their committees, crypto industry campaign donations have benefited both of them this year. Crypto political action committees (PACs) have given tens of millions to candidates from both parties. For several incoming freshman lawmakers, industry support will have been key to their victories.In the House, the GOP is expected to increase its number of seats well over the 218 that would secure a majority. Republicans only need to win a handful of the many congressional races up for grabs, and most analysts have been predicting a majority well over 220. One estimate from BTIG this week puts the likely gain at 22.In the Senate, Republicans need only shift one seat to their side, and polling has indicated they may have a slight advantage to get that, according to the latest analysis at fivethirtyeight.com. The question is expected to be answered by the races in Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania.Another tight race is Arizona’s contest between Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and Republican challenger Blake Masters, one of the crypto industry’s greatest supporters in the midterms. So far, polling has suggested Kelly will win by a very narrow margin.",2022/11/08
494,"Crypto market leaders bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) shed their relative calm and faced selling pressure early Tuesday as FTT, the native token of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, nosedived to 21-month lows on lingering concerns regarding trading firm Alameda's balance sheet.At 04:30 UTC, bitcoin traded 4.3% lower on the day at $19,700, while ether changed hands at $1,480, representing a 5.5% decline, CoinDesk data show. FTX's FTT token tanked 20% to $17, the lowest since February 2021, extending the past week's 13% slide.Options data showed renewed demand for bearish put options tied to bitcoin and ether. The bearish shift in sentiment perhaps reflects investor fears that the ongoing FTX-Alameda drama may lead to Terra-like crypto collapse.""We have seen renewed demand for downside protection after the the negative news flow related to FTT,"" Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at over-the-counter crypto derivatives tech platform Paradigm, told CoinDesk.""Short dated skew in particular has moved in favor of puts as we have seen downside protection in both BTC and ETH with strong demand for end November/December expiries,"" Chu added.A call option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put option gives the right to sell. Options skew measures prices for bullish calls relative to bearish puts.The controversy surrounding Alameda's balance sheet began last week after CoinDesk reported that the trading firm holds large amounts locked or illiquid FTX tokens, painting the two entities unusually close to each other. (Alameda and FTX are sibling companies).Since then, FTT has crashed by 40% and the exchange has seen large withdrawals at an alarming rate.""Much of the anxiety comes from FTX’s app (formerly Blockfolio), which has a generous 'earn program' of about ~5% up to $100K. As expected, a lot of capital is being withdrawn, which some observers try to frame as a 'bank run'. So far, I have no indication that investors are having trouble withdrawing cash,"" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at London-based Marex Solutions, said in an email.""Moreover, a 5% rate (not far from U.S. rates) is not as egregious as what Anchor [a crypto lending protocol] or Celsius [Network] were doing. But we don’t have any visibility on the repurposing of funds or liquidity mismatches (which doesn’t mean they don’t exist),"" Solot added.Both short-term and long-term bitcoin call-put skews have turned lower from zero this week. The one-week skew has dropped from -1% to -12%, the lowest since late September, according to digital assets data provider Amberdata.In other words, puts are back in demand.A similar pattern is observed in ether call-put skews.The one-week ether call-put skew has dropped to nearly -20%, indicating strongest bias for bearish puts since mid-September.Options traders' expectations for price turbulence over the coming week and month have increased. Ether's seven-day implied volatility, or expectations for price volatility, jumped to an annualized 98%, the highest in two months. The one-month gauge ticked higher to a two-week high of 84%.""The market seems to be panicking, given the fact that LUNA event wasn't that long ago,"" Martin Cheung, an options trader from Pulsar, said, referring the uptick in the implied volatility.Terra's stablecoin UST and native token LUNA crashed in May, destroying billions of dollars in investor wealth. The crash brought down several lenders, including Celsius.According to Solot, FTX and Alameda's issues are unlikely to crash the market.""FTX is a systemically important player in the crypto ecosystem, so any trouble or loss of confidence – even if temporary – will have an outsized impact,"" Solot said.""That said, there’s a lot less leverage in the system right now, so there’s a greater chance any trouble can be contained more easily – or at least that losses will be concentrated instead of widespread.

495,"Fears over a withdrawal run from the billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX cryptocurrency exchange sent digital-asset markets into a fresh tailspin on Tuesday, hitting altcoins including the trading venue's own FTT as well as the Solana blockchain's SOL.In a departure from the stability witnessed earlier in the week, the tremors appeared to spread to bigger cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC), down 4.6% in the past 24 hours, and ether (ETH), down 6.3% – on a day when U.S. stocks were trading higher. In crypto options markets, traders were putting on fresh transactions to protect themselves from further downside. The 162-member CoinDesk Market Index lost 5.2%.The meltdown sparked eery recollections of the crypto market's dizzying crash earlier this year, which was punctuated by the failures of the Terra blockchain's UST stablecoin, the crypto lender Celsius Network, trading venue Voyager Digital and the investment fund Three Arrows Capital.The fresh drama was magnified by Bankman-Fried's reputation as one of the most powerful and hitherto successful industry figures, and came just days after none other than Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, CEO of the rival Binance exchange, said he planned to dump its remaining holdings of the FTT tokens.As of press time the FTT was down nearly 14% over the past 24 hours and 44% over the past seven days, to a price of $18.92. Just days ago, the CEO of Bankman-Fried's trading firm, Alameda Research, had tweeted that the outfit stood ready to buy the Binance holdings at $22 each.Data from CoinGlass shows there continues to be building short bets on FTT as open interest in the crypto-derivatives market has surged 8% during the last hour to a total of $215 million.The speculation over Bankman-Fried's FTX started after CoinDesk reported last week that a notable portion of Alameda's balance sheet was made up of FTT, which is the FTX exchange's in-house token, and the Solana blockchain's SOL.Since then, the market has grown concerned about FTX's liquidity. The exchange has faced a massive stablecoin exodus, with $451 million being sent off its main platform during the last week and $15 million being pulled from its U.S. subsidiary, according to Nansen data. Currently, FTX has a balance of $59.2 million USDC and $28.5 million USDT, along with $8.6 million BUSD. FTX US has $41 million USDC, $12.8 million USDT, $39 million PAX, and $11.3 million BUSD available.Interest rates on FTX's margin lending platform have jumped, with the exchange now paying 10% for USDT compared to a previous lending rate of 5%.Meanwhile, Binance has seen an inflow of $411 million in stablecoins over the last week, with a current balance of $26.7 billion.While users have reported some delays on fiat currency withdrawals, FTX says that it is working through the backlog and they are still being processed. Bankman-Fried, who serves as FTX's CEO, took to Twitter early Monday to say the exchange was far from insolvent and there is no risk of withdrawals being halted.Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has previously said that he plans to liquidate any remaining FTT on Binance's books, but on-chain data suggests that this hasn't yet begun.FTT is currently trading down 19% at $17.93. SOL is lower by 17% and Serum's SRM token is down 10%. The action is spilling over into bitcoin (BTC) as well, which is down 5.6% to $19,650.UPDATE (Nov. 8, 04:15 UTC): Updated with additional context and information.",2022/11/08

According to a copy of the Alameda balance sheet seen by CoinDesk, Alameda holds $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.” One theory is that Alameda might try to dump its SOL tokens in a bid to raise fresh liquidity, wrote CoinDesk’s Jocelyn Yang.Early Monday, Bankman-Fried tried to assure FTX users, tweeting: ""A competitor is trying to go after us with false rumors. FTX is fine. Assets are fine.""This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptos in market value, had a quieter day, falling about 2% and 1.3%, respectively, over the past 24 hours. BTC remained comfortably over its most recent $20,000 support level after jumping over $21,000 late last week as investors’ looked with hope at signs the U.S. Federal Reserve would scale back from its current diet of hefty, 75 basis point interest rate hikes. ETH continued to hover well above the $1,500 threshold it retook about two weeks ago.The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, was trading roughly flat.A day ahead of the U.S. midterm elections, stocks started the week on an up note as the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, rose nearly a percentage point, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed up 1.3%. Safe haven gold joined the crowd in the green, albeit barely, inching up 0.1%. Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of energy markets, held over $98, the perch it assumed late last week.As CoinDesk reported, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao tweeted that the exchange plans to its FTT tokens. Although Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison offered to buy back Binance’s entire FTT allocation, the token declined from over $25 to under $22 and is down 2.5% on the day.In his weekly Two Satoshis newsletter, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund Arca, called the contretemps between the two giants ""another blow against the industry (and financial institutions in general) simply for a lack of voluntary transparency, but it’s another giant check mark for the transparency of blockchain data and the skilled researchers trained to uncover, read, and interpret this data.""A Good Week for Exchange Tokens Not Called FTTBy Sam ReynoldsAlthough crypto continues to trade sideways, with bitcoin up only a slight 6% on month, exchange tokens pushed out solid returns — even out performing bitcoin – with the exception of FTX’s FTT.Exchange tokens offer holders discounts on fees at their respective exchanges. It’s now at $86.5 billion market, according to CoinGecko. There’s a line of thought which holds that these exchange tokens are similar to equity insofar as their price reflects the success of the platform, but there’s also a compelling argument that goes in the other direction.But during the last week, many exchange tokens even outperformed bitcoin.Over the past week, OKX’s token, OKB has climbed nearly 35%, fueled by positive news that the exchange has registered itself as a licensed digital assets business in The Bahamas.Crypto.com’s CRO token has gained just under 10% as the token slowly recovers after the exchange was hit with a double whammy of an almost 91% decline in exchange volume year-over-year and major layoffs.Binance’s BNB token found itself just slightly outperforming bitcoin. While the exchange itself has had some positive headlines over the last week, like its plan to potentially purchase a bank to bolster its licensing regime, token holders might be concerned that its getting caught in a crossfire between its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and FTX’s Sam Bankman Fried.Over the weekend, CZ tweeted that Binance was planning to liquidate its holdings of FTT after CoinDesk revealed that the balance sheet of the FTX-affiliated fund Alameda Research contained a notable amount of FTT.On Twitter, spectators quickly highlighted pointed out that liquidation of FTT holdings by a stakeholder as large as Binance would likely cause market contagion if Alameda’s balance sheet became illiquid.Given that the industry just suffered through the collapse of Three Arrows Capital, testing the resilience of Alamada’s balance sheet is something that many in the industry would prefer not to do. Still, as CoinDesk reported on Monday, open interest is building on FTT, as are negative funding rates.So far, FTT is down around 11% over the last five days.

497,"Anthony Di Iorio, the co-founder of Ethereum, Decentral and Jaxx Liberty, unveiled a project he says he’s envisioned, designed and built over the span of a decade. The project, dubbed Andiami, blends game theory with cutting-edge hardware to bring blockchain computers to a wider audience.The multi-year endeavor is seeking to counter blockchain centralization by enabling crypto users to run full nodes with little to no technical expertise. A full node is a computer that stores the complete transactional history of a blockchain network.The project's tentative timeline extends to 2025. The first year (2023) focuses on the project's game theoretic components: a game entitled The Quest for Liberty, a player kit and Digital Life Tokens that players earn in the game.Read more: THNDR Games Launches Play-to-Earn Bitcoin Solitaire Mobile GameFrom 2024 to 2025, the focus shifts to Andiami’s flagship hardware product – “The Cube”– a plug-and-play blockchain computer that runs full nodes for networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Many crypto users find the technical requirements for running full nodes too daunting. Di Iorio hopes the plug-and-play nature of The Cube, coupled with carefully crafted gamification, will make it easy and fun for users to run their favorite network’s full node, and in doing so further decentralize blockchain infrastructure.“The goal is empowering people with what they need to be in control of their digital lives. It starts with you being your own server.” Di Iorio told CoinDesk in an interview. “Anything that revolves around having a third party trusted intermediary between you and your money, or you and your identity, or you and your communications, isn't the ideal situation.”Di Iorio has been solving difficult crypto problems for many years. He wants to apply the problem-solving framework he used in prior endeavors to societal issues and has pledged $1 million to create an entity focused on this goal.“I have a framework for solving problems called ‘Perfect Formula.’ It’s a framework I built to solve problems with the end game being to create as many wins for as many stakeholders as possible,” Di Iorio explained.Many people are familiar with author Stephen Covey’s “win-win” concept that emphasizes mutually beneficial solutions to difficult problems. Di Iorio wants to extend this idea to create what he calls, “win-win-win” outcomes.""There's so much competition and divisiveness in this ecosystem, Di Iorio said. ""Our goal is to support the best projects and to give tools to the projects that aren't as good, to get better.""The idea of everyone winning together is how Andiami got its name. Di Iorio is part Italian and modified the word, “andiamo” (Italian for “let’s all go”) to better encapsulate his concept. “In Italian and in other languages, adding an “i” at the end [of a word] pluralizes it. So it's not just, ‘let's all go,’ it’s ‘let's all go together,’” Di Iorio explained.The initial phase of the Andiami project revolves around The Quest for Liberty – a game where users buy player kits containing puzzles that can be solved to unlock Digital Life Tokens. Di Iorio says player kits will retail between $500 and $5,000.“A lot of things are going to depend on demand,"" Di Iorio said. “A lot of it is dependent on how many people join the waitlist and our funding targets for selling the player kits to make sure we have the funds we need to continue at different stages.”Whatever the price ends up being, users will need to purchase player kits containing “Non-Fungible Phygitals” (NFP) – physical items like player cards, embedded with NFC (near-field communication) authentication chips to link digital and physical worlds together.Read more: Tech Behemoths Could Become ‘Dinosaurs’ if They Enter the Metaverse for the Wrong Reasons, Deepak Chopra Says“‘Non-Fungible Phygital' is a term I coined and we're going to be using it in all the products we put out. From the puzzle books, to the puzzle cards, to the player kits,” Di Iorio said. “So when you tap a card, it uses public and private key cryptography to verify authenticity.”With player kits and “phygitals” in hand, players will use what Di Iorio calls, “Proof of Puzzle Solve” (POPS) to unlock Digital Life Tokens that will function as the default currency in the Andiami ecosystem.Andiami will culminate with the launch of The Cube. Di Iorio describes it as a specialized, plug-and-play computer specifically designed to run a variety of full nodes. Just as there are gaming consoles for gamers, Di Iorio wants to build blockchain computers for crypto users.“They're specific just like gaming consoles. They're made to be blockchain computers. They're unique depending on which chain they are,” Di Iorio explained. “We've got Cardano, we've got Cosmos, we've got Polkadot, we've got Bitcoin, we've got Litecoin. These are all boxes we've already created and have running right now.”Di Iorio says he’s spent years perfecting a system that enables his company’s infrastructure to run with little to no downtime. Jaxx Liberty is a cryptocurrency wallet that runs multiple blockchains and dozens of tokens. He plans to bring that system, tentatively named, “NodeX,” into the hands of retail users.“We've developed a system that doesn't require any maintenance. Because when you're running a node, one of the biggest issues is technical difficulties,” Di Iori said.Andiami’s goal is to further decentralize crypto infrastructure. Much of crypto’s infrastructure is run on giant cloud computing provider platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or outsourced to infrastructure firms like Infura. Andiami’s end game is to transition that infrastructure to regular users by making it less intimidating to run a full node.One way to accelerate that transition is by creating a “node sharing” protocol that connects Cube owners over the Internet, allowing them to earn rewards for sharing their infrastructure resources.“If AWS shuts down, more than 50% of Ethereum is gone, Di Iorio said. ""That’s nuts! That's not how Ethereum was planned. That's not how Bitcoin was planned. So our line is, you can't have a user-controlled Internet unless the user has their own server.”Read more: Ethereum Already Showing Signs of Increased CentralizationUPDATE (Nov. 8, 17:45 UTC): Added ""Non-Fungible"" in 15th paragraph and included event photo.",2022/11/08
498,"CORRECTION (Nov. 8, 01:02 UTC): A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Riot's consensus analyst estimate was for adjusted net earnings of $1 per share, instead of 1 cent.Bitcoin mining heavyweight Riot Blockchain (RIOT) disappointed average analysts' expectations in its third quarter.The miner generated $46.3 million in revenue, lower than the average estimate of $56.3 million, bringing net loss to 24 cents, compared to a consensus estimate of adjusted net earnings per share of 1 cent according to FactSet.Riot's revenue were lower than the previous quarter's $72.9 million, and lower than for the same period last year, when the firm reported $64.8 million. The miner attributed the decrease to the declining price of bitcoin and to its curtailing of activities in response to surging energy demand in Texas, according to a press release on Monday.RIOT's share price was down about 1% in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq, following the release of its earnings report.The miners cash reserves, however, didn't move much compared to the previous quarter, even as other major miners are saying that they are close to bankruptcy. Riot had $255 million of cash on hand and 6,766 BTC at the end of the third quarter, compared to $270.5 million in cash and 6,653 BTC at the end of the second quarte.Riot is one of many miners participating in curtailment processes in Texas, under which they power off their machines when demand surges across the electrical grid in exchange for credits they can use later with the local grid operator. Riot earned $13.1 million in such credits throughout the quarter, $9.5 million of which came in July. Its bitcoin production for that month was down 28% as it participated in this so-called demand response program.The miners' hosting revenue, meaning fees it collects for providing infrastructure to other companies' machines, also decreased quarter-on-quarter from $8.4 million to $9.8 million.Riot's mining margins have dropped significantly, similar to other miners. In the second quarter of this year, mining revenue in excess of cost of revenue for the segment was $28.2 million, or 61% of revenue from mining. In the third quarter, it was $7.4 million, about 33% of total mining revenue.Read more: Wall Street Analyst ‘Pulling the Plug’ on Bitcoin Miners Owing to Bear Market Woes",2022/11/07

500,"Crypto investors will be noting two significant macro events this week: the Nov. 8 midterm elections and the Nov. 10 Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.How crypto prices will react to the midterms is unclear. Democrats and Republicans are more focused on gaining control of the House of Representatives and Senate than debating crypto policies.Investors will be eyeing whether the CPI veers much from an expected 6.5% increase that will signal inflation remains untamed, potentially testing anew cryptos’ status as an inflation hedge.Meanwhile, the crypto industry breathlessly considered questions about the solvency of crypto exchange FTX and the impact on its sister company, Alameda Research. As CoinDesk reported over the weekend, much of Alameda’s equity appears to consist of FTX’s FTT token. The outsized percentage of FTX’s value tied to an asset issued by a related entity has raised concerns about a repeat of issues that have already sent three of the industry’s biggest brands this year – crypto lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital and hedge fund Three Arrows Capital – into bankruptcy.FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried tweeted unequivocally that FTX and its assets “are fine.”""FTX has enough to cover all client holdings,"" he wrote. ""We don't invest client assets (even in Treasurys). We have been processing all withdrawals, and will continue to be.""When Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao announced earlier that his crypto exchange would liquidate all remaining FTT on its books, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison responded that her company would “happily buy back” FTT at $22 from them.At the time, FTT was trading in a $21 to $24 range. An offer to bid at $22 aligned with market conditions.Still, FTT’s $22 price is significant when considering the asset’s trading volume. The Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) tool determines an asset’s potential areas of support and resistance. It provides a visual representation of trading volume by price level, and indicates areas of high or low agreement on price.An asset’s price tends to move slowly in “high volume node” areas, as there is generally sufficient market demand at those particular price levels.Prices often move rapidly through “low volume node” areas and can lead to rapid increases or decreases dependent on market direction.What this implies for FTX is that if its price cannot be defended at the $22 level, buying demand doesn’t appear again until close to $10.It can be argued that another significant decrease in activity exists below $10, until approximately $5.FTT’s recent price decline dovetailed with a significant spike in volume, which is generally a bearish sign.Whether the FTX and Alameda rumors have substance remains unclear. FTT’s price was recently 0.26% higher, actually outpacing BTC.The most important question is whether a decline in FTT, and potential insolvency of FTX and Alameda would have a negative spillover impact on the prices of BTC and ETH.This would likely only take place if FTX and/or Alameda had to liquidate BTC and ETH holdings to shore up its liquidity.Little in bitcoin or ether’s current price action indicates as such.",2022/11/07
501,"Solana’s SOL token was one of the biggest losers in digital-asset markets on Monday, and crypto analysts speculated there might be a connection to the recent drama surrounding Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange and his trading firm, Alameda Research.One theory is that Alameda might try to dump its SOL tokens in a bid to raise fresh liquidity.“The large amounts of SOL and Solana ecosystem tokens held by Alameda could get sold off in a worst-case scenario and underline the close links between FTX/Alameda and Solana,” said Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko.The SOL token plunged 4.7% in the past 24 hours.This week’s kerfuffle in crypto markets has evolved into a full-blown face-off between two of the industry’s biggest titans. It began when Changpeng Zhao, CEO of the rival exchange Binance, tweeted that his firm would sell its holdings of FTX’s exchange token, FTT – a stake reportedly worth more than $500 million. The token happens to be one of the biggest holdings on Alameda’s balance sheet, raising thorny questions about the blurry divisions between Bankman-Fried’s trading firm and the FTX exchange.The FTT price rebounded after Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison tweeted that the company would happily buy Binance's FTT tokens for $22 each.So a key question is how Alameda might pay for the FTT tokens if the trading firm were to step up as a buyer of the Binance stake.SOL is Alameda's second-largest holding, and it also holds significant amounts of SOL ecosystem tokens like MAPS and OXY, according to Carey.CoinDesk previously reported that a copy of Alameda's balance sheet shows the firm held $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.”Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at research firm FundStrat, wrote Monday in a note that he expects Binance and Alameda to eventually reach an over-the-counter deal to “move all of Binance's FTT without adversely affecting the prevailing market price.”It could be that the SOL token is falling because of market pressures entirely unrelated to the FTX-Binance tete-a-tete.The token spiked as much as 15% on Saturday after Google Cloud tagged the blockchain’s co-founder in a tweet that suggested an important disclosure was underway, before making the formal partnership announcement.Then, on Sunday, the SOL price tumbled, in what may have been a classic case of “buy the rumor, sell the news,” according to Carey.There’s also the simple possibility that the token was losing steam after the Solana blockchain’s big Breakpoint conference taking place in Lisbon, Portugal; the event concludes Monday. Such post-conference market fades aren’t out of the ordinary.Other major crypto assets were also falling on Monday midday: bitcoin (BTC) was trading at around $20,800, down 1.6%, while ether (ETH) was down 0.4% to $1,600 as of press time.The CoinDesk Market Index was down 0.1%.Traditional markets edged up as traders prepared for the U.S. midterm elections on Tuesday and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data on Thursday. The Standard and Poor's 500 index was up 0.9%.BTC has been holding at over $20,000 recently, giving a boost to investor confidence.“It feels to me like bitcoin did all of its selling off ahead of the market,” Greg King, founder and CEO of asset management firm Osprey FundsOsprey Funds, told CoinDesk TV on Monday. “The market is sort of catching up.”",2022/11/07

503,"If you haven’t read “Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital” (2002) by Carlota Perez, I thoroughly recommend it. It’s a boring title for a mind-blowing book with beautiful language that is almost guaranteed to trigger a sequence of “aha!” moments, whatever industry you happen to be working in.Her main thesis is that major technological shifts follow a pattern that takes them from creation through to obsolescence, launching “golden ages” of progress and prosperity along the rather bumpy way. She divides the sequence into five sections:Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.The crypto industry is clearly at the Turning Point in the above framework. It’s not just the recent bursting of the Frenzy Phase that makes this obvious – it’s also the headlines that cross our screens every day, with their emphasis on regulatory exploration, infrastructure build and new ecosystem participants. Some could try to argue that 2018 was the Turning Point, but the technology was still too immature back then, the global acceptance still too thin and the bear market too “dry” in terms of meaningful development.The entrance of institutional and other types of investors in 2021 and the rapid growth of high-yield crypto products triggered a level of speculation much more widespread than the initial coin offering (ICO) craze of 2017, masking significant progress on crypto deployment, which in the Turning Point is taking on a heightened protagonism.Some of Perez’s observations about the Turning Point seem eerily prescient (all quotes from her book):See also: Bitcoin Is Macro, but Not 'Correlated' in the Way You Think | OpinionIt’s important to note that Perez is not attempting to predict the future. She is condensing the experience of five previous technological revolutions going back to the 1700s (factory production, steam/railway, steel/electricity, oil/cars/mass production and telecommunication) into recognizable patterns. And yet she could just as easily be talking about the evolution of the crypto industry to date, even though it did not exist at time of publication. If the pattern she describes holds, the current stage is about to unleash a wave of adoption and acceptance that will shape a “golden age” of prosperity – such as those birthed by previous waves of tech innovation. That, in turn, could unleash not just greater efficiencies and access but also a new social structure.It’s not hard to see a parallel to what famed macro investor Ray Dalio has been saying for some time: that we are near a fundamental paradigm shift as our societal systems become unstable, crumble and leave room for a new framework to emerge phoenix-like from the ashes.According to Perez’s research, the Turning Point lasts anywhere between a few months to a few years, so we could have a way to go yet before the “deployment period” kicks off. But the tone and pace of recent progress suggests the transition is underway.The Turning Point initiates a shift from “financial capital,” which prioritizes short-term gain, to “production capital” which focuses more on development. In crypto, production capital has been plugging away all along. But its prominence has recently changed. Rather than celebrations of record prices and assets under management (AUM) growth, headlines these days are more focused on technological leaps forward as much of the recent behind-the-scenes work is brought to light, setting the stage for a new phase of growth.See also: The Myth of 'Regulatory Clarity' | OpinionEthereum’s Merge is perhaps the most high-profile example. The flurry of projects building on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is another. There’s also progress on cross-chain interoperability, milestones reached by zero-knowledge rollup scaling technology, the launch of layer 1 blockchains, funding for new types of custody systems, known financial names launching crypto products, legacy banks and investment funds kicking the tires on blockchain-based security issuance, and much more.Another key feature of Turning Points is the design of regulatory frameworks that have been conspicuously absent during the first two initial phases. We are certainly seeing this now, with the arduous progress of the European Union’s set of crypto rules (known as MiCA) and the response of many official U.S. agencies to President Joe Biden’s executive order mandating a comprehensive approach to digital asset regulation. There’s also the global focus on stablecoins and many local initiatives regarding crypto asset trading, as well as the recognition that international coordination would make illicit transactions easier to block.So, why is all this important? Because it gives us reassurance that the current turmoil is merely a painful phase on the path to better times. We tend to misunderstand the meaning of the word “revolution” – taken literally, it means the coverage of a full cycle, a return to origin in order to begin anew. While the cycles outlined do not “return to origin,” they do follow a pattern that sketches out the likely evolution of the new technologies we grapple with today. In so doing, they give our current macro and crypto turmoil a refreshing perspective. Things may look bleak at the moment and many will suffer, which is never good. But the historical context colors the pervasive uncertainty with the comforting rhythm of history.The patterns described also help us to see the significance of the recent shift in the ecosystem’s expectations. While we may lament the loss of our recent heyday with abundant profits and creative overreach, we can feel reassured that what we are going through is a necessary phase to weed out the hype and focus on real-world impact. We’ve been here before and, through the lens of history, it turned out well.However, Perez’s book includes a description of the Turning Point that could be taken as a warning:“It can establish institutions for increasing social cohesiveness, improving income distribution and general well-being or it can try to reinstate the ‘selfish prosperity’ of the frenzy phase, though more closely connected with real production and finding some means to expand demand,” she writes.We seem to be on the path to the former scenario. The damage done by the collapse of the Terra stablecoin ecosystem, the Three Arrows Capital hedge fund and some crypto lenders left deep scars that, combined with intensifying regulatory scrutiny as well as self-governance, will no doubt influence risk attitudes for at least a while. Take into account the tone of crypto headlines of late with their heavy emphasis on infrastructure, governance and partnerships, and a picture emerges of an industry with strong conviction, broadening acceptance and the growing involvement of different sections of society.The Synergy Phase with its optimistic promise may be some ways ahead still. But we are heading toward it.",2022/11/07
504,"Bitcoin mining firm Iris Energy (IREN) is facing claims from its lender alleging that it has defaulted on $103 million of equipment loans held by two special-purpose vehicles (SPV), the company said on Monday.The reason for the notice of default, which the lender sent to the miner on Nov. 4, is the company failed to engage in ""good faith restructuring discussions"" for the debt in question, according to a Monday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Because Iris failed to engage in such discussions, the lender is claiming it defaulted on payments originally scheduled for Oct. 25, the Monday filing said. As such, the filing continued, the lender looks to trigger an acceleration clause, meaning it is demanding immediate payment of the entire principal and accrued interest. Iris said it ""disagrees"" with the allegations made by the lender in the Nov. 4 notice.To review, on Nov. 2, Iris Energy said the bitcoin mining machines in question do not produce enough cash to cover the related debt obligations. The company said at that time that if discussions to restructure the debt fail to lead to an agreement by Nov. 8, it would not be able to meet the debt obligations held by the two SPVs.The two loans in question – which as of Sept. 30 had principal amounts of $32 million and $71 million – are secured by 1.6 exahash/second (EH/s) and 2.0 EH/s of mining machines, respectively, the company said. The debt is held by two wholly-owned, non-recourse SPVs, meaning in the event of default the lender will not be able to seize any Iris Energy assets other than the collateral.The loans appear to be from troubled lender NYDIG, based on past press releases.Iris Energy is one of several bitcoin mining firms struggling to repay their debt obligations during this bear market that has seen rewards dwindle alongside soaring energy costs. September saw the first Chapter 11 bankruptcy from a major player, Compute North, with other big firms including Core Scientific (CORZ) and Argo Blockchain (ARBK) seemingly teetering on the edge of solvency.In the Monday filing there's also a third loan for $1 million – also held by a wholly owned SPV and secured by 0.2 EH/s of miners – that received a different notice for another potential event of default from the lender.If an agreement for restructuring the debt is not reached by Tuesday, Iris Energy will not provide further financing support to the SPVs, said the company, likely leading to default and foreclosing of assets.Only 2.4 EH/s of the the company's machines are unaffected by the equipment loans.Iris shares are up marginally late on Monday morning, trading at $2.80 each.CORRECTION AND UPDATE (Nov. 7, 22:53 UTC): Corrects description in the fourth paragraph of non-recourse financing to say that in the event of default the lender will not be able to seize any assets other than the collateral; adds detail about NYDIG in the fifth paragraph.",2022/11/07
505,"Since the inception of bitcoin in 2008, the digital asset industry has been growing at a rapid pace, accelerating the emergence of the new digital finance economy. This booming new asset class has resulted in the development of new investment vehicles and opportunities with thousands of different projects, use cases and applications using blockchain technology to transform industry infrastructure. While there is a wide range of estimates on the number of existing cryptocurrencies, the growth is clear. As of Oct. 26, 2022, coinmarketcap.com, coingecko.com and investing.com listed 21,522, 13,260, and 9,409 coins, respectively.Number of Cryptocurrencies Worldwide From 2013 to August 2022This extraordinary growth has created a commensurate amount of complexity. To help investors better understand the digital asset space, CoinDesk Indices introduced the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS). DACS provides the market with a reliable structure and transparency to help classify and simplify the industries inside the asset class. DACS also serves as the fundamental framework and foundation that supports CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) benchmarks for performance measurement and CoinDesk Select Indices for building investment strategies.This paper covers our process of narrowing the universe of digital assets for investable indices. It outlines how DACS defines and organizes industries for digital asset categorization, then reviews minimum eligibility for inclusion in benchmarks to provide market measurements. It finally describes the stricter criteria for inclusion in investable indices.CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS)Using a classification standard to define markets is not a new concept. The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), developed by MSCI and Standard & Poor’s in 1999, has been widely used by equity investors to classify publicly traded companies globally. Research shows GICS explains stock return co-movements within sectors, helping investors determine important drivers for company valuations, identify relative value opportunities by comparing companies in the same sector and develop sector level macro insights to make decisions on asset allocation.Furthermore, sector indices developed based on GICS have become the backbone of investor allocation, risk and performance-evaluation models. According to a recent Index Industry Association (IIA) benchmark survey, approximately 1.47 million sector- or industry-based indices are calculated daily, which is nearly half of all available equity indices. This truly speaks to the power of GICS to modernize equity investing.While DACS is unique to digital assets, it serves many of the same functions as classification systems used for traditional asset classes. Among other things, DACS provides the market with a transparent and standardized method to determine sector and industry exposure, facilitate portfolio attribution analysis and help pinpoint investment opportunities.DACS is designed to define and organize the industries of digital assets to enable each of the top 500 eligible digital assets by market capitalization to be assigned to an industry based on its use case and technology. Then, each industry is assigned to an industry group and each industry group is assigned to a sector. This classification currently results in a three-tiered hierarchy. The industry, industry group and sector definitions in the DACS glossary provide a common language for the industry. The definitions set the framework for the standard taxonomy of digital assets.To be included in DACS, digital assets must be covered by CoinMarketCap.com and ranked in the top 500 digital assets. However, any asset with significantly contested or disputed circulating supply data, lack of transparency in the form of public documentation and white papers, or assets that are no longer in operation or have been restructured will be excluded from DACS. Moreover, assets that are considered a gas token, staked token or wrapped are not currently eligible for inclusion in DACS.The assignment of an industry to a digital asset is based on the asset’s actual or intended use case or application. This is determined by reviewing available documentation or white papers on the project’s website, its social media channels, on-chain activity, third party audits, peer reviews or other publicly available information.Once the use case and/or application has been determined, the digital asset will be assigned to the most appropriate Industry, using the definitions in the Glossary. The Industry assignment will be guided by identifying the dominant use case or application of the digital asset and identifying digital assets with similar use cases or applications.Industry definitions as defined in the Glossary may require modifications because they are intended to account for new use cases or applications not previously considered. The definitions should reflect accurately current terminology in the digital asset space and provide clarifications, increase transparency and improve consistency.The DACS structure will also be modified as needed to capture the evolution of the digital asset market. These changes may include expanding or collapsing the number of sectors, industry groups or industries. The changes might also involve migrating industry groups or industries within the DACS hierarchy as well as material changes to existing definitions used to classify a digital asset.Any modification to the DACS structure will be announced publicly with appropriate lead time prior to implementation. These changes are generally determined based on market input and feedback. To facilitate these discussions, CoinDesk Indices may issue public consultations to provide analysis and proposals seeking feedback to help inform its final decision. Additionally, the DACS Advisory Council is composed of key digital asset market participants and other influential individuals within the digital asset space to assist CoinDesk Indices in determining potential changes to the DACS structure.Lastly, DACS is governed by the DACS Committee, which is responsible for the oversight of the DACS structure, definitions, and classifications. Material changes to the DACS structure and/or DACS Methodology must be reviewed and approved by the DACS Committee prior to implementation.Although DACS serves a vital role in defining, organizing and categorizing the industries and digital assets based on their use cases and technology to provide a common language and standard taxonomy to classify tokens, it is unable to measure markets to support investment strategy. Therefore, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) Family was developed to enable performance measurement of the broad digital asset market and its segments.CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) FamilyBenchmark indices are often the most underrated yet most powerful drivers of returns. This is because indices are used throughout the investment process at nearly every critical decision-making stage. First, indices are often used as the asset class proxy in asset allocation models to decide how much to allocate for a given set of goals. Then, benchmarks are used to find managers that outperform or are uncorrelated so the money can be put to work. Managers often use the constituents of the benchmark as their starting universe and further use the benchmark sector and constituent weights as the anchor to overweight or underweight positions, or even go short for hedge funds, in their strategies. Beyond the technical data, the industry fundamentals are used in sector- or factor-focused rotation strategies and for peer group valuations. Then, in post-investment analysis, benchmarks help answer the question whether managers did a good job.The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) and its subindices are a family of broad-based digital asset indices designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market. The family includes indices that reflect sectors defined in DACS.The CMI Methodology narrows the DACS digital asset universe by requiring minimum pricing, then market cap weighting the eligible assets. There are four major eligibility criteria for assets to be included in the CMI family:1. Inclusion in the latest DACS report2. Must be listed on at least two eligible exchanges3. Must be listed on an Eligible Exchange* for a minimum of 30 days4. Pricing must be available by a CoinDesk reference price**The constituents that meet the above four requirements are then weighted by market capitalization. They are reconstituted and rebalanced on a monthly basis. The CMI index family is calculated in real time using reference rates for each asset.Given that the goal of CMI is to be as broad as possible, it aims to capture all digital assets that meet the Eligibility Criteria including stablecoins and meme coins. It provides a broad representation of the performance of the digital asset market and its segments. Therefore, it may include digital assets that are relatively illiquid or otherwise difficult to access, own, trade or custody. Digital assets that meet all eligibility criteria are included regardless of their designation as a security by a government agency.Currently, the CMI eligibility criteria narrows the 500 digital assets assigned by DACS to 150 digital assets, covering 89% of the market cap. While CMI serves a solid role in performance measurement for various use cases, it is generally not replicable for tracking products like funds or derivatives. Therefore, the CoinDesk Select Indices were created to deliver investable index strategies.CoinDesk Select IndicesThe innovations in financial products from derivatives to ETFs and now tokenized funds have increased demand for investable indices that serve as the underlying strategies for these tracking products. Although the growth of index strategies has exploded in traditional and alternative asset classes, the digital asset indices that are intended to underpin investment products are relatively new due to specific requirements by investors. Therefore, the CoinDesk Select Indices are designed to measure the performance of some of the largest and most liquid digital assets classified in DACS that meet certain trading and custody requirements.Generally, the CoinDesk Select Indices*** include five to 10 assets that meet stricter eligibility criteria than the simple availability of pricing and market cap data. There are four major eligibility criteria to determine the Select Index Universe:1. The digital asset must be ranked in the top 200 in the latest published DACS report.2. Custodian services for the digital asset must be available from Coinbase Custody, a division of Coinbase Global Inc., and the digital asset must be accessible by U.S. investors.3. The digital asset must not be a stablecoin or categorized as a meme coin as determined by CDI.4. The digital asset must have been listed on an Eligible Exchange for a minimum of 30 days.Next, the top 20 digital assets from the Index Universe are ranked by market cap to determine Selection Universe before the constituents are chosen. Five to 10 digital assets are included from the Selection Universe by their median daily value traded and median market cap, where higher thresholds are required for non-constituents than for incumbent constituents. The median daily value traded and median market cap values need to be greater than or equal to 1.2 times the 30-day median for non-constituents, and constituents need to have greater than or equal to the 30-day median for constituents. Non-constituents must be on Watchlist by passing all eligibility criteria for one quarter ahead of the quarter a digital asset may be added to the index.While the selected assets may be weighted in various ways including by market cap, equally weighted or risk weighted, the market cap weighted results generally maintain the sector exposures in proportion to the broad set of digital assets. The process in narrowing the universe from 500 digital assets assigned in DACS to currently 150 digital assets in the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) and further to the current set of 28 assets in the Select Sectors enables investors to access the market beta with relatively few assets. Because the digital asset market is still emerging and highly concentrated, the set of fewer assets covers most of the market cap with just over 5% (28 digital assets) of assets covering nearly 75% of the entire market cap.ConclusionThe incredible growth in digital assets beyond bitcoin has created numerous investment opportunities across the new economy. However, finding those investment opportunities in the sea of digital assets requires a deep understanding of use cases and technology combined with expertise about Investability. Narrowing the digital asset universe by pricing availability, liquidity, exchange and custodial requirements is critical to determine which digital assets are appropriate for quality investors. The methodical practices developed to organize the digital asset universe and select the largest and most liquid constituents representing the asset class and its sectors may help investors throughout their investment processes.Footnotes:* Eligible Exchanges listed in the CoinDesk Digital Asset Indices Policy Methodology, Binance.US, BitFlyer, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Coinbase Pro, ErisX, FTX.US, Gemini, itBit, Kraken, LMAX Digital, Okcoin.** Real-time “spot” reference price rates for constituent digital assets are calculated approximately every 5 seconds by CDI using a volume weighted average price (VWAP) across at least two contributing exchanges over the prior 60 minutes.*** The CoinDesk Select Indices currently include the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index, CoinDesk Industry Group Select Equal Weight Index, CoinDesk Select Sector Index and CoinDesk Select Industry Group Index.

506,"Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said Monday that authorities seized 50,676 bitcoins related to the darknet marketplace Silk Road in November.The bitcoin was valued at $3.36 billion at the time it was discovered. Now it is worth $1.04 billion. In November, it was the largest cryptocurrency seizure to date, but has since been surpassed by the 70,000 bitcoins seized in February in relation to a hack of the Bitfinex crypto exchange.In the Silk Road case, the coins were found at an address in Georgia connected with James Zhong. The feds also found $661,900 in cash as well as various precious metals. Zhong pleaded guilty to committing wire fraud in 2012, according to a statement from the Justice Department on Monday.""This case shows that we won’t stop following the money, no matter how expertly hidden, even to a circuit board in the bottom of a popcorn tin,” Williams said in the statement.The Silk Road was an illegal marketplace on the darknet that operated between 2011 and 2013 and that primarily used bitcoin as a method of payment. The site collapsed following the arrest of its operator, Ross Ulbricht, who is serving a double life sentence and 40 years in prison, without the possibility of parole.In 2014, U.S. marshals auctioned off several tranches of seized bitcoin, with 50,000 coins being sold for $20 million followed by a 30,000-coin auction a few months earlier.Zhong manipulated Silk Road's withdrawal system by triggering 140 transactions in rapid succession, fooling the system into crediting several external wallets with the bitcoin, according to the Justice Department.UPDATE (Nov. 7, 15:27 UTC): Adds context throughout and updates current value of bitcoin seized.UPDATE (Nov. 7, 15:47 UTC): Adds quote in fourth paragraph, largest seizure in second.",2022/11/07

509,"Traders in Asia awoke to a market partially in the red as the digital assets industry continues to deal with the controversy over trading firm Alameda Research’s balance sheet.FTX’s FTT exchange token, which makes up a significant amount of Alameda's assets, is down 5% on day as Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao publicly feuded with Alameda’s CEO Caroline Ellison about selling off Binance’s FTT holdings.Exchange balances of FTT are also surging, according to data provided by Glassnode. Typically, high exchange balances imply that there's a lot of liquidity for buying and selling tokens. This usually results in a downwards price trend as traders look to sell tokens.Data from Nansen shows that FTX is suffering from a major spike in exchange outflows. During the last week approximately $292 million in stablecoins have left FTX. Traders could be departing the exchange over fears of liquidity issues, as Alameda is a large market maker on FTX.Meanwhile, Solana, a token backed by Alameda and FTX, is down 11% on day. According to a copy of the Alameda balance sheet seen by CoinDesk, Alameda holds $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.”Also caught in the market turmoil is Binance’s BNB token, which is down 4%.Perhaps the fears of a full-blown liquidity crisis are overblown as market leaders bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) held steady.

And sign up for First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.By Bradley KeounThe weekend brought no shortage of crypto-markets drama, but it wasn't about bitcoin: Intense speculation appeared to drive steep losses on the FTX exchange's FTT token and Solana's SOL.The FTX token, which pushed into headlines (and Twitter chatter) last week after CoinDesk reported just how significant of an asset it was on the trading firm Alameda Research's balance sheet, came under additional pressure after Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted that the firm would sell its remaining holdings of FTT, a stake worth more than $500 million. The FTT price rebounded after the CEO of Alameda, which like FTX is a part of billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried's empire, tweeted that it would happily buy FTT at $22 each. But by late Sunday FTT had reversed course and was falling again, around $22.24, down 7.6% over the past 24 hours.Solana's SOL spiked as Google Cloud announced plans to become a validator on the blockchain network, but by press time it, too, had turned lower and was one of the day's biggest losers among the 162 assets in the CoinDesk Market Index, down 11% over 24 hours. The token had gained in the weeks leading up to Solana's Breakpoint conference currently taking place in Lisbon, Portugal, concluding Monday. These blockchain conferences often bring a slew of announcements that tend to rile up investors, developers and fans, but it's not uncommon for the enthusiasm to fade quickly.Dogecoin (DOGE), which more than doubled in October to become the top performer in the CMI, is now licking its wounds; the meme token frequently mentioned by billionaire Elon Musk (Twitter's new owner) is down 19% so far this month.Bitcoin (BTC), for what it's worth, was trading around $21,000 after hitting a fresh seven-week high on Saturday. The largest cryptocurrency's recent gains has pushed it over key levels on price charts, potentially signaling a crucial shift toward a more bullish trend.Equity markets finished last week on a moderate upswing as the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed Friday up more than a percentage point – in sync with a 4.7% gain that day for bitcoin. Safe haven gold swung upward 3%, a rare exception to its recent form. Brent crude oil, a widely regarded measure of energy markets, climbed near $99 per barrel, a 5% increase from the start of the week.In the coming week, crypto traders will be focused on Tuesday's midterm elections in the U.S., which might have major implications for regulatory policy or economic decisions. Then, on Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department is due to report the latest reading of the Consumer Price Index, expected to show that the main inflation rate staying at 8% or higher in October – still not too far from a four-decade high, and indicating just how much work the Federal Reserve has to do to cool off the economy and bring the figure back down.""The midterms and inflation data will no doubt keep market participants busy,"" Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a report.By Sam ReynoldsJPMorgan’s Umar Farooq, its blockchain unit boss, said something in very plain language about the future of institutional involvement in crypto during the Singapore Fintech Festival: ""We cannot lose their money.""Farooq was referring to exactly what it would take for banks to get involved in digital assets. Consumer protection, alongside the ability to identify both parties in the transaction, is key to building a digital assets sector that can be integrated into the world’s banking system and with its trillions in assets.Think about what happens if you send crypto to the wrong wallet. It’s gone, as Coinbase puts it bluntly on a help page.“Due to the irreversible nature of cryptocurrency protocols, transactions can't be canceled or reversed once initiated,” the exchange writes. “Because of this, it is essential to exercise caution when sending and make sure the address you are sending to is an exact match of the recipient's address.”Chainanalysis estimates that around 20% of all bitcoin has been lost in this fashion, and is unrecoverable. Anecdotes of eight-figure amounts effectively evaporating because they were sent to the wrong wallet abound.This certainly happens in the traditional finance world as well.But in TradFi there are ways to reverse these transactions. SWIFT has a built-in recall mechanism, which has saved victims of various forms of wire fraud collectively hundreds of millions of dollars. In the United States, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) acts as a watchdog over the remittance industry and provides consumer protections, such as the right to cancel a money transfer and the right to resolve mistakes. These mechanisms don’t exist in crypto.As a technicality, one could say parts of crypto have this but only when the wallets are KYC’ed, or follow Know Your Customer rules. For example, Crypto.com sued a woman in Melbourne who was mistakenly refunded $10 million.SBF weighs inFTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried caught some flak from the libertarian wing of big crypto by suggesting in a policy white paper that there’s a necessity for KYC and respecting the Treasury Department’s sanction wing, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).“Maintaining a blocklist is a good balance: prohibiting illegal transfers and freezing funds associated with financial crimes while otherwise allowing commerce,” SBF wrote. “To be clear, this does not mean that passports and social security numbers are necessary to buy a bagel from 7-11 – but issuances and redemptions of stablecoins should be [Bank Secrecy Act]-level KYC'ed activity.”SBF sees this as a necessity to integrate crypto into the pools of liquidity worth trillions of dollars in the TradFi market.Erik Voorhees dismissed this all as tyranny and appeared to have the support of many people behind him.But dismissing this as tyranny is going to be a nonstarter for people like JPMorgan’s Farooq.“I can’t foresee people being able to send money across borders if no one checks and no one knows who’s sending money to who, because sooner or later they will be in a money-laundering incident,” he’s quoted as saying. “Those are the very fundamental things that need to be addressed before you even get to systematic issues.”While a certain degree of sympathy has to be extended to the libertarians because of how laggardly and geriatric regulators have historically been, dismissing the need for some oversight of crypto by calling it “tyranny” invites the industry to establish more regulatory controls.Yes, rules about securities that stem from court cases that occurred in the 1940s need to be updated. But there have to be rules.By not speaking the same language as regulators, it’s a ticket to missing out on an opportunity worth trillions of dollars. Farooq and SBF both want to make digital assets mainstream, and know what needs to happen. It's people like Erik Voorhees who are holding things back.10:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(2:00 UTC) China Trade Balance USD (Oct)7:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(23:30 UTC) Japan's Overall Household Spending (YoY) (Sept)7:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(23:30 UTC) Australia Westpac Consumer Confidence (Nov)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Pops After October Jobs Report; Coinbase Sees Crypto Headwinds Continuing Into 2023The U.S. economy added 261,000 jobs in October, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.7%.

The market was looking for any signal of the “slowdown” of interest rate hikes Powell hinted at a few rate hikes ago, and it found that in the press release. But when Powell started talking, markets reinterpreted what they’d just heard, especially because of this comment:He was then later asked about “lag effects” (aka the time between the Fed’s rate increases and its actual economic impact) and Powell dropped the bombshell about it being premature to talk about a rate-hike pause. The S&P 500 puked.What’s more, the S&P 500 got whipped around even more than bitcoin (BTC) – you know, the famously volatile Magic Internet Money. The Fed press release came out at 2 p.m. ET. The S&P 500’s gain peaked at 0.7% about a half hour later, but it ended the day down 2.3%. Meanwhile, bitcoin peaked at a post-Fed press release gain of 1.3% and ended with a 1.5% loss.Volatility has a specific definition, and two weeks is hardly statistically significant, but this marks the second week in a row when bitcoin’s relative stability showed the stock market who The Adult in the room was.Read more: Can You Believe It? Bitcoin Looks Stable – Green, Even – as Big Tech Stocks Fall ApartI’ve been waiting a long time to write this and actually mean it (from a markets perspective, at least), but honey badger really doesn’t care. The honey badger being an endearing term bitcoiners use to describe bitcoin.In the last two weeks, we’ve seen the Fed signal a willingness to keep raising rates to get inflation down, a hot jobs report and general macroeconomic uncertainty. That pushed both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100 (another U.S. stock market proxy) down. Meanwhile, bitcoin rose.I know this could change easily overnight, but for the time being, it looks like bitcoin is shrugging off the uncertainty.My colleague Glenn Williams Jr. put it best:My conclusion is one of two things: Either bitcoin has now truly arrived as a macro asset or value is meaningless again since dogecoin (DOGE), a cryptocurrency that was quite literally created as a joke, doubled in price in October.",2022/11/06
512,"Litecoin mining difficulty is at a new high, peaking at just under 18 million hashes, according to a post by the Litecoin Foundation on cryptocurrency market data site coinmarketcap.com.Mining difficulty measures the average number of hashes required to “solve” a block. Litecoin miners compete by generating random hashes to find one lower than the target set by the network’s mining algorithm. Whoever wins this computationally intensive lottery gets to add a new block to the Litecoin blockchain and earns a reward.The increase in Litecoin’s mining difficulty likely means the competition for miner rewards is heating up.The cryptocurrency, sometimes referred to as “digital silver,” also has a “halvening” event on the horizon. When Litecoin was launched in 2011, miners received 50 litecoins (LTC) for successfully mining a block. That reward (called a “subsidy”) is halved every 840,000 blocks (roughly every four years). The third halving takes place in 2023 and reduces the current 12.5 LTC subsidy to 6.25 LTC.The price of LTC is holding steady, trading at $68.04 at the time of publication. However, on Wednesday, LTC’s price spiked 13% in a single day, probably due to payments giant MoneyGram’s announcement that its U.S. customers will soon be able to buy, sell and hold LTC, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) in the MoneyGram mobile app.Read more: MoneyGram Debuts Crypto Purchases on Mobile App",2022/11/05
513,"Crypto investors liked the tone of the latest jobs report and other economic indicators this week, sending bitcoin to a seven-week high and other cryptos well into the green.The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently still around $21,000, up about 4% for the last 24 hours and over the upper end of the narrow range it has occupied for weeks.

Other altcoins enjoyed an upbeat Friday, with MATIC recently rising more than 21% and CRO up over 11%.As CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported, MATIC’s rise may stem from Web2 giant Meta's decision to launch a toolkit allowing users of social media platform Instagram to mint and sell Polygon-powered non-fungible tokens (NFT), or digital collectibles.

The unemployment rate rose to 3.7% versus expectations for 3.6%.The uptick in unemployment and a sizable decline in the household survey of 325,000 jobs encouraged at least one economist, Dartmouth’s Danny Blanchflower, that the hot jobs market was beginning to reverse, a good sign in the ongoing struggle to tame inflation: ""We are now in a position ... to expect the Fed to go into full reverse gear as the labor market is set to crash,"" Blanchflower tweeted.

514,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) seven-day performance is running cooler than usual following a previously reliable moving average crossover.The cryptocurrency has been trading in a narrow range since June, and finding signs of significant movement – up or down – has been challenging. A recently occurring moving average crossover is worth monitoring, however.On Oct. 28, BTC’s 10-period moving average crossed above its 50-period moving average. BTC’s price dating back to Jan. 1, 2015 shows this trend occurring 27 times over 2,862 trading days.Following each occurrence, BTC’s price increased by 3% on average for every seven days. BTC prices were about 10% higher on average for 30-day periods following the same signal.A comparison to all trading data over that period suggests that investors who have gone long BTC following that signal have slightly outperformed a buy-and-hold strategy.Whether this holds true for the most recent crossover is uncertain. Friday's prices would need to breach $21,216 to maintain the prior seven-day average. To align with past 30-day performance, prices would need to approach $22,615 by Nov. 28.The 10/50 moving average crossover has performed in line with the famed golden cross, though there have been far fewer opportunities to do so.A golden cross occurs when the 50-day moving average for an asset crosses above its 200-day moving average and often indicates a bullish trend in asset prices.The rationale behind examining a cross of the 10- and 50-day moving averages is simply to identify if a more commonly occurring signal is available.The graph below shows that the golden cross has occurred just six times since 2015, with average seven- and 30-day gains averaging 4.3% and 9.5%, respectively.Bitcoin’s declining volatility over the last 12 months is likely working against the signal, however. BTC’s ""average true range"" is 41% lower than the next most recent crossover, and over 70% lower than when the signal occurred in March and in October 2021.According to Kraken Intelligence’s latest Monthly Market Recap and Outlook report, BTC’s annualized volatility has reached its lowest level for 2022.Simply put, while the signal is likely positive, the reduced volatility has halted price movement.",2022/11/04

519,"All good things must come to an end, but in the case of the CoinDesk 20 – our list of the most relevant assets in the crypto markets – the end means a passing of the baton to something better and new: the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) family, a group of indices that serve as a benchmark for cryptocurrencies and the spiritual successor to the CD20.When we launched the CoinDesk 20 in the summer of 2020, the goal was to identify the assets that matter most to the market. At the time, bitcoin and ether were together the lion’s share of the market (they still are), and alternative coins flooded the market but only a few stood out. The CoinDesk 20 captured the 20 most important digital assets in the market based on a formula that weeded out flash-in-the-pan tokens and best represented what most of the market was looking at. Regularly, the CoinDesk 20’s total market cap was well above 90% of the overall market.Today, it’s a different world. More networks are showing they can provide viable cryptocurrencies, and specialization is becoming more apparent.On our end, CoinDesk also has more resources and technological capabilities than it did when launched the CoinDesk 20, thanks in large part to our acquisition of what is now CoinDesk Indices. Now we can provide incredible amounts of data and calculations to measure how the market is doing, and boil them down to a specific number: the CMI, an index of the most important coins out there, weighted by market capitalization.What’s more, CoinDesk Indices has also developed one of the most important projects out there for crypto asset managers: the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS). The DACS classifies 500 of the biggest cryptocurrencies into a three-tiered hierarchy of six sectors, 23 industry groups and 36 industries. Those six sectors are currency, smart contract platforms, decentralized finance, culture and entertainment, and computing and digitization.The CoinDesk 20 was a useful, informative tool for those following cryptocurrency markets, but with the advent of the CMI and the DACS CoinDesk now provides better, more robust ways to help everyone from crypto whales to crypto novices get a handle on the markets.This is just one of the many ways CoinDesk constantly iterates and improves what we offer the markets as this latest financial revolution takes shape.See also: CoinDesk Market Index Adds Convex, Serum, 12 Other Digital Assets",2022/11/04

The unemployment rate rose to 3.7% versus expectations for 3.6%After an initial dip of about $200, bitcoin (BTC) has bounced to its pre-report level, currently trading at $20,700. While the headline 261,000 jobs growth suggests the U.S. Federal Reserve has plenty more to do to battle inflation, at least one economist – Dartmouth Professor Danny Blanchflower – takes note of the rising unemployment rate and a sizable decline in the household survey of 325,000 jobs. ""We are now in a position ... to expect the Fed to go into full reverse gear as the labor market is set to crash,"" he tweeted. ""Rate cuts are coming,"" he added.Checking two metrics of particular concern for the Fed, average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in October versus expectations for 0.3%, suggesting a continuation of inflationary pressures. And the labor force participation rate – which the Fed would like to see rise as that might put a damper on wage growth – ticked down to 62.2%.“Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace of job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this week.On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided on a fourth consecutive 75 basis point interest rate increase in its continued effort to slow inflation by slowing the economy.However, both in its meeting statement and in Powell's post-meeting press conference, the Fed indicated it's mulling a slower pace of rate hikes, perhaps starting as soon the December FOMC meeting.Powell on Wednesday said he's more concerned with how high interest rates need to go rather than the pace of tightening, a shift from previously where talked about the Fed’s approach of “front-loading,” meaning that rates need to go higher faster.“While more hikes are on the way they are likely to be smaller from now on,” said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. “That said, there is nothing in there to suggest any desire to pivot to rate cuts later in 2023 – rates are more likely to be on hold through the rest of next year.“",2022/11/04
522,"The U.K. could make it difficult for crypto companies to advertise to clients within its borders if a new proposed bill is passed into law.On Thursday, lawmakers on the committee for the Financial Services and Markets (FSM) bill – which could also end up legally recognizing crypto as financial instruments – approved an amendment to a markets bill to regulate crypto ads and promotions.However, crypto advocates feel the rule may be too restrictive for a country that said it wants to support the digital asset industry.They worry crypto firms would have to jump through many hoops when trying to advertise to local customers, facing high costs from having to rely on an authorized entity to approve adverts.In January, the U.K. Treasury, the government's finance arm, said it planned to strengthen the rules governing crypto ads to improve consumer protection. The Treasury wants this measure in place to stop dangerous and fraudulent entities from reaching out to local customers.An amendment, which was accepted unanimously by committee lawmakers during Thursday’s reading of the bill, hopes to make crypto firms comply with the country's financial promotions rules. These rules would require any type of advertisement or invitation to the public to engage in an investment activity targeting consumers to be approved by an authorized entity, according to industry representatives.Even an advertisement that says “click here to exchange your assets” or “click here to start trading” is not allowed without approval from someone who is authorized, Diego Ballon Ossio, senior associate at London-based Clifford Chance, told CoinDesk in an interview.Crypto services are not recognized as regulated activities in the country, which means it would be almost impossible for these companies to approve their own ads.Read more: Bitcoin Exchanges Flood London's Metro With AdvertsAt present, a person or group from a company or a legal corporation can be designated as authorized entities for approving promotions. Authorized firms can also approve ads on behalf of other companies.In 2019, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) sent a warning letter to authorized approvers to make sure ads by unauthorized entities meet local regulatory standards before greenlighting them. The regulator has since said it wants to strengthen its rules to ensure that the firms which approve promotions have the relevant expertise to do so by February 2023.Currently, “no crypto firm is an authorized firm … so they can’t approve their advert,” said Mark Aruliah, senior policy adviser at Elliptic at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit in October.Because crypto is not recognized as a regulated activity right now, service providers don’t exactly have a means of getting authorized as an ad approver either.That means crypto firms would have to jump through more hoops and face more costs when trying to advertise to local customers because they’d have to rely on an authorized entity to approve their ads.In the U.K., crypto firms have to go through a complex process to register with the FCA, which oversees anti-money laundering compliance. The FCA registration allows crypto companies to serve clients in the U.K. but it does not give firms the go-ahead to authorize their own advertisements, Ossio said.“If somebody [a crypto firm] has gone through the very harsh process of getting registered, then they would still not be able to make financial promotions,” Ossio said.Read more: UK Financial Regulator to Limit Crypto Ads to Sophisticated, Wealthy InvestorsThe only exception is if firms have, for example, authorization for trading derivatives and just happen to also serve crypto, these companies can approve their own adverts, Ossio explained.In a Parliamentary debate last month City Minister Andrew Griffith, who proposed the amendment to his own bill, did reassure participants that the Treasury “will consult on its approach with industry and stakeholders ahead of using the powers, to ensure that the framework reflects the unique features, benefits and risks posed by crypto activities.” This consultation is set to occur in the coming weeks.If the new rule is passed into law without any changes, traditional financial firms would still be able to sign off on their own advertisements, but crypto firms will likely be at the mercy of authorized persons who don’t work for those firms. People who approve promotions will also have to check they are fair, clear and not misleading, said James Alleyne, a legal director at Kingsley Napley LLP, in a statement.This can be costly, according to Ian Taylor, executive director of the lobby group CryptoUK.Crypto firms could turn to lawyers to authorize their ads but “if something goes wrong, and then somebody sues because the advert isn't clear, there is a high risk premium attached to that,” Taylor said. “So they're going to charge a lot of money to crypto businesses to sign off on their advert. We don't even know if there's an appetite to do that.“Those who are not in crypto might also lack the necessary industry knowledge to know what they can and cannot approve, Ossio said.“And so, a registered crypto asset services business may have a problem which is that you could not publish financial promotions at all, and be restricted,” Ossio said.The Conservative government, now led by seemingly crypto-friendly Rishi Sunak, has said several times that it wants to make the country a hub for digital assets.The local crypto community is calling for changes to this measure to ensure the U.K. remains competitive in the sector. One suggestion is to extend the rule to foreign companies looking to enter the market. Currently, firms not registered in the U.K. can reach out to serve clients based there because there are no rules to stop them from doing so.“My hope is that ... the restriction of financial promotions comes in so then overseas persons can't come in until they have somebody like a lawyer to prove it. So investors in the U.K. are kept safe,” said Aruliah of Elliptic.U.K. crypto firms should be able to approve their own adverts, otherwise, there is no real incentive to be in the country over other jurisdictions like the European Union, Aruliah said.The EU recently finalized markets in crypto assets legislation – its wide ranging bill on crypto, which has a heavy focus on stablecoins.Though the U.K. government has said that it wants to be a crypto hub, the FCA has admitted it had a more critical view of crypto in the past. Should lawmakers give the FCA greater authorities through its FSM bill, what happens to crypto companies will depend on this more skeptical regulator. The FCA has already said it plans on publishing the final rules on the promotion of relevant crypto assets once it gets these powers, it said in August.“These rules are likely to follow the same approach as those for other high-risk investments,” the FCA said in August. “Crypto remains high risk so people need to be prepared to lose all their money if they choose to invest in crypto assets.”CryptoUK has been proposing solutions to the Treasury to ensure U.K. crypto firms are not disadvantaged by the promotions amendment.“So where we're focused on is [telling] Treasury you need to change this authorized persons regime to perhaps include firms that have an e-money license or are on the money laundering regime,” CryptoUK’s Taylor said.The FSM bill is still being debated in parliament.Read more: UK Powers to Regulate Crypto Ads Approved by Lawmaker Committee",2022/11/04
523,"The advance in scaling system Polygon's native cryptocurrency MATIC has accelerated in the wake of positive news and bullish chart patterns.MATIC has rallied 30% in two days, reaching a six-month high of $1.15 on Friday, according to CoinDesk data. The climb has lifted the cryptocurrency's cumulative gain since the end of June to 270%.The latest leg higher could be attributed to Web2 giant Meta's decision to launch a toolkit allowing users of social media platform Instagram to mint and sell Polygon-powered non-fungible tokens (NFT), or digital collectibles. Polygon is the first partner that Meta has chosen for the new feature.""Creators will soon be able to make their own digital collectibles on Instagram and sell them to fans, both on and off Instagram,"" Meta announced Wednesday. ""They’ll have an end-to-end toolkit – from creation (starting on the Polygon blockchain) and showcasing to selling.""On the same day, investment banking giant JPMorgan successfully executed its first decentralized finance trade over Polygon.MATIC's rally since then suggests that despite lingering concerns about the global economy, investors are ready to snap up coins with positive fundamental developments that promise increased use cases.The investor preference for news-driven trading is also evident from Thursday's 60% surge in AR, the native coin of the decentralized storage system Arweave after Meta said it would utilize the Web3 platform to archive digital collectibles.According to Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, MATIC's rally could have legs.""Polygon's MATIC could be a core long position here as Meta (Facebook) is serious about luring TikTok influencers away and becoming more active on its Instagram platform,"" Thielen said. ""Pledging to take zero commission on sales – contrary to Apple's 30% cut on all NFT sales on the App store – is a key selling point.""Meta said it won't charge fees to create or sell NFTs until 2024. However, 30% sales deductions will be applicable for the store fees. A core long position refers to a primary long-term bet that satisfies both fundamental and technical research criteria.""The Meta announcement has brought attention to MATIC and [AR], and traders seem to be pairing long positions in these coins with short [sell] positions in perpetual futures tied to bitcoin,"" said Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds.""Taking U.S. dollar exposure out of the trade seems to be the best thing to do right now,"" he said, drawing attention to the surging MATIC-BTC ratio, which has jumped to the highest point since January on Binance.The MATIC/USD daily price chart shows the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) has crossed above the 200-day SMA, confirming what chart analysts call a golden crossover.The pattern indicates the recent average price is higher than the long-term average price, a positive signal indicating the progression of an uptrend.MATIC has toppled resistance at $1.055 (the Aug. 14 high), having breached a downtrend line last month. The next resistance is lined up at $1.24, the Feb. 24 low.The dollar amount locked in futures tied to MATIC, also known as open interest, has nearly doubled from $209 million to $415 million in 24 hours, according to data source coinglass.com.An increased open interest implies an influx of new money into the market.

524,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Macroeconomic uncertainty reigns but bitcoin continued to hold tight comfortably above $20K. DOGE plunged late on Thursday after news that Twitter was halting work on its crypto wallet project.Insights: Alamedia Research and crypto exchange FTX are bound together, a recent Alameda document underlines.Bitcoin Sails Along; DOGE Plummets LateBy James RubinThe global economy saw more stormy weather on Thursday as the U.S. Labor Department announced a small dip in weekly jobless claims just a few hours after the Bank of England boosted its interest rate by a jumbo-sized 75 basis points, matching recent U.S. hikes.The two unrelated events underscored the difficulties central banks are facing in cooling the still hot job market and stemming inflation, and they sent equities downward.However, bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, continued to sail along at roughly the same levels they’ve maintained for much of the past two weeks. BTC was holding steady at about $20,200, while ETH continued to hover over $1,500 – both up a few smidgens during the past 24 hours. Crypto investors have recently been undeterred by a raft of evidence that conditions are still not ready to settle down.“Hawkish monetary policy and macroeconomic uncertainty rage on,” CoinDesk crypto markets analyst Glenn Williams wrote. “But crypto investors ultimately have little else on their mind than cost basis.”A number major tokens spent much of the day trading solidly in the green, with MATIC and LRC recently up nearly 11% and 7%, respectively. But popular meme coin DOGE plunged more than 9% following a report that Twitter's mercurial new owner, Elon Musk, was halting work on the social media platform's crypto wallet. The token spiked 16% last week as Musk, an avid DOGE supporter, neared completion of his $44 billion deal. Musk's activities and utterances have consistently influenced DOGE's price.The job market may soon offer more concrete evidence that central bank measures to tame rising prices are working.

Concerns about conflicts of interest were rising because Alameda had the tripartite role as a market maker, investor and trader.Many FTX users didn’t like that SBF, and by virtue FTX, led the firms as they might find themselves lining the pockets of Alameda as they traded a new token it was market making or, perhaps worse, being on the other side of a trade against Alameda.A firewall was put in place, and the SBF-led empire tried to make Alameda a separate institution from FTX.The biggest assetBut recently, CoinDesk came into possession of an internal Alameda document that outlined its balance sheet.And the biggest assets on the books? FTX’s FTT token.This makes the two firms bound to each other.FTT’s token officially gives exchange users discounts on trading fees if they stake it. But, practically, it operates as something akin to stock. In good times, FTT’s token rises; in bad times, it declines. Apropos, whenever bad news about Binance hits the newswires, its eponymous token, BNB, declines.So now, approximately $5.2 billion of Alameda’s net worth of $14.6 billion is tied up in “unlocked FTT” and “FTT collateral.”If, for some reason, FTX faces a crisis, or a fierce competitor, Alameda risks becoming less liquid. If there’s a massive market drawdown, the contagion between a crippled FTX and Alameda would create a catastrophe that would make Three Arrows Capital’s “Lehman moment” look like a monthly cyclical correction.Likewise, there’s still a problematic relationship between FTX and Alameda. Market manipulation is on everyone’s mind, which is why in TradFi such an arrangement would not be allowed.The dynamic would be similar in theory to the New York Stock Exchange and market-maker goliath Citadel Securities having the same parent, with NYSE and its executives emphasizing stocks being market made by Citadel. Such ingredients would be ripe for a congressional inquiry. But these types of relationships don’t happen because TradFi market makers are bound by registration requirements and some form of transparency.There’s $41 million of SOL also on Alameda’s books, as Solana was an investment by FTX and a made market by Alameda. Solana has fallen out of favor with traders given its frequent ""breakdowns"" and the questionable size of its development community. When Alameda and FTX were pushing this token throughout the summer of 2021, did they know something that retail did not?Occasionally, over-the-counter deals Alameda is involved in, such as with Reef Finance, sometimes go wrong and retail traders are left to punt around in the shadows of the elites.Like many crypto companies, Alameda exists as a collection of corporate entities spanning multiple countries from the Far East to Delaware.

This new proposal could make it even more restrictive for the miners to operate in the province.Read more: Why Crypto Miners Are Expanding Beyond Quebec Hydro-Quebec's plan called for the Regie de l'energie, or Canada Energy Regulator, to suspend the allocation of a 270 megawatts (MW) already planned for the industry.

""Under this process, approximately 270 MW were slated to be dedicated to cryptographic use over the short term, but the allocation of that amount of capacity to this use would increase pressure on current balances,"" the statement added.The new proposal also said that it anticipates an increase of 25 terawatt hours (TWh) or 14% in Quebec’s electricity demand over the 2022–2032 period.Some of the miners that are currently operating in Quebec include Bitfarms (BITF), Hive Blockchain (HIVE) and Argo Blockchain (ARBK).Bitfarms, which invested C$350 million in Québec since its inception and currently employs over 100 employees, said that its power agreement remains in place with Hydro-Québec.

As of Sept. 30, the fair value of Block's bitcoin investment was $156 million based on “observable market prices,” which was $45 million greater than the carrying value of the investment after impairment charges, the company noted.Shares of Block jumped 14% in post-market trading Thursday.Block posted $1.57 billion in overall gross profit for the quarter, up from $1.47 billion in the second quarter.

530,"Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) cut its third-quarter losses by 50% to $545 million from $1.1 billion in the second quarter, the company reported Thursday, as the company reined in costs and cut workers, and also increased its interest income.However, its transaction revenue continued to be significantly impacted by macroeconomic and crypto market headwinds, which it expects to continue into 2023, as well as trading volume moving offshore, the company said in its shareholder letter.Transaction revenue was $366 million, down 44% from Q2, driven by lower trading volume. Among the factors Coinbase cited for this decline was that “trading volume has been shifting away from the U.S., where our business is concentrated.” It noted that this shift is partly due to the “perception of uncertainty” that some digital asset issuers may have about the U.S. regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.Meanwhile, subscription and services revenue increased 43% sequentially to $211 million, driven by higher interest income. Rising interest income had been seen by some analysts as a potential bright spot for Coinbase given rising short-term rates. Total operating expenses were $1.1 billion, down 38% versus Q2.Overall net revenue of $576 million was shy of the FactSet analyst consensus estimate of $646 million and down from $803 million in Q2. The company ended Q3 with $5.6 billion in cash, in addition to $483 million in crypto assets, which the company believes “puts us in a strong position to manage through the crypto winter.”For 2022, Coinbase said it remains ""cautiously optimistic"" that it will operate within the $500 million adjusted EBITDA loss guardrail that it previously shared, based on the assumption that crypto prices do not deteriorate significantly and that customer behaviors don't change. ""For 2023, we’re preparing with a conservative bias and assuming that the current macroeconomic headwinds will persist and possibly intensify,"" Coinbase concluded.Coinbase shares rose about 3.8% to $57.90 in after-hours trading on Thursday after falling 8% during the day's trading. Coinbase shares are down more than 75% this year, compared to bitcoin’s roughly 56% decline. Coinbase’s stock has plummeted this year with the crypto and equity market rout leading to a slowdown in retail trading. In response, the crypto exchange slashed around 1,100 jobs in June and focused on controlling costs.On Coinbase's earnings conference call, management expressed optimism in their platform, but was cautious about the macro environment. Still, CEO Brian Armstrong struck an optimistic note.""In the down markets, you get to focus on building,"" Armstrong said, adding that  innovation is still occurring and that many institutions continue to dabble in the sector and prep for when macroeconomic conditions improve.Armstrong also said he expects USDC to be the de-facto CBDC in the U.S. The company said it benefitted from being engaged in the USDC ecosytem during the third quarter, according to its statement. Coinbase entered into agreements with the issuer of USDC, pursuant to which Coinbase shares any revenue generated from USDC reserves pro rata based on the amount of USDC distributed by each respective party along with the amount of USDC held on each respective party’s platform, the statement noted.During the quarter, Coinbase announced a partnership with BlackRock to allow customers of the giant asset manager to trade crypto through the exchange, and also partnered with Google to accept crypto payments for cloud services.UPDATE (Nov. 3, 20:46 UTC): Updated COIN's share price movement.UPDATE (Nov. 3, 21:31 UTC): Updated with background and additional information throughout.UPDATE (Nov. 3, 22:48 UTC): Updates to include commentary from conference call, USDC engagement, and share price.",2022/11/03
531,"Hawkish monetary policy and macroeconomic uncertainty rage on.But crypto investors ultimately have little else on their mind than cost basis. On a quiet trading day that saw bitcoin and ether sink slightly, and the Bank of England deliver the latest, global interest rate body blow – its highest increase in 33 years – investors continued to focus almost exclusively on how much they paid for an asset.To be sure, macro data remains important as cryptocurrencies react increasingly to the same stimuli that have affected other assets for decades. Jobs and productivity reports, energy prices and Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, for example, have all jarred markets over the past year.However, crypto investors have grown increasingly adept at pricing in such events and others, and are less likely to be caught off guard, which accounts for bitcoin’s lack of major movement in recent months.On Thursday, bitcoin was trading at almost exactly the same mark it held in mid-June, undisturbed by the Federal Reserve’s fourth consecutive jumbo rate increase, GDP declines, hawkish remarks from Chair Jerome Powell and socio-political turmoil.Through four consecutive 75 basis point rate increases, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has formed a base that, depending on the week, has hovered over $19,000 or $20,000 since mid-June. This broad threshold will likely serve as support moving forward.The world turns but the asset often criticized for its volatility has not – or certainly not as much as leading equity indexes this year.Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) is currently 56, which is only slightly above neutral, and bitcoin’s price is within 2% of its 20-day moving average.Much of the pain from 2022’s price declines appears to have already flushed through the market.Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) graphic highlights a spike in BTC acquired near the $20,000 price point.This trend highlights a resetting of cost basis as bitcoin holders who purchased at higher levels exited their positions to alleviate financial distress.By contrast, newer investors entered into long positions between $19,000 and $21,000 but have not been impacted to the same extent.This trend also coincides nicely with the Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) tool, indicating high volume nodes at $19,200 and $20,300.

532,"The U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) member Frederick Cannon said Thursday he supports recording companies’ crypto gains and losses as part of their net income, according to a report in Bloomberg.This means that these gains and losses would directly hit these companies’ earnings. The other choice would be to have companies record the swings in the value of their crypto holdings in “other comprehensive income,” which wouldn’t impact earnings.Last month, FASB signaled its support for fair value accounting for cryptocurrency over the current system of treating them as intangible assets, meaning any declines in value must be permanently recorded as non-cash impairments, while gains are only recorded when the assets have been sold. Fair value accounting means that any crypto losses or gains would be reported immediately, as they would for other traditional financial assets.Companies that hold large amounts of bitcoin on their balance sheets such as MicroStrategy (MSTR) have been pushing FASB to adopt fair value accounting for crypto, saying it would encourage institutional adoption of digital assets.“My bias is just to push [cryptocurrencies] through income and make it simple,” Bloomberg quoted Cannon as saying at a securities industry accounting conference. “But that’s just me.”Cannon is one of seven FASB board members.

533,"Notoriously volatile bitcoin slid but stayed relatively stable on Thursday as traditional markets fell on news of the Bank of England’s biggest rate hike in 33 years and the prior day’s move by the U.S. Federal Reserve.Some crypto analysts think the $20,000 price level for bitcoin (BTC), which for weeks had served as a price ceiling, now is acting more like a floor.“Bitcoin at the $20,000 level also has a lot of technical support from miners and institutional buyers, who view that level as psychologically important,” said Michael Safai, managing partner of crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital.Bitcoin was trading around $20,200, down 2.1% in the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization stayed above the $20,000 level for the 10th consecutive day, after previously failing below the critical price mark for 18 straight days.The CoinDesk Market Index rose 1.3%. Ether (ETH) slid 4.4% to $1,540 as of press time. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 0.6%.Bitcoin's relative stability reflects the “slow yet tangible decoupling from stocks” in recent weeks, according to Safai.BTC’s support at the $20,000 level “should show markets how confident long-term holders remain,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, wrote in a note on Thursday.The U.S. dollar got a boost in foreign-exchange markets from the Fed’s rate hike and Chair Jerome Powell’s speech suggesting more interest rate hikes likely are ahead. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield was up to 4.68%, the highest since July 2007.Crypto data and analysis firm IntoTheBlock’s data shows the 30-day correlation between the BTC price and U.S. Dollar Index dropped to -0.77, the most deeply inverse relationship in a month and a half.As interest rates rise, Safai said, “shorter-maturity U.S. government bonds returning anywhere from 4%-5% at nearly zero risk will look good against almost any other asset, including crypto which still has its share of macro sensitivity.”Now all eyes are on Friday’s U.S. jobs report, with Powell indicating the labor market’s strength is a key metric the Fed is closely monitoring.Economists surveyed by FactSet estimate the U.S. economy probably added 200,000 jobs in October, slowing from the 263,000 added in September but still a robust pace.“There could be some increased sensitivity to the jobs report tomorrow if it’s not great,” said Safai.",2022/11/03
534,"COCORNA, Colombia – At the end of September, a group of crypto and climate nerds descended on Colombia’s mountainous rainforests to discuss how they can work together to save the planet. It was, to say the least, an event to remember; complete with hydrotherapy, a sharing circle, getting lost in the woods in the middle of an evening storm, nightly bonfires, hints of infighting and a sense of honesty rare to crypto conferences of today.The event was organized by the Blockchain Infrastructure Carbon Offsetting Working Group (BICOWG), which aims to support crypto projects with a climate focus. Members of the working group were at the retreat, including representatives of event sponsor Regen Network, a layer 1 blockchain company that is building a marketplace for tokenized natural assets.Also present among the diverse 50-odd participants were representatives from major layer 1s including Solana, Filecoin, Ripple and Hedera Hashgraph; the Global Blockchain Business Council industry association; Verra, the world’s largest voluntary carbon offsets issuer; and a number of different crypto-climate projects big and small, old and new. There was even a Chinese internet-of-things (IoT) firm.The inaugural BICOWG retreat took place at Tierra de Agua, an eco-hotel near Cocorna, about an hour southeast of Medellin. The significance of the venue was not lost on the retreat participants. Running through the hotel is a stream that ends in the Samana River, one of the tributaries of the Magdalena River, which traverses most of Colombia from the Andes to the Atlantic, irrigating crops and livelihoods along the way. The Samana is the last free-flowing river in the Antioquia region of Colombia because others have been dammed to harvest hydropower.The three days were jam-packed with activities, some of which, upon description, will sound like the kind of tech-hippy antics for which WeWork’s Adam Neumann was ridiculed.There was a hydrotherapy session, when attendees sat under an icy waterfall in their bathing suits, then rubbed themselves with guava juice (for exfoliation) before entering a steam bath.One afternoon some 30 or so of us headed for a hike to a nearby Indigenous community. We entered the bamboo and clay houses of members of the Wiwa tribe, who still live in a traditional way. Under candlelight, the Wiwa explained the importance of balance between the energy of the north (symbolized by the eagle) and the south (represented by the condor). Between these poles, they believe, is the hummingbird, in perfect balance.Most of the activities were held in a large room at the hotel with a high, conical ceiling and no walls. A hummingbird happened to be nesting right in front of the speaker’s area, in a hanging lamp shade, quite a coincidence given the visit with the Wiwa tribe. The symbolism was not lost on the attendees, and many pointed it out throughout the retreat.Each of the three nights the group gathered around a bonfire, and the retreat closed with a sharing circle, at which each of the 50 participants spoke about their takeaways from the experience.As New Age-y as some of these activities seem, the end result was that it drew closer this community of people genuinely interested in climate-positive action. The group, many of whom were initially strangers, worked productively together to come out of the retreat with solid action items.The term “ReFi” for “regenerative finance,” is envisioned as the antidote to “degenerative finance,” the type of economic system we are in today, which many at the retreat claim is leeching the blood out of the planet and its people. Regenerative finance is building economic models that actually resuscitate the natural environment and human communities.“It’s a meme,” explained Antonio Paglino, who leads ReFi Barrichara, another region of Colombia that is currently in the early stages of being “regenerated” through a collaboration between the local community and crypto. “Next year we might be using another term” but the mission will be the same, he said.I asked Jahed Momand, co-founder and general partner at climate-focused venture capital firm Cerulean Ventures, if working on climate-positive solutions makes him more hopeful about the future of the world. He said, “Absolutely not” with the resoluteness that one declines their least favorite food. The world will fundamentally change for the worse as a result of the climate catastrophe, it’s the degree that they are fighting for, he said.It was clear to me that the attendees were quite realistic about their goals and how they could achieve them.The idea of regenerative finance is fascinating. It brings together a holistic approach that takes into account social, economic and political aspects of how blockchains can build markets that make the world a better place, instead of unleashing crypto-based financial freedom on the masses and hoping everything works itself out.The main focus of the retreat was to get all the different projects talking to each other about interoperability and how to avoid duplicate efforts.Perhaps due to this focus, close to zero shilling of projects happened during the three-day event, a remarkable achievement within the crypto community. One of the participants pointed out later that this is exactly what set this group apart – they weren’t after the spotlight or money.The phrase “getting our house in order” was repeated at several of the workshop presentations as people emphasized that internal divisions must be ironed out before the ReFi movement is ready to start promoting itself on the world stage. As an outsider, it was hard to get a glimpse of the divisions among this small group but the signs were there. Many expressed their surprise that arguments hadn’t broken out.At the end of the retreat, several working groups were formed, split along different categories of action (social, technical, structural, etc.) to continue the process of achieving true interoperability. As several of the participants noted at the sharing circle, “the proof is in the pudding,” and the success of the event will be judged by whether anything concrete comes out of it.Through the workshops, conversations swirled around the subject of ego; whether it can or should be mitigated to pursue interoperability. An interesting division appeared on the second night during a Jeffersonian dinner, at which each table had to discuss a topic and take into account everyone’s thoughts.My table went pretty deep down a philosophical rabbit hole, discussing how societies construct egos, how people’s egos are a defense mechanism, and how all of this is detrimental to collaboration and achieving harmony etc. By contrast, the table right next to ours concluded that ego should not be mitigated but harnessed to achieve greater goals.Also during that Jeffersonian dinner, Casson Trenor, an environmental activist, called out the movement’s fixation with carbon offsets. Perhaps because these are the easiest thing out of which to make tokenized markets, given that carbon markets are already fairly developed, the ReFi movement has focused a lot on carbon credits. Other “nature-backed assets” are in the works, but few have materialized yet.After two days of talking about tokenized markets for carbon offsets, with several presentations on the topic, Trenor asked, exasperatedly, “Why are we still talking about carbon offsets? We need emission reductions, now,” surprising the audience. Over the next few days presenters and attendees would almost defensively say in their speeches that they were thinking about other tokenized assets as well – which wasn’t exactly Trenor’s point.The noncarbon-obsessed participants seemed happy to be included in the conversation and learn from people who have been part of the movement for years. “It’s been great to be a part of this as someone who is working on a different aspect of sustainability,” said Gjermund Garaba, chief technology officer at Empower, a blockchain platform for tracing plastic collection and recycling.Towards the end of Day One, Daniel Hwang, formerly with f2pool and stakefish and a leading member of BICOWG, hosted a fireside chat with Benoît Clement, chief of financial innovation at Verra. Clement’s presence at the conference was a big deal – many of these crypto projects have based their existence on the fact that voluntary carbon markets are inadequate and lack transparency.Hwang asked hardball questions and Clement answered diplomatically. Verra is exploring the potential to collaborate with Web3 projects and has asked for feedback on how to approach third-party tokenization. However, so far “a lot of action has been taken [by crypto projects tokenizing carbon credits] without all the t’s being crossed and i’s being dotted,” he said.Crypto’s inherent anonymity might be problematic for a marketplace that handles millions of dollars from credited, regulated institutions. “Maybe when there’s hundreds of millions of dollars in money going through a market it’s good to know who that money is coming from” as well as who retires carbon credits, Clement said. Another important question is defining when speculative investment is warranted and good for projects and investors, he pointed out.Despite the talk of interoperability, some attendees banded together to sign a 12-page statement that the voluntary carbon marketplace should not, in its efforts to accommodate Web3, actually slow down innovation.All that being said, there was a certain insularity to the group and, as a complete outsider normally focused on an industry that many of the attendees find somewhat abhorrent (bitcoin mining), I found it hard to break in. It was my impression that many formed real, human bonds during the three days.By its own admission, this group is not ready to go public, and the language they use and the narrative they promote needs to be refined for a broader audience. Many of the discussions did feel like the terse echo bubbles that the world dislikes about crypto.How some of their projects will be taken by the wider world remains to be seen. Their ideas do not at first instance match well with the majority of investors, funds and asset managers. The group seemed ambivalent as to whether it wants to attract the attention and support of the big powers of the world, or whether it wants to work independently of them. Still, some of the attendees are headed to COP27, the United Nations’ biggest climate conference.

The cumulative total for crypto hacks in 2022 is now at least $2.98 billion, already more than double the amount stolen through exploits in 2021, according to blockchain security firm Peckshield.Peckshield released those figures on Halloween night, giving credence to the term “Hacktober” some industry participants have taken to using. Not a week has gone by without some exploit in crypto making the news. Peckshield estimated there were at least 44 exploits involving some 53 protocols in October.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.November, too, is already off to a rocky start. Wednesday, Deribit closed customer withdrawals from the derivative exchange so it could patch a bug in its hot wallet that led to a loss of $28 million in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and stablecoin USDC. Then Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Solend announced a $1 million exploit. Meanwhile, a new Lightning Network bug has been discovered that can cause transactions to fail on the Bitcoin scaling and payments layer.That some $100 million of funds stolen in October have so far been returned is cold comfort. Crypto has become a den of liars, thieves and exploiters – in a way that has may have permanently stained the industry's reputation. Also of little relief is the fact that crypto, once thought to be the den of illicit dark net behavior, is just a fraction of global crime. That may be because open, verifiable blockchains are bad places to do bad things. But even with just a small percentage of total crypto transactions being tied to criminal behavior, hacks will continue to tarnish the industry's reputation.Apart from scaring potential participants, hacks have real consequences for how authorities will regulate the industry. The $625 million Ronin bridge exploit in March, the second-most lucrative month in 2022 for hackers, was thought to have been perpetrated by North Korean keyboard warriors and eventually led to the sanctioning of the Ethereum-based crypto mixer Tornado Cash by the U.S. Treasury Department.Exploits come in all shapes and sizes. Bridges, the communication portals between different blockchains that often require users to park collateral before getting on, seem like particularly vulnerable targets. It’s clear today that crypto needs more resilient infrastructure if the “multi-chain” world will ever become a reality.Some schemes are exploits of crypto and DeFi’s fundamental design. In 2020, amid the rise of DeFi, the industry saw the rise of the “flash loan” attack. Instead of exploiting buggy code, flash loans are actually a desirable (for some) financial mechanism that allows people to borrow significant amounts of crypto and pay back the loan within a single block – sometimes manipulated so that users can walk away with the money without having paid more than a few transaction fees.Another increasing area of concern are protocols that use blockchain oracles to feed them real-world data. Last month, a hacker manipulated price feeds to take out a $116 million loan on Mango Markets, draining the protocol’s liquidity. That attack, one of three that occurred on Oct. 12, seems to have been replicated again with Wednesday’s Solend breach.See also: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error | OpinionIt’s hard to stop attacks that seem to rely on DeFi’s core functions and promise: permissionless transactions. This is an echo of crypto’s long-running problem with rug pulls, which at one time seemed to be the source of most stolen funds. According to a report by the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute initially published in early 2022 and recently updated, some 97% of token listings were connected to “malicious” activity.Experts have criticized that data, which analyzed 27,000 tokens, saying that not every low-effort phishing or pyramid scheme has takers. Some, like Mark Zeller, vice president of the DeFi committee at L'Adan, a French digital asset industry group, said crypto users know the risks when they decide to get involved. That’s likely the case for people who know how to bridge crypto across blockchains or provision liquidity in decentralized money markets.But that argument is less convincing for crypto platforms like lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital which advertised to the masses and had user experiences similar to legitimate banking and trading apps. DeFi, too, is moving to professionalize and polish its on-ramps. Maybe it can clear out the bugs.",2022/11/03
536,"Eurozone and U.K. inflation rates are at record, double-digit highs, prompting some governments to begin warming up to bitcoin. One evangelist is meeting with officials to accelerate the process.Most people already know El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender in September of last year. The Central African Republic followed suit this past April. But less publicized is that some elected officials in places like the U.K. and Portugal are increasingly taking a shine to bitcoin.Samson Mow spent half a decade as chief strategy officer of Blockstream, the blockchain infrastructure company started by Bitcoin pioneer Adam Back. It was there that Mow advised El Salvador President Nayib Bukele on the country’s $1 billion bond backed by bitcoin.Now, Mow is CEO of Bitcoin technology startup Jan3 (the Bitcoin blockchain launched on Jan. 3, 2009), and he has made it his mission to educate other governments on Bitcoin.Based on conversations he has had with politicians, Mow said “hyperbitcoinization” – or the point where Bitcoin becomes the world’s dominant monetary system – is only a few years away.“If your criteria [for hypberbitcoinization] is every country in the world, it might take 20 or 30 years. But if you're talking about a good number of countries; let's say North America, Europe and a number of countries in Latin America and Africa, I think it's definitely possible around 2030,” Mow told CoinDesk in an interview.Read more: Ex-Blockstream Exec Samson Mow Raises $21M for Bitcoin Startup JAN3Typically, countries in Africa, Asia, Oceania, Latin America and the Caribbean – the Global South – are the ones prone to debilitating socio-economic woes including political instability and hyperinflation. These conditions often make Global South citizens significantly more receptive to Bitcoin and its native currency.“If you're born in the Global South, where you've seen rapid inflation or your parents have seen rapid inflation or hyperinflation where your currency can massively devalue and you're going to need a wheelbarrow to truck it around, then you get Bitcoin much quicker,” Mow said. “You just have an easier route to understanding Bitcoin versus someone born in Canada or the U.S. But things are changing.”Mow, a Canadian, explained how some conditions in the Global North (North America, Europe and Australasia) seem to be converging with conditions in the Global South. Canada narrowly escaped double-digit inflation this past summer, but America’s northern neighbor made headlines earlier in the year when the Canadian government told banks to freeze accounts belonging to citizens who donated to the Canadian trucker protests.Read more: Vitalik Buterin Calls Canada's Use of Banks to Stifle Protestors 'Dangerous'“If you're a protester and you disagree with the government’s stance on something, your bank account can be frozen for lawful behavior. So that should really drive people to move to bitcoin, move to self-sovereign money that someone else cannot just turn off,” said Mow.Meanwhile, other political leaders are pushing for a more libertarian approach to governance and Mow is knocking on their doors. He said he had an intriguing fireside chat with U.K. Member of Parliament Lisa Cameron at the U.K. Bitcoin Conference last week, for example.More substantially, Mow has developed a relationship with Miguel Albuquerque, president of Madeira, a Portuguese autonomous region off the coast of North Africa that is becoming known as the “Bitcoin Beach of Portugal.” President Albuquerque has openly embraced bitcoin, so much so there were erroneous reports that Madeira had declared bitcoin its legal tender. Mow now sits on the board of the Regional Forum of Economic Education (Forum Regional Educação Econômica – F.R.E.E. Madeira), an initiative designed to make Madeira a global technological hub, with an emphasis on bitcoin.Mow said he’s also working with Prospera, a special economic zone in Honduras that made bitcoin legal tender.“It's effectively a free, private city,” Mow explained of Prospera. “They're on the island of Roatan.”Closer to the U.S., Mow said, “We’re engaged with Senator Indira Kempis. She's pushing for bitcoin adoption in Mexico.”It seems the list of governments embracing bitcoin or interested in making it legal tender is not only growing but becoming more diverse, especially as jurisdictions in both the Global North and South become better educated on the topic.“It's all about education,” Mow explained. “We were trying to get some meetings in South Korea a few months back, but the climate was not great because of Terra’s collapse. There's still a great deal of conflation between bitcoin and crypto. That's another area we're working to educate people on, which is, bitcoin is not crypto. There's bitcoin, there's crypto and then there are stablecoins, three distinct categories.”There’s also a fourth category – central bank digital currencies (CBDC). These are simply digital currencies issued by a country’s central bank. Many governments from both sides of the north-south divide have already launched projects to implement CBDCs into their monetary systems. However, Mow is skeptical.Read more: China's CBDC Transactions Reach $14B as Uptake Slows: Report“The problem is governments are really bad at thinking about system design,” he warned. “Either it's going to take 20 or 30 years for a proper transition, or it's just going to fall flat. CBDCs are just conceptualized and theory-crafted in a complete vacuum. They'll never function properly. There's probably hundreds of things that will go wrong in the implementation of a CBDC.”",2022/11/03
537,"Bitcoin miner Iris Energy (IREN) may be able to continue operating without the burden of expensive debt, Compass Point analyst Chase White told clients in a research note Thursday.White's comments come after Iris earlier this week said some of its mining equipment – owned by special-purpose vehicles – isn't producing enough cash to meet financing obligations. Additionally, Iris said that the equipment has a market value ""well below the principal amount of the relevant loans"" and that it is in talks with the lender.White thinks negotiations may aid the company's financial position.“Given the depressed pricing for mining rigs in the market (recent pricing has been in the $15/TH range for similar machines), we believe the smartest choice for the lenders is to voluntarily restructure the debt to reduce monthly debt service payments, for instance, by extending the maturity of the loans,” White wrote, referring to terahash, a measure of computing power.“Otherwise, because there is no recourse to IREN, the company can just send the rigs back to the lenders and use its enhanced liquidity position to purchase new machines at a lower implied price, making the transaction net accretive,” he added.Compass Point rates the stock at buy with a $8.50 price target. The shares were recently down 6% to $2.70.Read more: Bitcoin Miner Iris Energy Says Some Machines Aren't Covering Financing Costs",2022/11/03

541,"Bitcoin (BTC) has plunged 70% in value since hitting a peak of $69,000 in November of last year.The ongoing bear market may appear more brutal than previous ones considering several industry heavyweights like Terra, Three Arrows Capital and Celsius Network have buckled under the weight of the market crash. Yet, there is a silver lining.According to data provider CryptoCompare, both small and large investors have consistently bought the cryptocurrency on the dips, contradicting the continued selling seen during previous bear markets dated November 2013 to December 2014 and December 2017 to December 2018. Both bear markets saw bitcoin plunge more than 80% from record highs.""As opposed to the last bear market, where all holders across different wallet sizes were panic-selling, in this bear market we have seen a consistent accumulation in almost all accounts,"" CryptoCompare's quarterly report released on Thursday said.""Accounts above 10,000 bitcoins have seen a fair increase which is likely due to increased institutional adoption,"" CryptoCompare added.Per data sourced from blockchain analytics firm Santiment, nine new addresses owning 10,000 BTC to 100,000 BTC have been created since Sept. 20. These addresses have snapped up 190,000 BTC (worth $3.8 billion) in seven weeks.Investors and analysts widely use wallets or address-based metrics to gauge changes in demand and supply. On-chain data has its limitations and inferring definite conclusions about market activity from the same is challenging. For example, a user/exchange can control multiple addresses. In other words, every new address does not represent a new investor. Crypto exchanges often hold user coins in multiple addresses.Another positive takeaway from the latest market swoon is the decline in bitcoin's volatility.The annualized realized volatility has averaged 63% in the past 12 months. That's lower than the average of 79% seen during the previous bear market, according to CryptoCompare.Realized volatility measures daily changes in the price of a security over a particular period of time. Its backward-looking and different from implied volatility, an options market gauge representing traders' expectations for price turbulence in coming days, weeks, or months.If that's not enough, bitcoin's 20-day realized volatility recently matched Wall Street's tech-heavy index Nasdaq, the first such instance since 2020, per data sourced from charting platform TradingView.Skeptics have long criticized bitcoin for being too volatile to be a good store of value. So, a continued decline in price turbulence would be a welcome development.""Bitcoin's volatility has been steadily stabilizing in a bounded range compared to the last bear market. While this may suggest cryptocurrencies are maturing as an asset class, such patterns also typically precede a large spike in volatility – such as in November 2017,"" CryptoCompare noted.Early this week, Arcane Research and crypto services provider Matrixport told clients to buy straddles to capture returns from a potential volatility explosion.",2022/11/03
542,"New U.K. laws to restrict crypto ads and outlaw the provision of services by unauthorized operators were passed in a committee of the House of Commons Thursday without opposition or further debate.The measures, now formally included in the government’s Financial Services and Markets Bill, add to those agreed upon last week by the Bill Committee, despite industry concerns the measure could make it harder to get ads approved.In April, Rishi Sunak – at the time finance minister, now prime minister – said he wanted to make the country a crypto hub, and the government has pressed on with its regulatory agenda despite political turbulence that saw first Boris Johnson and then Liz Truss stepping down as leader.On Oct. 25, minister Andrew Griffith told lawmakers the measure gave him the powers for “regulating a broader set of crypto activities beyond stablecoins,” citing “activities relating to the trading and investment of crypto assets such as bitcoin and [ether].”The original draft of the bill focused on the use of stablecoins – a means of payment tied to assets such as the British pound. For reasons of legislative procedure, a vote on the longer part of the proposed government amendments was held over until this week.The new clause formally approved on Thursday would potentially extend existing rules which prevent the promotion or provision of financial services by unauthorized agents – and that power could now cover any cryptographically secured representations of value and rights using means such as Bitcoin-style distributed ledger technology.Griffith has promised a consultation on exactly how that power should be used before Christmas, and regulator the Financial Conduct Authority has already tentatively set out how it wants to restrict crypto ads.Read more: UK Crypto Investors Should Limit Holdings, Financial Regulator Says",2022/11/03
543,"In 2020, as U.S. presidential candidates squared off, the mob of Democratic hopefuls sought to separate themselves from the pack. As part of his bold campaign for fixing imbalances in the economy, Andrew Yang didn’t shy away from predicting cryptocurrencies may have a useful role.He joked at a recent event in Washington, D.C., that his campaign staff pleaded with him to stop talking about crypto.“My team didn't want me hammering that message in mainstream press appearances,” he told CoinDesk in an interview. His people wanted him to stick to another message, Yang said. But the U.S. electorate hasn’t generally clamored to send cutting-edge tech leaders to Washington, and his presidential campaign collapsed quickly.This year, crypto hasn’t apparently fared any better as a political topic in midterm congressional campaigns approaching the Nov. 8 general election. A remarkable few candidates have been willing to say anything at all about digital assets in public, though plenty have assured the industry privately about what they’d do for crypto and that their campaigns are worth supporting financially.Michelle Bond, CEO of the Association for Digital Asset Markets, which lobbies on behalf of crypto businesses in Washington, was among the rare cryptocurrency advocates who ran for Congress this year, and she quickly learned that crypto carried some political toxicity.“Crypto was not a welcome topic on the campaign trail, from the opponents I was running against, and also from the voters,” Bond, who sought the Republican nomination for a New York seat, said in an interview. She didn’t make crypto a significant point in her campaigning, but she didn’t have to, she said, because she carried that label whether she wanted to or not. “I was called the crypto queen.”She received 6491 votes, compared with the 11,398 won by the eventual Republican candidate. Elsewhere, Bruce Fenton, an early Bitcoin investor and advocate, sought the Republican nod for a seat in New Hampshire, but he drew only 4.4% of the vote in that primary. And in Oregon, Matt West, a decentralized finance (DeFi) developer, came in sixth in his Democratic primary, snaring 8%.There was a lot of crypto distrust among voters who didn’t know much about the industry, Bond said, arguing that lobbyists have been doing a good job educating policymakers but haven’t yet reached the broader public.“Crypto needs to do a much better job in the mainstream media,” she said, though the mainstream press has devoted plenty of attention in recent months to the dramatic collapse of several prominent firms, sunken token prices and endless hacker thefts. “We need to make advancements beyond, and we need to start touching those voters.”Crypto has a demographic. Those drawn to digital assets are most often men, and they’re most likely to be under 30, according to Pew Research Center data (and overwhelming bro-culture evidence). Young men are not big voters in the U.S., statistically. So when a politician starts going on about crypto, campaign advisers know they’re not likely to win a lot of votes with it, and they may risk alienating older folks who may be uneasy about this financial movement.About one in eight people in the U.S. currently hold crypto, according to a recent poll from the Crypto Council for Innovation. More than half of the 1,200 voters surveyed online – 52% – said they want more regulation for the crypto industry, while just 7% favored less oversight. So they favor the government being engaged, but they also indicated they’d be much less likely to vote for a candidate who supports cryptocurrencies.In another poll released this week, 37% of those surveyed said they’d consider a candidate’s views on crypto before casting their vote.Like Bond, another House candidate in Illinois, Jonathan Jackson – a businessman, professor and the son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson – also learned crypto support comes with a price. He drew political attacks for benefiting from hundreds of thousands of dollars that crypto industry sources spent on ads for his campaign. The money was deployed as “independent expenditures,” which is a way corporate sources or wealthy benefactors can pile unlimited cash into a campaign, so Jackson argued he had no choice about accepting the help.“By definition, an independent expenditure is just that, independent,” he told Chicago-area media in a statement. “We did not seek it, and we cannot control it.”Still, his campaign website is one of the few in the nation that openly touts the benefits of crypto, and since he claimed a decisive victory in his Democratic primary, he’s expected to win in the general election next week and join Congress next year.The crypto industry itself is well aware that it’s not going to win a lot of votes for its favored candidates. So when its political action committees (PAC) buy TV ads or mailers for candidates, the issues they highlight aren’t typically about crypto at all. They often focus on topics that are specifically important to the district or state their candidate is running in, so a viewer would hardly guess an ad was paid for by a crypto PAC if not for the small-print disclosures they may spot.The so-called crypto winter has strangled most feel-good stories about regular people gaining wealth in the new markets. Instead, many voters are likely to know somebody who has been having a tough time recently with crypto. That further suppresses candidates’ ability to make friends through digital-assets conversations.“It's not like anyone is rah, rah, rah, crypto right now,” said Bond, whose “crypto queen” label didn’t seem to help the political novice’s second-place outcome in the primaries, despite Crypto Innovation PAC spending more than $1 million dollars in advertising to support her.",2022/11/03
544,"While he’s best known as the co-creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin began his cryptocurrency journey in a role that often gets a bit less respect: journalist.Driven by his interest in Bitcoin, Buterin was a co-founder of and incredibly prolific contributor to Bitcoin Magazine starting way back in 2012. His writing about Bitcoin helped him deeply engage with the theory behind crypto, and formed connections to early projects like MasterCoin that shaped his ideas for Ethereum.Even after stepping back from journalism, Buterin has continued to guide thinking in the cryptocurrency world through blog posts on an array of topics. Now a selection of Buterin’s posts and related writing have been assembled in a proper book, “Proof of Stake: Making Ethereum and the Philosophy of Blockchains,” released Sept. 27 from Seven Stories Press.Curated and edited by University of Colorado Boulder media studies professor Nathan Schneider, the volume features important documents of the early days of Ethereum, but focuses largely on Buterin’s big-picture takes on deep questions about markets, money and society.The maturity and nuance of these essays makes them inherently interesting regardless of authorship. But they are important for two added reasons. First, reading essays stretching back as far as 2014 shows just how profoundly Buterin has shaped thinking about crypto: Many concepts and lines of reasoning that are now part of the fabric of crypto theory got their first or most prominent airing in Buterin’s writing.Second, the body of work in “Proof of Stake” demonstrates the sheer depth and complexity of thought that goes into designing economic and technical systems that are both innovative and sustainable. You might even argue that the intellectual foundations Buterin forged through writing have played a major role in the long-term success of Ethereum. Luna founder Do Kwon, to draw a particularly pointed contrast, is not exactly known for his care with words, a lack that might have been reflected in the nuance, or lack thereof, in Kwon’s wealth-annihilating creation.See also: Vitalik Buterin Warns of 'Pursuing Large Institutional Capital At Full Speed'Here are the key takeaways from the collection, according to staffers from Layer 2 – starting with Buterin’s rarely appreciated lighter side.– David Z. MorrisReading “Proof of Stake” reminded me of meeting its author, Vitalik Buterin, in 2014. It was hard to keep up with his train of thought, but he still managed to seem upbeat and open. While abstract and often technical, Buterin’s collected writing comes off as similarly personable – in no small part due to a wry sense of humor. In fact, Buterin often uses jokes to convey important ideas.The Ethereum creator’s witticisms range from dark comedy to inside baseball to low-key trolling. In a 2016 post describing commonalities between the crypto community and existential-risk researchers, Buterin defines the latter group’s fears this way: “[I]f you tried to tell a superintelligent AI [artificial intelligence] to cure cancer, it may end up reasoning that the most reliable way to do that is to simply kill everyone first. If you tried to plug that hole, it may decide to permanently cryogenically freeze all humans without killing them.”A notable difference between those two communities, Buterin writes, is that unlike the “Age of Ultron”-style AI that “X-Risk” scholars worry will wipe out humanity, in blockchains “the algorithms are dumb, and yet the agents that they have to control are quite smart. AI safety is about agents with IQ 150 trying to control agents with IQ 6,000, whereas cryptoeconomics is about agents with IQ 5 trying to control agents with IQ 150.”Buterin takes a few sly digs at the Bitcoin community he belonged to as a teenager before leaving to start Ethereum. In a 2017 post about blockchain governance, he defines the “bottom layer” of the stack, the “ultimate deciding layer,” as users’ ability to run whatever software they want, regardless of external decisions or pressures. This is surely something Bitcoin maximalists would agree with, and why they scoff at, for instance, environmentalists’ campaign to impose code changes from the top down.But to illustrate the idea, Buterin tweaks maxis’ noses with a scenario straight out of their worst nightmares: “[A]ll Bitcoin users wake up one day and decide to edit their clients’ source code and replace the entire code with an Ethereum client that listens to balances of a particular ERC20 token contract, then that means that that ERC-20 token is bitcoin.”In another 2017 post describing the different ways to gauge how decentralized a network is, Buterin challenges the assumption among many in the Bitcoin community that mining “consists of many small actors that make decisions independently.” Above a photo of a panel of top mining executives taken at the 2015 Scaling Bitcoin event in Hong Kong, he quips: “Can we really say that the uncoordinated-choice model is realistic when 90% of the Bitcoin network’s mining power is well-coordinated enough to show up together at the same conference?”Cryptocurrency exchanges, which make their money on trading fees, also get a subtle roasting. In his piece about blockchain governance, to illustrate the downsides of coin voting on protocol changes, Buterin imagines exchanges enticing investors to store coins with them so they can control the votes, which he suggests would not be in a network’s best interests. “Exchanges profit from chaos, so their incentives are clearly quite misaligned with users and coin holders,” Buterin writes.And in a 2021 post that tries to fathom why blockchain-based prediction markets gave Trump a double-digit probability of overturning the 2020 election even after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his challenge, Buterin offers this zinger: “Those who are experts in electoral politics have a hard time getting into crypto, and crypto has a large presence of not-always-correct forms of contrarianism, especially when it comes to politics.”These moments of levity take the edge off the otherwise intimidating challenge of exploring Buterin’s labyrinthine head.– Marc HochsteinIn his January 2014 essay, “Ethereum: A Next-Generation Cryptocurrency and Decentralized Application Platform,” Vitalik Buterin laid out the various features of Ethereum, a system that then existed only in his mind, and how it differs from Bitcoin.The essay served as Ethereum’s white paper, and became a model for many others. It explores the potential of smart contracts and how it enables transaction types such as financial contracts, multisignature escrow, savings accounts and even peer-to-peer gambling. In 2014, all of this was theory; in 2022, it’s reality.See also: 'Hey, Look, It's a Monkey!' Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Pokes Fun at Ape NFTsEthereum has grown into something real people (as many as half a million at last count) use. And it’s likely to continue growing. The problem of scalability – namely, the storage costs, the throughput concerns and the cost of gas to run the Ethereum blockchain – was just a twinkle in Buterin’s eye back in 2014.Even back then, Buterin realized blockchain scaling would be a community effort. Today, whole teams with names like Optimism, Arbitrum and Polygon are building different approaches to scaling Ethereum, demonstrating the much-desired plurality Buterin talks about in another 2014 post, “On Silos.”In this essay, Buterin argues that fragmentation in crypto is both inevitable and “the only way this space can reasonably prosper.” He starts with the assumption that people disagree, and it is only through agreeing to disagree that the Ethereum community can establish a “plurality of networks.”He also argues that the amount of room in the crypto space for projects with different preferences to develop makes a winner-take-all mentality “completely unnecessary and harmful.” That’s crucial to remember today, as fights between blockchain systems rage on.Fast forward a year to 2015, and Buterin is again writing about the fundamental advantages of distributed systems – this time noting how decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) can develop a type of “superrationality.” With publicly viewable source code, “not only is it the case that the organization will make it obvious to everyone if they start to cheat, it’s not even possible for the organization’s ‘mind’ to cheat.”If nothing else, this may remind us of how much the concept of a DAO has shifted, specifically in the declining emphasis on the “autonomous” element. In Buterin’s early writing DAOs were something like artificially intelligent businesses managed by a small human team, rather than the collaboration environments they’ve become.You can have an idea, but you can’t know how it will be applied. But for Buterin’s sake, let there be many ideas and many attempts to put it into practice.– Sage D. YoungOn the surface, Ethereum and subsequent smart-contract platforms have a simple and arguably somewhat boring value proposition. Ethereum wants to be like Bitcoin in that it leverages the protection of decentralization and censorship resistance to transcend national boundaries, but adds more complex (mainly financial) functions than Bitcoin can handle.But there are a number of broader, more sociological concepts that guide the kinds of projects created on Ethereum. “Proof of Stake” in many cases provides the earliest articulation of those concepts.In the 2014 essay “Markets, Institutions, and Currencies – A New Method of Social Incentivization,” Buterin makes the case for money that can, while functioning as a medium of exchange, also support particular social endeavors and public goods through their “seigniorage,” or the value of the money above what it costs to create.Buterin highlights an early example of this in Primecoin, which is still operational. Instead of simply searching, as Bitcoin does, for purely random hashes, Primecoin’s mining algorithm searches for prime numbers while minting new coins. People who use or accept Primecoin for transactions are supporting this mathematical quest by funding the hashpower to search for primes.Primecoin has fallen from the limelight since 2014, but its appearance here highlights another major benefit of reading “Proof of Stake” – an enhanced awareness of just how much experimentation and innovation took place in what now seems like crypto’s ancient history.The idea of money as social incentivization wasn’t born with Buterin – he draws inspiration from long-running local currencies like Berkshares. But it has been an underlying premise of both the proliferation of ERC-20 tokens around the 2018 initial coin offering (ICO) boom and, more recently, the rise of affinity-based DAOs that issue their own token to help organize around particular causes or goals. The idea of a currency as a form of social organization is still relatively unproven, but it’s a major premise behind Ethereum’s culture.The “Markets” essay also provides a touchpoint for Buterin’s intellectual evolution over the years documented here. In this early essay, he flatly claims that “Markets, in their pure form, are fully decentralized.” But by 2020, in a piece called “Credible Neutrality as a Guiding Principle,” Buterin’s views on markets had become more complex: in place of the earlier implied Austrian-school or Lockean naturalist view of economics, he acknowledges the importance of governments in enforcing property rights as a precondition of markets.Buterin also rightly identifies this need for the state as a problem, particularly since governments are so often opaque and so rarely selfless. “Credible neutrality,” the idea that blockchains cannot be seen to favor or disfavor any one entity, has not yet entirely caught on as a crypto narrative, mostly because it’s not nearly as sexy as, say, “digital gold.” But for those thinking long-term about globalization and the fitful decline of nation-states, it may be the most compelling case of all.Navigating a logistically unified world still riven by political and social tensions demands, as Buterin puts it, that “everyone must be able to see that the mechanism is fair,” whether that’s the mechanism of exchange or communication. The cryptocurrency and blockchain model tick many boxes for credible neutrality, for instance with their use of open-source code.However, Buterin does presciently warn that simplicity is another requirement for real transparency: as we’ve seen in the recent crypto unwind, even open-source code can be used to hide a fraud if it’s complex enough.– Ben SchillerThe last chapter of Vitalik Buterin’s “Proof of Stake” begins with a thought experiment about “World of Warcraft,” the massive multiplayer online role-playing game Buterin often cites as his motivation for getting involved in the world of crypto. Buterin reportedly played WoW incessantly between 2007 and 2010, until game creators Blizzard “nerfed” one his “beloved warlocks’” powerful spells.“I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring,” Buterin wrote (half-seriously) on an about.me page that has seemingly since been scrapped. The experience led him to open-source tech, primarily Bitcoin, which offered a different vision for digitization based on decentralization and immutability.Unfortunately, Buterin’s blog post about Warlocks is not part of the new book, though there are plenty of other gems. The best parts of “Proof of Stake” concern Ethereum’s practicality – how the second-largest blockchain can actually be used. This stretches from Buterin’s initial thoughts on decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, – a type of non-state, non-corporate way to manage projects – to “prediction markets,” a long-theorized way of crowdsourcing truth through betting platforms.Take also Buterin’s earliest writing on Soulbound tokens, which were pitched as sort of curriculum vitae, a way to record all of a person’s achievements. As the name implies, soulbound tokens are unique digital assets held onto for life. This is opposed to non-fungible tokens (NFT), which are also singularly scarce but transferable.Buterin, perhaps still thinking about his Warlock, writes NFTs and WoW weapons are similar in an important way: they’re digital goods that have value and utility, but can be bought instead of earned. If NFTs and in-game items are often more about “signaling wealth,” Buterin writes, Soulbound tokens reflect the “sacrifice” of time or energy to create them. SBTs cannot be purchased, they can only be earned.In writing, when Buterin is coining terms or inventing use cases, he’s clarifying the ideas of others. His essay on “decentralized governance,” (or DeGov, to use Buterin’s parlance that never caught on), focuses on live projects that use on-chain voting, and how those situations, often corrupted by perverse incentives and monopolization, can be improved.There are a few guiding principles that run throughout the book, which seemingly motivate Buterin in everything he builds. The first is that transparency is better than opacity, that public chains are better than private and that communities should always be at the center of what you build.In an essay on trustlessness, Buterin reflects abstractly on how code can replace companies. He argues there will always be varying levels of trust, even within open, free and decentralized crypto protocols. Likewise, the world will always have companies like Blizzard, that make choices in pursuit of profit that are detrimental to customers.If there is no way out of trust, crypto, for Buterin, offers an alternative way of establishing it between self-interested actors. With the right design, crypto can make the better choice between getting yours and being prosocial, whatever it is that’s best for the all. Still, no one knows where all of this will lead. Least of all Buterin, who writes that in DAOs a “specific actor” will “behave in a specific way,” even if specific changes “push them to act in some different, unexpected way in the future.”Throughout his decade-long writing career, an exercise in trying to better understand and improve the thing he loves, Buterin has seen many of the ideas he’s proposed or advocated for put into practice. Take the proof-of-stake algorithm, the namesake of the book, which went live on Ethereum a month or so ago. This one change, which required years of deliberation and testing and refining, immediately cut the blockchain’s significant energy use. For this Buterin should be immensely proud – if only for demonstrating the practical effects crypto has on the world.In the introduction, Schnieder notes Buterin is forever a journalist, cursed with a keen eye for drama and truth-telling. Twice now, during different peaks of crypto and Ethereum hype (in 2017 and more recently), Buterin has questioned whether the machine he helped build “deserves” the level of attention it had achieved. Things are broken, incentives are misaligned and scams run amok.See also: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Praises 'Bitcoin Maximalism' (Maybe)Or as Buterin put it in the soulbound essay: “A common criticism of the ‘[W]eb3’ space as it exists today is how money-oriented everything is. People celebrate the ownership, and outright waste, of large amounts of wealth, and this limits the appeal and the long-term sustainability of the culture that emerges around these digital collectibles.”But solutions are possible, economics can be modeled and communities can take root, as Ethereum takes on a life of its own.– Daniel Kuhn",2022/11/03
545,"Digital asset platform Bakkt Holdings (BKKT) will acquire crypto trading infrastructure firm Apex Crypto from Apex Fintech Solutions, the firm said on Thursday.Bakkt, which is majority-owned by financial exchange Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), will initially pay $55 million in cash at the closing of the deal, and up to $145 million in Bakkt stock and seller notes upon achievement of some financial targets.The deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2023, will offer revenue growth, cost saving and synergies for Bakkt. It will also help the firm expand its crypto client base. Apex Crypto offers solutions for execution, clearing, custody, cost basis and tax services.Established in 2018, Bakkt initially raised $182.5 million to build out its bitcoin (BTC) futures and options product. It went public last October after completing a merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings.Goldman Sachs (GS) was the financial adviser for Bakkt. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, PC, and Alston & Bird LLP were acting as legal advisers for Bakkt, while Sidley Austin LLP was legal adviser to Apex Fintech Solutions.“With the addition of this complementary business, we believe we are poised to be a crypto provider of choice for financial institutions, fintechs, merchants or loyalty programs that want to offer seamless crypto experiences to their customers,"" said Gavin Michael, CEO of Bakkt.

546,"Last November, at the height of the bull market, Crypto.com announced it had obtained the naming rights to the stadium that houses the National Basketball Association (NBA) team Los Angeles Lakers, and on Christmas Day 2021, the venue was renamed the Crypto.com arena.Months prior, FTX won the rights to rename the American Airlines Arena, which houses the NBA's Miami Heat, to the FTX Arena.But the question remains: Throughout the prolonged crypto winter, are the investments in stadium branding proving to be worthwhile? Are they leading to a new cohort of retail users?While Los Angeles and Miami are known for their temperate climates throughout the year, the crypto market is anything but right now.“During a bear market, retail users lose interest in crypto, and no amount of sponsorship can help change this view,” said CoinGecko co-founder and COO Bobby Ong.Data provided by CryptoQuant shows that Crypto.com has struggled to maintain the spike in activity that the initial sponsorship announcement brought.At the beginning of November 2021, there were just over 2,000 active addresses for Crypto.com’s Cronos (CRO), its exchange token. Tracking the number of CRO holders is important as it's a good proxy for the number of engaged traders, not those only putting in a few dollars, as exchange token holders get fee discounts on trades.In the days following the sponsorship announcement, the number of active addresses spiked to almost 10,000.“The number of active addresses for CRO increased 4.5x after the announcement,” Burak Tamac, a senior researcher at CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk. “There was also a transaction count increase that coincided with the number of active addresses.”But following that, the number of active addresses sank back to Earth.News that the exchange was sponsoring the Formula 1, UEFA Champions League, and World Cup didn’t boost active user numbers the same way the L.A. stadium sponsorship did, which led the exchange to look to start canceling its partnerships.A report from the trade publication Ad Age says that the exchange continues to look for exits from its sponsorship deals while it cuts its headcount.When asked about the data behind its sponsorship decision, Crypto.com provided a statement via email from Steven Kalifowitz, the firm’s chief marketing officer: “We have more than 50 million users worldwide, and we will continue to invest in our sports partnerships as they play a pivotal role in helping to accelerate the world's adoption of cryptocurrency.""Some might say that the bump in CRO’s active users is coincidental, as it coincides with 2020’s bull market hysteria.But Tamac points to FTX’s sponsorship of the Miami Heat Arena and the subsequent jump in FTT token active addresses when the deal was announced in April 2021 — in what was an otherwise boring crypto market, as month-on-month bitcoin only gained about 2% — as proof of a trend.FTX didn’t respond to a request for comment.CryptoQuant’s Tamac said it would be tough to get data on specific cohorts of users just by looking at on-chain data.At the time, crypto trading apps were making their way into the top charts of the Apple App Store, alongside trading platforms like Robinhood and Webull. This was the meme stock era, after all, and the action was on mobile.Data from mobile app insights firm Data.ai (formerly App Annie) shows that Crypto.com’s app didn’t have sustained interest.Data.ai’s Head of Insights Lexi Sydow pointed to a 122% month-over-month increase in mobile app downloads in October 2021 and another 67% month-over-month increase in November 2021 as proof that the sponsorship deal “caught the attention of consumers.”But, like the active user count of the CRO and FTT tokens, both quickly fell.“Crypto sports sponsorships are useful to gain the attention of retail users during a bull market, when crypto prices are rising,” adds CoinGecko’s Ong.“Crypto exchanges were in a rush to ink such brand sponsorships to be top of mind and the first brand that retail users sign up when searching for a crypto exchange.”Binance, by far, is the world’s largest crypto exchange, dominating its rivals by a large margin. Its CEO, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, is worth nearly $100 billion (excluding crypto holdings), and the company is known to be cash rich.So the exchange might be a perfect candidate for high-profile sponsorships, but CZ has said no.While Binance has sponsored some Brazillian soccer teams and the African Cup of Nations tournament, both are fairly low profile in comparison to what others have sponsored with the $2.4 billion price tag.“It was not easy saying no to Super Bowl ads, stadium naming rights, and large sponsor deals a few months ago, but we did,” CZ tweeted in June, at the depths of this year’s crypto crash, highlighting that Binance was hiring for 2,000 positions.If there’s any consolation for Crypto.com, it might be found in its mobile app ranking.While the crypto winter has forced most crypto apps from the top-ranking lists of app stores, Crypto.com’s app ranks as the #47 most-downloaded mobile phone app for September 2022, while Binance is #61 (just behind TradFi’s SoFi, which also sponsored a stadium).All this as Binance pushes around $5 billion in spot volume per day, according to CoinGecko, while Crypto.com does $233 million.Perhaps stadium sponsorship does have an effect, though ever so small.",2022/11/03

And sign up for First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.Crypto Prices Fall After Rate HikeBy James RubinThe U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates a widely anticipated 75 basis points for the fourth consecutive time.Ether, dogecoin and other major altcoins didn't like the sound of that, and tumbled well into the red Wednesday afternoon.Bitcoin fell more moderately.ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was recently trading a few fractions above $1,500, down more than 4% over the past 24 hours but right around its perch of the past week. DOGE was recently down about 10%, returning some of its recent, dramatic gains. The popular meme token was still trading above 12 cents, near its highest point in more than six months.Meanwhile, BTC continued to hover over its most recent $20,000 support line, down 1.8% from Tuesday, same time, despite rising investor interest. CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams noted on Wednesday that the crypto winter had given bullish investors an opportunity to accumulate bitcoin at a favorable cost basis. ""Larger crypto investors are continuing to explore this opportunity,"" Williams wrote, adding: ""Whether asset managers are picking the right price point to go long will play out over the next 12 months, but they appear to be ahead of the curve.""The CoinDesk Market Index declined about 2.5%.Meanwhile, major equity markets plunged following the Fed’s announcement, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq off 3.3% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) off 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively. Investors remain concerned about the central bank’s strategy to combat rising prices, and the prospect of a harsh recession. Safe haven gold sank 0.7%.In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Nischal Shetty, co-founder of Indian crypto exchange WazirX, said he ""wouldn't be surprised if we see downward pressure on prices,"" although he was upbeat about bitcoin's recent tenacity. ""Bitcoin seems to be holding strong at $20,000; that's an important point,"" he said.Arbitrum Is More Than Hype, According to On-Chain DataBy Shaurya MalwaCrypto traders and investors are increasingly seeing the Arbitrum ecosystem as a likely spot for capturing returns along the lines of the 100-times-plus multiples sometimes witnessed in prior bull-market cycles.The Ethereum-based scaling product, which allows traders to transact on the blockchain network for under a few cents in fees and transacting times of a few seconds, is among a flurry of blockchain networks that launched in the past year – each promising to be faster and cheaper than the previous one.On-chain data shows Arbitrum is not all hype. Since August, weekly transactions on Arbitrum have skyrocketed over 550%, with the Arbitrum network now commanding more than 62% of the weekly transactions on Ethereum.The total value locked (TVL) on Arbitrum has increased by over $400 million in the past few months, data from DeFiLlama shows, with the ecosystem now holding over $1 billion. Popular trading tool GMX accounts for 43% of all this TVL.Weekly active users on Arbitrum have also spiked in the past two weeks, analysts at research firm Delphi Digital said in a report this week.“Since Oct. 10, weekly active users have grown 125% to reach a new all-time high of 282K, even surpassing numbers recorded during the Arbitrum Odyssey event,” they said, referring to a week-long initiative held in July meant for users to explore the Arbitrum ecosystem with exclusive non-fungible tokens (NFT) as rewards.Delphi analysts added that much of the ongoing activity was also “likely from speculators trying to boost their on-chain activity in the hopes of receiving a larger airdrop.”“Users could also be taking advantage of the various yield farming opportunities offered by protocols on Arbitrum,” they further added.Arbitrum developers had not announced any tokens, or even plans for any tokens, as of Wednesday.

Its hosting partner Compute North, one of the largest in the U.S., filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September,  unsettling the market about Marathon's deployment prospects.Despite these headwinds, Marathon energized 32,000 machines during October, increasing its hashrate by 84%. The miner's computing power is now 7 exahash/second (EH/s), the press release said, making it one of the world's largest miners.The bitcoin mined in October almost matches the 616 it mined for the entire third quarter.The rest of Marathon's hashrate is supposed to come online by mid-2023 through a 200 megwatt (MW) hosting deal with Applied Blockchain (APLD), an additional 42 MW with troubled Compute North and 12 MW with undisclosed firms.

Such reactions are normal in asset markets of all stripes.During the recent rate hikes, BTC’s average true range (ATR) has declined approximately 71%. ETH’s ATR has declined 52%.Yet, the pattern has differed in one respect – BTC and ETH have displayed less volatility than traditional assets. Will that trend change? Will the latest robust interest rate hike on Wednesday jar markets?In remarks following the Fed’s announcement, Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the bank’s months-long commitment to quell rising prices. But a Fed statement earlier in the day offered investors some hope that the present monetary hawkishness would end in the near future.""In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments,"" the FOMC said.The dovish signals are likely to send BTC and ETH higher, breaking them from their recent staid mode.And asset managers will then surely – and wisely – take advantage of this likely upturn. A recent Commitment of Traders (COT) report showed that asset managers have increased their long positions in BTC while reducing their short positions. Asset managers’ open interest in BTC is now 88% long and 12% short, up from 84% long the prior week.As asset managers generally hold larger sums of deployable capital, they have the ability to sway market prices with their activities.Looking on-chain, the BTC Exchange Stablecoins ratio implies a sense of bullishness. The tool essentially measures the volume of stablecoins on exchanges to the amount of BTC present. As the ratio declines it implies growing buying power because investors generally move stablecoins on to exchanges prior to purchasing an asset.Whether asset managers are picking the right price point to go long will play out over the next 12 months, but they appear to be ahead of the curve.",2022/11/02
551,"The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by 75 basis points (0.75 percentage point) to a range of 3.75% to 4 % in a move that was widely anticipated by market participants, including bitcoin (BTC) traders.It's the fourth consecutive rate hike of that magnitude by the Fed, which has aggressively been moving to jack up borrowing costs to cool the economy and in turn help bring down the highest inflation rate in four decades. Consumer prices have been rising at a pace of 8% on a 12-month basis, more than four times the Fed's target.“Ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time,“ according to a statement from the Fed's monetary-policy panel, known as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).Crypto traders watch the Fed because the price of bitcoin often tracks U.S. stocks; the theory is that tighter monetary policy makes risky assets less attractive.Bitcoin rose 1.3% in the moments after the announcement by the FOMC.Further clues about the path ahead could come from Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.“Inflation continues to be sticky and high so rate hikes will continue, but the pace of hiking is set to slow,” said Nick Hotz, vice president of research at Arca. “Any sign of the Fed easing up would be taken as very bullish short-term for digital assets.”Recent comments by central bankers suggest that this month's rate hike could be the last at an increment of 75 basis points – three times as fast as the typical increment in prior economic cycles.San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly, for example, warned last month that the Fed could push the economy into an “unforced downturn” if it raised rates too fast.The FOMC's statement suggested that the officials will keep a close eye on how the economy and inflation are responding to the recent series of rate hikes.""In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments,"" according to the FOMC statement.Even though inflation in the U.S. has slowed from a year ago in recent months, it is still rising on a monthly basis, adding pressure on the Fed to not back down from tightening monetary policy.Officials are also still trying to avoid an ugly recession and ease the pain of investors who have been grappling with a volatile U.S. Treasury market and falling stock prices.Crypto assets have also seen a big drop in price ever since inflation started reaching painful levels earlier this year.With inflation still running at 8.1% it might be too soon for central bankers to reverse course, given that the goal is 2%.It could also be dangerous, because it could weaken the U.S. dollar against other currencies. The strength of the dollar is part of the reason why the U.S. economy is seeing much lower inflation than other countries, such as those in the European Union.At a press conference following the announcement, Powell gave several hints that the Fed is considering slowing the pace of rate hikes in the near future.""At some point it will become appropriate to slow … and it may come as soon as the next meeting, or the one after that,” he said. ""It is likely we'll have a discussion about this at the next meeting.""While slowing is a possibility, pausing isn't at this point, Powell reiterated. He stressed that he doesn't think that the Fed has overtightened and that it is “very premature” to discuss pausing and ""not a conversation to be had.""The chair did, however, say that ""how high to raise rates is more important than the pace of tightening.""UPDATE (Nov. 2 18:11 UTC): Adds quotes from FOMC statement and further information on inflation.UPDATE (Nov. 2 19:31 UTC): Adds quotes from Chair Powell's press conference.",2022/11/02

The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 0.7%.Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk that traders will look toward Powell’s post-meeting commentary to “gauge the Fed's sentiment for future hikes.”“The point here is to identify a potential pivot point to return toward risk-on assets,” he said.There have been divergent views on whether the Fed will pivot to a dovish approach on interest rate hikes for the December and subsequent monetary-policy meetings, with major investment banks warning that the Fed could keep raising borrowing costs for longer.“Markets want clarity on where the Fed will at least pause the current rate hike cycle, but Chair Powell is not really in any position to provide that just yet,” Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a Wednesday note.",2022/11/02
553,"Billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency empire is officially broken into two main parts: FTX (his exchange) and Alameda Research (his trading firm), both giants in their respective industries.But even though they are two separate businesses, the division breaks down in a key place: on Alameda’s balance sheet, according to a private financial document reviewed by CoinDesk. (It is conceivable the document represents just part of Alameda.)That balance sheet is full of FTX – specifically, the FTT token issued by the exchange that grants holders a discount on trading fees on its marketplace. While there is nothing per se untoward or wrong about that, it shows Bankman-Fried’s trading giant Alameda rests on a foundation largely made up of a coin that a sister company invented, not an independent asset like a fiat currency or another crypto. The situation adds to evidence that the ties between FTX and Alameda are unusually close.Read the latest: Binance Is Strongly Leaning Toward Scrapping FTX Rescue Takeover After First Glance at Books: SourceThe financials make concrete what industry-watchers already suspect: Alameda is big.

A $2.16 billion pile of “FTT collateral.”There are more FTX tokens among its $8 billion of liabilities: $292 million of “locked FTT.” (The liabilities are dominated by $7.4 billion of loans.)“It’s fascinating to see that the majority of the net equity in the Alameda business is actually FTX’s own centrally controlled and printed-out-of-thin-air token,” said Cory Klippsten, CEO of investment platform Swan Bitcoin, who is known for his critical views of altcoins, which refer to cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin (BTC).Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison declined to comment. FTX didn't respond to a request for comment.Other significant assets on the balance sheet include $3.37 billion of “crypto held” and large amounts of the Solana blockchain’s native token: $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.” Bankman-Fried was an early investor in Solana.

559,"Investors who foresee renewed volatility in ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) can consider building an option strategy that profits from an increase in price turbulence.Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, recommended buying short-term ether options ""straddles"" to benefit from potential price swings following Wednesday's all-important U.S. Federal Reserve rate decision.Buying a straddle involves purchasing both bullish call and bearish put options with the same expiry and at the same level or strike price. Buying a call means purchasing insurance against bullish price moves while buying a put implies hedging against price slides. Option buyers pay a premium to sellers as compensation for offering protection.When an entity buys a straddle, it's doing so in hopes that the underlying asset will either surge or tank enough to recover more than what was paid to purchase the strategy.""Ether is expected to move by +/- 5.85% after the [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting, based on derivatives markets data. This implies that ether will finish the week at $1,485 or $1,670 (spot $1,578). This seems too narrow. Buying short-term straddles (buy calls and buy puts), which benefit from wide swings, might offer good risk reward here,"" Thielen said in a note sent to clients early Wednesday.Expectations for post-Fed price turbulence appear underpriced and options tied to Ethereum's native token look cheap. The annualized one-month ether implied volatility, or traders' expectations for price turbulence over four weeks, currently stands at 81% versus 96%, seen ahead of the September Fed meeting, according to data tracked by Matrixport.Implied volatility has a positive impact on options prices. Traders often compare implied volatility over specific periods to gauge whether volatility expectations are overpriced/underpriced and options are trading cheap or costly. The common mantra is to buy options when implied volatility is cheap relative to its historical standard/realized volatility and sell options when the implied volatility is too high.""Implied volatility is roughly 15 [volatility] points lower compared to the last FOMC meeting, which makes option prices significantly cheaper than at the last FOMC meeting,"" Thielen noted.The bitcoin market has seen a similar ""implied volatility meltdown"" in recent weeks, making options cheaper.Bitcoin's annualized three-month implied volatility recently slipped to nearly 50%, a level seen only five times since 2020. The one-month implied volatility dropped to 56%, according to data from Arcane Research and derivatives analytics platform Laevitas.""The low implied volatilities are a suitable environment for contrarian bets on reappearing BTC volatility,"" Lunde wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.""The timing could be great for straddle strategies purchasing far-dated expiring puts and calls.

560,"A Twitter user by the name “Burak” (@brqgoo) sent a large swath of the Lightning Network into turmoil on Tuesday morning when he allegedly created a non-standard Bitcoin transaction that prevented users from opening new Lightning channels (connections between Lightning nodes).Lightning is a layer 2 network that runs atop the Bitcoin blockchain to enable cheaper and faster transactions. Burak’s valid but non-standard transaction caused Bitcoin nodes running an implementation of Bitcoin called btcd to reject valid incoming blocks. This caused a corresponding glitch on all Lightning Network Daemon (LND) nodes. LND nodes rely on information from btcd Bitcoin nodes, and the glitch caused LND nodes to deny all new channel opening requests.Read more: Kollider Raises $2.4M to Build ‘Lightning-Native’ Financial ProductsBurak’s shenanigans disrupted a good chunk of the Bitcoin and Lightning ecosystems. Nevertheless, one could argue the community’s anti-fragility was on full display. Core Lightning (CLN) nodes that rely on Bitcoin Core, the most popular implementation of Bitcoin, were unaffected (although this seems to have been by design). Additionally, the bug Burak exploited was quickly patched (thanks to Elle Mouton and Oliver Gugger).“Given the context, it seems Burak was well aware of the consequences triggered by the transaction. I think everyone can decide for themselves if that is to be considered malicious or not,” Rene Pickhardt, Bitcoin and Lightning developer and educator, told CoinDesk. Pickhardt co-authored the popular “Mastering Lightning” book and helped demystify many technical aspects of this story.Burak’s actions not only sparked lively exchanges on Twitter, but also raised a key question – how should the Bitcoin community handle similar exploits in the future?“Generally, developers promote a well-known culture of responsible disclosure and ethics when discovering exploitable bugs. Lightning Labs had a reasonable plan for patching this problem beforehand, but maybe Burak felt the situation was more urgent and wanted to light a fire under [them],” John Carvalho told CoinDesk. Carvalho is the CEO of Bitcoin software firm, Synonym. The firm’s chief technology officer, Reza Bandegi, also helped clarify technical aspects for this report.Read more: Bitcoin Software Company Synonym Launches Bitkit, a Bitcon Wallet Powered by Slashtags ProtocolWhat Carvalho is describing could be further incentivized by establishing robust bug bounty programs. “It's always hard to prepare against a novel bug. I guess more review and bug bounty programs for responsible disclosure may help.” Pickhardt weighed in. “However, as I understand, Pieter Wuille thinks there may sometimes be a risk in fixing bugs, as that may raise awareness and attract potential malicious actors in the transition phase while nodes update.”Indeed, Bitcoin developer Pieter Wuille thinks the process of fixing bugs and managing exploits is not always straightforward.“I don't think it's necessarily that simple. It'd be reasonable to assume that exploiting this needed cooperation from miners (or ones with non-standard mempool/relay policy at least), making it harder to pull off. And fixing this one-line without raising suspicion is hard,” Wuille tweeted.Wuille has a point. Rumors were circulating that Burak paid $700 to F2Pool, one of the largest Bitcoin mining pools, to have his non-standard transaction included in one of their blocks. He then embedded a bizarre message in the transaction, “You'll run CLN and you'll be happy,"" a reference to Core Lightning (CLN), which, as discussed above, is an alternative to LND, the Lightning implementation affected by the exploit.“I can't speak for Burak, but it took some special effort and expense to perform his demonstration, so I have to assume he knew exactly what he was doing and that he at least wanted to draw attention to himself, LND, and apparently, CLN too, because he left a supportive message for CLN within the instigating transaction on-chain,” Carvalho explained.Christian Decker, a researcher at Bitcoin infrastructure firm, Blockstream and contributor to the CLN project, distanced his team from the exploit and publicly denounced Burak’s actions.CORRECTION (Nov. 2, 2022, 14:24 UTC): Fixes the explanation in the second paragraph, a quote in the fourth paragraph and John Carvalho's last name.",2022/11/02

And sign up for First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.DOGE Continues to Climb; Bitcoin Trades FlatBy James RubinThe DOGE were on the loose again in Tuesday trading, while bitcoin and ether remained more tightly leashed.The popular meme coin was recently trading over 13 cents, a more than 12% gain for the past 24 hours and its highest point since late April. DOGE has been soaring since the middle of last week as billionaire entrepreneur and dogecoin enthusiast Elon Musk neared the close of his $44 billion purchase of social media platform Twitter.BTC and ETH were recently changing hands sideways with the largest cryptocurrency in market value down a smidgen and ether in the green. Bitcoin held its place snuggling above the $20,000 threshold it assumed more than a week ago amid hopeful signs the U.S. central bank will scale back its current diet of hefty interest rate hikes by early next year, if not sooner. The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, will likely announce a fourth consecutive 75 basis point increase on Wednesday.Yet recent indicators suggest that inflation will soon be waning meaningfully without throwing the economy into a harsh recession. As CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams wrote, investors hoping for a more dovish turn in monetary policy may look optimistically at a percentage decline in the M2 money supply growth from a year ago. The parabolic increase in U.S. money supply during 2020 is largely behind the current inflationary environment. The reduced supply growth could be evidence that recent Federal Reserve measures are working.DOGE was not the only altcoin to surge as UNI recently rose 3.3%. Decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap’s native token was up more than 5.1% at one point and has climbed more than 10% over the past week. The gains have followed Uniswap's closing of a $165 million Series B funding round earlier in October.Meanwhile, equity markets closed down slightly with the tech heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropping 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively.Noting an unexpected increase in job openings in the latest U.S. JOLTs (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) data, Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote pessimistically that ""momentum was building on expectations for the Fed to downshift their tightening pace in December, but now that call seems like it may have been premature. Rates might need to stay higher for longer if the labor market is still healthy and inflation ends up being stickier than markets are initially thinking.""Moya added: ""It seems like Wall Street might have to wait until the New Year for the Fed to downshift, which means Bitcoin could be vulnerable to finish the week lower.""What Does Hong Kong's Policy Statement Really Mean?By Sam ReynoldsHong Kong may be “ready to engage” with the digital assets industry to provide retail investors with a “suitable degree of access to virtual assets,” but the industry still needs to see more details of what this plan entails, says Ripple’s Rahul Advani, the firm’s policy director for APAC.“The tone has changed slightly,” Advani told CoinDesk.Previously, Hong Kong authorities had been adamant that investment in virtual assets was only to be the domain of professional (accredited) investors. Sam Bankman-Fried cited this as one of the reasons, alongside COVID-19 restrictions, why FTX moved its headquarters from Hong Kong to the Bahamas last year.“But I think the statement was very broad,” Advani continued. “What we’re expecting to see next is a consultation from the [Securities and Futures Commission], which will have more specifics on what that permission looks like.”Advani believes that the “devil is in the details.” There could be all sorts of clauses the SFC throws in, like suitability tests or other types of restrictions on how much you can trade and trading venues such as what Singapore has.In Singapore, the government is not anti-retail crypto, but it has been “very clear that not all retail investors should be investing in crypto assets,” Advani said, pointing to a recent consultation from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which advocates for suitability tests for investors and restrictions on borrowing to purchase crypto.“Singapore is ensuring that there are safeguards in place,” he said. “They’ve said that they aren’t going to ban retail participation in crypto because that’s going to move the market offshore. And it's not solving risks.”Hong Kong vs. Singapore?While some have argued that the crown for Asia’s crypto hub is a zero-sum, winner-take-all, game. Advani doesn’t agree.“I don't think it's a question of Singapore versus Hong Kong. I think the market is big enough that both Singapore and Hong Kong can coexist,” he said.Retail crypto’s rise in Hong Kong doesn’t come at a cost to Singapore. But the question remains, what will that rise look like? For now, everyone is in wait-and-see mode.“It’s a positive statement that we’ve seen from the Hong Kong government ... We’re waiting to see that consultation.”8:15 p.m. HKT/SGT(12:15 UTC) United States ADP Employment Change (Oct.)2:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(18:00 UTC) United States Fed's Monetary Policy Statement6:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(22:00 UTC) Australia S&P Global Services PMI (Oct.)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Dogecoin Trumps All Other Major Cryptos in October; Binance Exec on Future of Twitter Under Elon Musk:Binance Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann joined ""First Mover"" to discuss the crypto exchange's involvement in Twitter under the direction of Elon Musk.

564,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) posted a minimal digital asset impairment charge of $727,000 on its bitcoin (BTC) holdings in the third quarter, down significantly from $917.8 million in the second quarter as the price of bitcoin remained relatively stable at the end of the second and third quarters, according to its latest earnings report.The company's digital asset impairment reflects the decline in the price of bitcoin versus the price at which the bitcoin was acquired. Under standard accounting rules the value of digital assets such as cryptocurrencies must be recorded at their cost and then only adjusted if their value is impaired, or goes down. But if the price rises, that does not get reported unless an asset is sold.In its earnings press release, MicroStrategy noted it was encouraged by the Financial Accounting Standards Board's recent support of the use of fair value accounting for bitcoin, which would allow companies to report losses and gains immediately, as they would other traditional financial assets. MicroStrategy's chief financial officer, Andrew Kang, said in a statement he thought such a change would ""promote additional institutional adoption of bitcoin as an asset class.""Executive Chairman Michael Saylor echoed Kang's optimism on MicroStrategy's conference call Wednesday, adding that bitcoin will benefit as more clarity and guidance is offered. ""It doesn't mean that we have enough guidance to change our accounting,"" Saylor said on the call, though when considering next steps, ""we know we have unanimous support to adopt fair value accounting for bitcoin,"" he added.Additionally, Saylor and CEO Phong Le expressed optimism about the payments potential of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, and for MicroStrategy to bring value in this area.Between Aug. 2 and Sept. 19, MicroStrategy bought 301 bitcoins for about $6 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The purchase brought MicroStrategy's total holdings of bitcoin to almost 130,000. At bitcoin’s current price of about $20,440, the value of those holdings is approximately $2.66 billion. MicroStrategy's entire market capitalization is roughly $2.9 billion.While MicroStrategy’s large purchases of bitcoin in 2021 and early 2022 were funded via the issuance of secured notes and sales of its common stock, the company’s much more modest acquisitions of bitcoin in the second and third quarter of 2022 were made simply using excess cash, the company reported.As of Sept. 30, 2022, the original cost basis and market value of MicroStrategy’s bitcoin holdings were $3.983 billion and $2.532 billion, respectively, which reflects an average cost per bitcoin of approximately $30,639 and a market price per bitcoin of $19,480.51, the company reported.Overall, MicroStrategy reported a third-quarter adjusted earnings loss of 96 cents a share versus analyst consensus estimate for a loss of 15 cents, on revenue of $125.4 million, short of estimates for $127.2 million.Following the release of its results, MicroStrategy shares were rising about 2.3% to $263.

Excessive unfilled job openings can often have an inflationary impact because organizations increase wages to attract candidates.In early October, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said that it would be appropriate to pause the lending rate that the central bank charges other banks at slightly more than 4.5% by March 2023. The Fed is expected to increase the rate to 3.75%-4.0% on Wednesday. At the start of the year, the rate was 0.25%.Bitcoin has slowed its pace of acceleration ahead of the rate decision. Its price has settled just above the psychologically important $20,000 mark, after last week’s 8% increase.Prices have declined the past two days, but reduced volume and a compressed trading range signal reluctance more than it does a bearish shift.A similar pattern is in place for ETH, although the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value traded slightly higher on Tuesday. ETH, now trading above $1,500, has largely outperformed BTC recently, with the ETH/BTC currency pair rising 14% since Oct. 20.On-chain data shows an increase in the BTC mining hashrate, which bears monitoring if BTC’s price contracts. The hashrate refers to the amount of computing power required to process bitcoin transactions, so higher rates in conjunction with lower prices lead to compressed margins for bitcoin miners. As those margins contract, miners may have to sell BTC to stay afloat.Currently, the BTC balance for miners has started to increase, which should be a positive sign.Funding rates within perpetual futures contracts should also be monitored because they can indicate overall investor sentiment.

Decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap’s UNI token was recently up 5.1% over the past 24 hours and has risen more than 10% during the past week despite mixed news highlighting its expansion but also its alleged popularity among scammers.UNI also rose more than 16% in October. Its surge coincides with a more dramatic late-October spike by DOGE, which was recently trading over 13 cents, a more than 10% gain from Monday, same time, and its highest point since late April. The popular meme coin rose more than 100% in October, most of the increase occurring in the last week of the month as billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk neared completion of his purchase of Twitter.Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, spent a second consecutive day trading sideways, albeit tinted more green than red. BTC was holding comfortably over $20,000, its most recent support line, while ether continued to hover over $1,500, where it climbed last week.Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, tied UNI’s rise to a $165 million Series B funding round led by Polychain Capital that Uniswap announced Oct. 13. CoinDesk also reported last month that UNI would soon be deployed on privacy-focused layer 2 tool zkSync following the completion of a governance vote. The firm said the zkSync ecosystem has more than 100 projects committed to launching on its main network, including top decentralized-finance (DeFi) platforms, infrastructure products and on/off ramps.Uniswap has “a very high market share of volume,” which is ""benefitting disproportionately compared to other DEX tokens,"" said Lucas Outumuro, head of research at crypto data and analysis firm IntoTheBlock.But Twitter has been buzzing over the past two days about a Jan. 20 report that 97.7% of tokens launched on Uniswap were rug pulls – meaning the developer attracts investors to a new cryptocurrency project but then pulls out before the project is built.Crypto investors will be scrutinizing the Federal Open Market Committee’s latest interest rate decision on Wednesday, with expectations running high for a fourth consecutive 75 basis point hike. They have become more optimistic over the past week the U.S. central bank will tamp down its hawkishness early next year – or even before – amid faint signs that the economy may not be headed into a steep recession, although a number of major investment banks have diverged from this view.In a note on Telegram, digital asset fund QCP Capital noted “markets shifting expectations towards a dovish outcome at the upcoming meeting,” but also its concerns “about a negative market reaction to persistent hawkishness from the Fed.”Kaiko’s Carey said that Fed silence on interest rate retrenchment “could be a roadblock in the ongoing rally” for BTC.",2022/11/01
568,"Elon Musk is now “Chief Twit” after taking Twitter private last week, and the transition period seems as wracked with uncertainty as the months-long buyout negotiations. Musk, who is also CEO of Tesla and of SpaceX, has brought on a number of advisers with familiar faces in the crypto industry as he looks to revamp the social media platform and turn it profitable.Although the world’s richest man didn’t mention crypto among the reasons for doling out $44 billion to take Twitter off the public markets, there are real indications that Twitter is edging towards Web3.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.Binance helped finance the buyout and the crypto exchange’s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, is stepping up as an adviser. That’s alongside Andreessen Horowitz general partner Sriram Krishnan, a known crypto enthusiast, and member of the PayPal mafia David Sacks, who isn’t allergic to bitcoin either.Musk's buyout is ""a chance to take a prestigious Web2 platform and use it as a sandbox to start taking apart some of the challenges that we've seen become synthetical in the Web2 space,"" Binance Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann said on CoinDesk TV. He told the tech blog Protocol the buyout is a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.""Testing crypto at such a commercial scale would reveal much about the benefits and limitations of blockchain tech. Musk is apparently taking former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s advice to heart and mulling the idea of open-sourcing Twitter’s code.But what exactly would a crypto-fied Twitter look like? Right now, the biggest effect Musk’s takeover has had on crypto has been to send dogecoin skywards. Even Zhao’s comments on “bringing social media and Web3 together” were geared towards “broaden[ing] the use and adoption of crypto.”See more: Elon Musk Tweet Sparks Flurry of Twitter-Themed Dogecoin TokensTwitter – which is consistently unprofitable, wrecked by scammers and facilitates the spread of fake news – surely could trial crypto solutions. Here are the most likely:One of Musk’s earliest proposals was to turn its “blue check” verification system into a paid product. Users, if they want to continue being verified, would pay upwards of $20 a month to keep their checkmarks. Bloomberg noted that, with 424,000 verified accounts, Twitter could see an additional $102 million in revenue (if all subscribe).The idea has been roundly mocked by journalists, who’ve noted that verification isn’t a status symbol people should pay for but a tool for public safety. Account verification helps mitigate the spread of misinformation and the chance that someone would fall for a scam run by a fake account impersonating people like Elon Musk.An alternative here is to open verification to anyone, but use non-fungible tokens (NFT) to create tiers of accounts. Non-fungible tokens, being immutable, have the benefit of cutting down on fake users, adding a layer of authenticity to bolster security. The vain among us could pay for some super-expressive, feature-granting token, while Twitter could continue giving out badges to public figures.This is already happening, to some extent, with Twitter’s existing NFT strategy. The company could pull a Reddit and refer to tokens as something else, given how tarnished the term NFT has become due to bros on Twitter. In time, assuming Web3 takes off, NFT identities could be interoperable between sites. That means if you’re verified on Twitter, you would be verified wherever.Decentralized identity unlocks a lot of potential across the web, including in advertisements. As unserious as “Chief Twit” seems, Musk is looking to bolster Twitter’s ad business (which currently accounts for just under 90% of its revenue). Decentralized identities, whether NFT-based or otherwise, could help advertisers target the “highly relevant” form of ads Musk wants while preserving user’s autonomy over their data.Last week, Lit Protocol’s David Sneider wrote about the process for CoinDesk, noting that most websites today use “conversions” to determine revenue. Essentially, Twitter has software that knows when users click on an ad, as well as software that follows them from page to page and knows when they purchase something. That “last-click” attribution earns Twitter more money.A more ethical model would allow for users to opt out, know how their data is being used and manage it themselves. Using verifiable credentials, advertisers and Twitter could still track click-through rates, but would need to ask for permission to decrypt any information a user requires. This might cut down on bulk ad revenue but may make users more attractive to advertisers.Fortune crypto editor Jeff John Roberts wrote Monday that if Musk had a strategy while buying Twitter it was likely to turn it into a payments company. Musk told the New York Times the company will bring in $1.2 billion in payment revenue by 2028. This would happen by turning Twitter into a sort of open-source WeChat, an “everything” app in China.Payments on Twitter make sense – especially if you need to transact with someone you only interact with while on the app. Before stepping down, Dorsey already paved the way for this by introducing Bitcoin Lightning (though tradition fiat payments work, too).Roberts theorized Twitter’s crypto payments platform could look a little like Facebook’s failed Libra project (with more success, one hopes). Libra also wanted to combine the network effects of social media with a currency independent of government management.Musk already purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin at Tesla and could put it on Twitter’s balance sheet, too. This would be for all the same reasons as before: portfolio diversification. Although MicroStrategy, the ur-company to have bought bitcoin as an inflation hedge, is underwater with its BTC holdings, Tesla has profited.Finally, Musk is considering reviving Vine, the short-form video platform that Twitter mothballed years ago. At least part of the reason Vine failed was because its biggest creators started to demand payment for their work. Crypto micropayments experiments have yet to take off, but the idea is sound enough: Reward people for posting on or interacting with your platform.Although not everyone is into the idea of financializing every aspect of social media, it could be tried as an opt-in feature across Twitter or Vine. Maybe at first the program would be subsidized, and in time switch to a proof-of-stake system that rewards token holders.See also: Elon Musk Shouldn't Lead Twitter | OpinionWho knows what’s coming?

569,"This year’s strength of the dollar has been a key factor in keeping elevated U.S. inflation from rising even faster. Federal Reserve officials, meeting behind closed doors this week in Washington, D.C., have been far more focused on why consumer prices are rising than forces that might mitigate the pain.But if global currency markets were to turn, Fed officials might get a rude awakening because a falling dollar puts a new and unwelcome source of upward pressure on inflation. The foreign-exchange factor could also represent a new threat to prices for risky assets, from stocks to bitcoin.Because of the strong dollar, U.S. imports have become cheaper, in turn benefiting U.S. consumers. And that’s a big deal, because the U.S. is by far the biggest importer in the world, with a trade deficit of $67.4 billion in August alone.A government-produced index of U.S. import prices (excluding food and fuel) has fallen by 1.8% since April – even with the main inflation rate close to a four-decade high, currently above 8%. Industrial supplies, building materials and non-electrical machinery all got cheaper to import in September, according to the Labor Department.So it stands to reason that if other currencies were to start rising against the dollar, imports would suddenly become a lot more expensive for U.S. consumers. The result would be a new inflationary pressure that the Fed has not had to contend with for most of this year.“If the dollar weakens, that will be inflationary,” former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told CoinDesk.One question is whether such a development might, to some extent, limit the Federal Reserve’s ability to pivot toward a more dovish monetary policy – a possibility that some central bankers have hinted at in recent weeks.It matters for the bitcoin (BTC) market because bitcoin has proven to be inversely correlated with the dollar, and also hit hard by tighter Fed monetary policy. The largest cryptocurrency is down 58% this year, while the U.S. Dollar Index has climbed 16%.If a Fed pivot toward a softer stance were to result in a weaker dollar, and that in turn led to inflationary pressures, then the U.S. central bank might have to keep interest rates higher for longer – potentially an overhang for the bitcoin market.Other countries, including major Group of Seven economies, have already been experiencing the reverse side of their own weaker currencies. Inflation in the European Union just hit a fresh high of 10.7% in October as energy prices surged 41.9% from a year ago; it goes without saying that many crucial commodities like oil are priced in U.S. dollars.Signals from traditional markets suggest that a Fed softening might be in the offing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note is poised to fall below that of the three-year note – sometimes an indication that a recession is coming. If slower economic activity were to cause the Fed to cut interest rates, to soften the landing and minimize job losses, the dollar would ostensibly become less attractive – since yields would likely drop, and global investors would have less incentive to buy U.S. fixed-income investments; demand for greenbacks would fall.According to at least one prominent economist, an expected rate increase next month by the Fed could be its last for a while.“We see a decent chance that core inflation and wage growth will slow at the same time, more or less, making it much more likely that the Fed’s final hike will be in December,” Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note on Sunday.Markets still see the federal funds rate peaking at 4.9% in the summer of next year, up from about 3% now. And based on the latest projections of Fed officials, the main interest rate could rise to 4.6% by the end of next year.So the dollar might continue to enjoy tailwinds for a while.But if not, the Fed might discover once again that, in the current economic environment, when one inflationary pressure subsides, another one suddenly arrives.",2022/11/01

The filings come less than three months after the firm announced a $300 million venture capital fund, a notably short turnaround time during a bear market.The new CoinFund Seed IV fund is split into three parts –  two domiciled in the Cayman Islands and one in Delaware, which is typically done for legal and tax purposes. The Caymans funds are targeting to raise $130 million and $20 million, respectively, while the Delaware fund seeks to raise $100 million. The first sales have yet to occur, meaning the funds hadn’t opened to investors.CoinFund didn't respond to a request for comment by publication time.In August, the firm launched the $300 million CoinFund Ventures I fund to invest in crypto companies gaining commercial traction in a sector with a large total addressable market, David Pakman, CoinFund managing partner and venture investing head, told CoinDesk at the time.Founded in 2015, CoinFund originally focused on bitcoin (BTC) and seed-stage investments in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects before branching out.

571,"A group of convertible bond holders of Core Scientific (CORZ), the largest bitcoin miner by computing power, is in talks with restructuring attorneys at Paul Hastings, reported Bloomberg Law, citing people with knowledge of the situation.Core said last week it was exploring strategic alternatives for raising capital, and warned that bankruptcy could be an option. The company also said it hired Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP as legal advisers and PJT Partners LP as financial advisers.The Bloomberg report Tuesday didn't specify which convertible bondholders have retained the lawyers, and said neither Core nor Paul Hastings had returned calls for comment.Core Scientific's woes reflect the depressed state of the bitcoin mining industry, with firms facing the squeeze of a bitcoin bear market and higher energy costs.

572,"Wall Street is increasingly concerned about the future of bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain. Two sell-side analysts downgraded their stock ratings this week as the London-based company faces liquidity issues during a bear market that is crushing the industry.Argo Blockchain said Monday a deal to sell $27 million of equity to fund operations had fallen through. The miner, which has been hit by low bitcoin prices and high energy costs because it doesn't have a fixed-rate electricity agreement, said it might soon have negative cash flow. That means it may be spending more than it receives on a regular basis.Investment bank Canaccord Genuity cut its rating to hold from buy, and lowered its target for the company's American Depositary Shares (ARBK) to $1 from $10. Jefferies also downgraded the company to hold from buy, and lowered the price target to $1.10 from $13. Each ADS represents 10 ordinary shares.""If indeed it can secure the financing to negotiate a power purchase agreement [PPA], we believe Argo's flagship Helios facility could be better monetized,"" Canaccord analyst Joseph Vafi told clients in a research note. ""But given current macro uncertainty and until Argo can get to the other side of where it is now, we are downgrading shares to hold,"" Vafi wrote.Meanwhile, Jefferies analyst Jonathan Petersen said that ""locking in a PPA is the most important next step for ARBK and would likely act as a positive catalyst for the stock."" In addition, Argo being able to lower its debt load would add ""significant flexibility in these volatile times,"" Petersen said in a note to clients.Argo (ARB) shares on the London Stock Exchange started plunging in early October, when the firm announced a set of strategic actions, including the sale of bitcoin mining rigs, to fulfill its obligations and execute its strategy. DA Davidson's Chris Brendler downgraded the stock to neutral in late October, along with Core Scientific (CORZ), which has also warned it is at risk of bankruptcy.The miners' stock is down about 80% since Oct. 6 to 7.25 British pence (83 U.S. cents).

578,"Risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, have recently found a footing on hopes the Federal Reserve will pivot away from jumbo interest rate hikes from December to end the so-called liquidity tightening sooner than expected, and will signal that at its Nov. 2 meeting.However, major investment banks believe the Fed could keep the doors open for continued jumbo rate hikes, and a potential switch to smaller rate hikes would not necessarily imply an early end of liquidity tightening.The Fed has raised the borrowing cost by 300 basis points (bps) this year, roiling risk assets. The central bank is expected to deliver its fourth 75 bps hike on Wednesday, lifting the borrowing cost to the 3.75%-4% range. It could signal a step down to 50 bps hike in December.The markets appear to have run ahead of themselves in pricing a slowdown in terms of both frequency and magnitude of rate hikes starting from December. Traders expect the rate hike cycle to peak at around 4.8%, down from the terminal rate of 5% priced two weeks ago, according to the futures tied to the Fed funds rate. Bitcoin has gained 10% in two weeks, while the dollar index has dropped by over 2%.Inflation remains sticky, suggesting the Fed has little room to turn dovish and halt rate hikes anytime soon, which is a negative sign for risk assets.The data released on Friday showed the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the core PCE, rose 0.5% month on month in September, the same as in August, leaving the year-on-year increase at 5.1%. That's significantly higher than the annual inflation target of 2%. Further, employment costs continue to rise at the double the rate registered over the past 15 years.The Fed could continue to hike rates at a slower pace for longer, potentially lifting borrowing costs well above the terminal rate of 4.8% priced in by markets.""The Fed will stress data dependence next week. They will get two more NFP and CPI prints before the [December] meeting; if they stay hot, another 75 bps is in the cards, if not, a deceleration to 50 bps is possible,"" strategists at Bank of America wrote in a weekly note sent to clients on Friday. ""While the market badly wants a pivot, slower doesn't mean lower.""""The Fed isn't done hiking until the data says so. Core CPI is at cycle highs, U3 unemployment is at cycle lows. Corporates tell us their top challenge is hiring. China and U.S. are decoupling. [Capital expenditure] is rising. Food and energy are increasingly scarce. Inflationary pressures seem broad-based and increasingly entrenched. Short-term survey inflation expectations have risen. The Fed's job is not done,"" strategists added.Barclays' credit research team voiced a similar opinion in the weekly note, saying a potential bias for smaller rate hikes wouldn't mark a dovish pivot in the true sense of the word.""The Fed needs to see inflation turning and labor market conditions deteriorating before turning meaningfully dovish. As such, we think it is likely to retain optionality for December, so we see limited further downside for the [U.S. dollar] and could see the broad dollar rebound this week,"" Barclays' credit research team said.A dollar rebound will likely weigh over risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin tends to move in the opposite direction of the dollar.Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG Bank, said in Tuesday's client note, ""If the Fed does slow the pace of hikes in December, it does not necessarily mean as well that the total amount of tightening delivered in the current tightening cycle will be less, although that will be the initial assumption.""""It could be that the Fed slows the pace of hikes but eventually keeps hiking for longer,"" Hardman added.Danske Bank""It is too early to turn soft for the Fed, and we look for a 75 bps hike and hawkish communication. Fed to hike by another 150 bps this year, then stop.""ING""While we may well get a 'stepdown' in the pace of tightening from December onwards, it is clear that inflation is far from defeated, and the risks are that rate hikes could continue for longer.""SEB group""We expect Fed Chair [Jerome] Powell to repeat that policy is data dependent and will be decided on a meeting-by-meeting basis, but also that it, at some point, likely would be appropriate to slow the pace of increases, thus keeping all options on the table for December, when the FOMC will release new economic and rate forecasts.""",2022/11/01
579,"A new class of Shiba Inu-inspired tokens was birthed on BNB Chain and Ethereum Tuesday following a related tweet by technology billionaire Elon Musk.Names like “babyDogeTwitter,” “dogenaldtrump,” “spaceTwitterDoge,” and “elonDogeTwit,” populated the two blockchains after Musk tweeted an image of a Shiba Inu dog wearing a Twitter T-shirt in front of a classic Halloween pumpkin with the social media platform’s bird logo etched on the side of it.Blockchain security firm PeckShield said in a tweet in Asian afternoon hours that over 67 of such tokens fell 90% in the hours following their issuance, with 45 tokens falling 100%. This cumulatively led to losses of thousands of dollars among investors who punted on the newly issued tokens in hopes of a long-term price appreciation.Over 42 tokens were marked by PeckShield as honeypots, a term that describes illicit tokens that change permissions on unsuspecting users’ crypto wallets, with the goal of eventually transferring all their crypto tokens out of those wallets into one controlled by a scammer.Musk’s tweet also sparked off a rally in dogecoin, which jumped over 14 cents to gain more than 23% in the past 24 hours. Floki Inu, another Shiba Inu-themed token, also surged by a similar figure, while Shiba Inu’s SHIB tokens jumped 8%.Such irrational exuberance came amid a relatively flat crypto market, with bitcoin and ether rising nominally in the past 24 hours.Musk has been a major supporter of DOGE, which has become a proxy for sentiment about him. The entrepreneur's statements about the token have also consistently influenced its price, as previously reported.Dogecoin has been on a run ever since Musk confirmed his takeover of Twitter last week, with the token’s futures racking up over $90 in liquidations over the weekend in an unusual move. The DOGE price doubled in October, the best performance among the 150 digital assets in the CoinDesk Market Index.",2022/11/01
580,"Give that DOGE a bone.Dogecoin (DOGE), the canine-inspired meme token often associated with electric-vehicle-tycoon-turned-Twitter-owner Elon Musk, was the top performer in October among the 150 digital assets in the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI).The DOGE price rose 101% during the month, vastly outpacing the 7% climb in the CMI overall. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, was up 5.5% on the month, while ether (ETH) gained 18%.Digital-asset analysts attributed the big jump in DOGE to Musk’s dramatic $44 billion takeover of Twitter – ostensibly tied to speculation that the deal might somehow, eventually, bring value or utility to the Dogecoin blockchain and its eponymous cryptocurrency.During a May 2021 appearance on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” Musk used the line, “Call me the Dogefather.” And in January 2021, Musk used Twitter to send out an image of himself holding up a Shiba Inu puppy – the dog breed that inspired dogecoin.Musk at one point suggested – perhaps in jest, perhaps not – charging 0.1 DOGE per tweet. Dogecoin rose “on the back of excitement over Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter,” the digital-asset investment fund QCP Capital wrote Monday in a note on Telegram. “Musk's tweets have created price swings in the past, even suggesting using DOGE as payment for a Twitter subscription.”Katie Talati, head of research at crypto asset-management firm Arca Funds, said dogecoin’s recent trading spikes “have very much been speculation-driven,” similar to last year’s frenzy in meme stocks.“It's the same way as people trading GameStop and AMC,” Talati said. “It’s a token that drove a lot of retail interest.”Among the CMI index constituents, Mask Network’s MASK token was the second-best performer in October, with a 96% return, followed by the decentralized crypto exchange SushiSwap’s SUSHI token, which surged 45%. SushiSwap’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) approved a restructuring last week.Ether’s monthly return was fueled partly by a short squeeze last week. The cryptocurrency has benefited from fresh speculation following the Ethereum blockchain’s Merge last month, which shifted the network to a more energy-efficient “proof-of-stake” network. The change also drastically reduced the pace at which the blockchain is producing new tokens – implying less overall supply.Bitcoin’s return during the month was more muted, but bulls were enthused by its price jump above $20,000 for the first time in 18 days.Talati attributed ETH’s outperformance over BTC to “market structure,” given that more traders had been betting against ETH than BTC – and not an indication of“anything fundamentally shifting.”“Bitcoin doesn't really have a strong narrative right now, whereas ETH still does have the Merge narrative,” she said.Rally (RLY), an ERC-20 token, was the biggest loser in the CMI, falling 33% in October.The insolvent crypto lending platform Celsius Network’s native token CEL lost 27%, amid reports that its former CEO, Alex Mashinsky, withdrew $10 million in the weeks before the company froze customer accounts.Another big loser was Terra Luna Classic’s LUNC token, which also lost 31% during the month – potentially dashing hopes among traders who had hoped for a recovery following the network’s collapse in May.LUNA, the native coin of the Terra 2.0 blockchain, the fork that emerged from Terra Classic, slid around 1% during the month. Its controversial co-founder, Do Kwon, denied claims in October that he is on the run from law enforcement, despite Interpol issuing a “red notice” for his arrest in September. Earlier this month, Terra’s developers attempted to revive the LUNA ecosystem and increase user activity with the token.What’s ahead in November? Talati said the World Cup could spark interest in sports-fan tokens like Chiliz (CHZ), from “the advertising perspective.”She said she “wouldn't be surprised” to see crypto ads on banners around the stadium during matches – similar to Coinbase putting up a QR code in an ad during the Super Bowl in February.Dogecoin likely will continue to ride waves of speculation. “At the end of the day, there aren't like financial applications built on top of it,” Talati said.",2022/11/01

DOGE, which was created to mock the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, spiked late last week as billionaire entrepreneur and DOGE advocate Elon Musk neared the completion of his $44 billion purchase of Twitter. Over the past four days Musk has asserted his control over the social media platform. On Monday, he ousted Twitter’s nine-person board.As CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams wrote, DOGE’s price fluctuations seem to stem from the power of Musk’s personality and a passionate dogecoin community than the macroeconomic indicators that have been influencing bitcoin, ether and other cryptos over the past 12 months. DOGE’s rise may correlate with excessive liquidations and a likely short squeeze, and the token may offer a shorting opportunity, Williams wrote.Bitcoin (BTC) spent Monday in the red and was recently down about 0.8% from Sunday, same time, although the largest cryptocurrency by market value remained comfortably over the $20,000 perch it assumed last week. Ether was down similarly over the same period and was changing hands above the $1,500 level that the second-largest crypto assumed a week ago.""Some traders are growing confident that a bottom is in place, options market activity is showing the need for downside protection is easing,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda.

Investors will be eyeing the latest Federal Open Market Committee interest rate hike, which is widely expected to be a robust 75 basis points.By James RubinHong Kong's Fintech Association chairman offered a rousing endorsement of a policy statement suggesting that retail investors would have more access to digital assets and seemed to point the city in a more crypto friendly direction.""Now Hong Kong is back inside of the game, Neil Tan, who is also CEO of the blockchain startup Neptune Digital, told The Daily Forkast in an interview. ""And that retail piece does play a huge piece. If you look at the exchanges and market capitalizations, a lot of it drives from the retail side.""In the policy statement released Monday at Hong Kong FinTech Week, the government's main financial agency, the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau (FSTB), indicated it would conduct a public consultation on how retail investors might attain a “suitable degree of access to virtual assets"" to licensed exchanges. The FSTB said it was reconsidering its stance on virtual asset exchange traded funds (ETF) and tokenized securities, and that it was “ready to engage” with global virtual asset service providers and invite them to the city.Earlier this year, as part of a move to tighten anti-money laundering regulations, the Hong Kong government moved to license virtual asset service providers (VASP) via a legislative proposal that passed its consultation period. The city's main securities regulatory group, Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), would be provided with ""necessary intervention powers"" to impose restrictions or even prohibitions on companies providing crypto services.Institutional interestTan also noted the desire for more institutions ""to have more coverage into digital assets,"" and he praised the timing of the policy statement's release.""You're introducing it inside the winter, so there's little risk in terms of downside,"" he said. ""There's a lot more upside. Everybody else has shown their cards such as Dubai and also Singapore in terms of what the regulatory framework will look like in these jurisdictions.""He added: ""Hong Kong is in a strong position.

We want to to go to the NBA final and win a championship.""11:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(3:30 UTC) Reserve Bank of Australia's Interest Rate Decision10:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(14:00 UTC) Institute for Supply Management's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (Oct)5:45 a.m. HKT/SGT(21:45 UTC) New Zealand Employment Changes (Q3)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Remains Steady, Dogecoin Futures Rack up Nearly $90M in LiquidationsBitcoin held above $20,500 as the crypto community observes the fourteenth birthday of the cryptocurrency's white paper.

583,"Technical TakeCrypto markets fell on the final day of October, with bitcoin (BTC) declining 1.2% and ether (ETH) falling 1.8%. The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization ended the month up 5% and 17%, respectively.Dogecoin (DOGE), the Shibu-Inu themed meme coin, led all gainers for October, rising 102%, about 90% of which occurred during the last week. DOGE remains a top 10 cryptocurrency by market capitalization at approximately $15.6 billion.Unlike BTC and ETH, whose fortunes appear tied to macroeconomic factors, burn rates and centralized exchange balances, dogecoin’s appeal appears to stem from community, personality (Elon Musk) and the opportunity for outsized gains within a rapid period of time.This week, crypto investors will be weighing a range of economic indicators. In the U.S. the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces its latest interest rate decision, a widely expected 75 basis point increase. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its latest jobs data while the Institute for Supply Management issues its October manufacturing report.Yet, dogecoin will likely remain more affected by the utterances and actions of newly minted Twitter owner, billionaire and DOGE advocate Elon Musk.DOGE supporters may view their investments as a sub-$1 vote of confidence in Musk’s business acumen, which has significant upside and limited downside.The correlation coefficients for DOGE compared with bitcoin and ether are 0.78 and 0.85, respectively. Correlation coefficients range from 1 to -1, with the former indicating a direct pricing relationship and the latter signaling a completely inverse relationship.So despite seemingly being driven by different factors, DOGE maintains a surprisingly strong correlation to both BTC and ETH.Unusual weekend activity in DOGE appears to depart from its more traditional counterparts, despite their correlations.While Saturday trading volume for BTC and ETH fell within normal ranges, DOGE volume was eight times more than its 20-day moving average on the day. Sharp price increases in conjunction with high volume are often a bullish sign for an asset.DOGE’s increase came in conjunction with excessive liquidations, and a likely short squeeze, which may also give investors pause. The recent run-up may also make DOGE an attractive short candidate for traders who do not believe in the price move. For those of that mindset, a potential price target may be at 7 cents where significant past trading activity has occurred.DOGE is also trading 60% higher than its 20-day moving average, and has pushed significantly past the upper range of its Bollinger Bands, which sat at the approximately 7 cents mark prior to the Twitter acquisition.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for DOGE is showing as significantly overbought now at 88.60, its highest reading since April 2021.",2022/10/31
584,"A mountain of crypto riches can’t automatically purchase a seat in Congress. But for many campaigns winding their way toward the U.S. midterm election next week, it certainly doesn’t hurt.This year’s elections mark the first wave of races in which industry donations not only rose to significant levels but, with well over $80 million in play, it actually reached a level occupied by other U.S. industries famous for their political clout – such as health care, energy and Wall Street itself.Still, crypto’s campaign largesse didn’t assure victories during the primaries, as demonstrated by the flameout of Oregon congressional candidate Carrick Flynn after a single industry source spent nearly $1,000 for every vote he landed. Or consider the New York contest in which one of the industry’s chief Washington advocates, Michelle Bond, couldn’t muster one-third of the vote despite courting endorsements from Donald Trump Jr. and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).Campaigns for the general election are in their final days as they press toward the Nov. 8 vote. While crypto interests may have wasted money in some noteworthy cases, they also managed to add serious dollars to close primary races that went their way.One of the strategies of the industry’s most widely funded political action committee, according to an analysis of federal campaign records, was to support candidates in districts or states in which party dominance would already settle the general election. The political hopefuls supported by GMI PAC were often younger candidates seeking seats vacated by older lawmakers who retired or sought other offices.Overall, a lot of the industry money – when factoring in the conservative PACs with GMI’s more balanced approach – went to crypto-sympathetic Republicans. Friends in the GOP could serve the industry well because Republicans are expected to take over the House majority.“The balance of probabilities heavily favors the Republicans netting the five seats necessary to take control of the House,” said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at BTIG, a financial-services firm. They also have a chance to seize the Senate, though that remains a tougher path.Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of crypto exchange FTX, and fellow FTX executive Ryan Salame have drawn the most attention this year as campaign ATMs, with Bankman-Fried surging to become the country’s fourth-largest individual donor, according to campaign-finance analytical site OpenSecrets.org. That means he’s sandwiched between giants of U.S. investing – Ken Griffin of Citadel at No. 3 and Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International Group at No. 5. Yass is also a major donor for the crypto cause.Much of the crypto industry’s giving is funneled through a small number of PACs that amassed major war chests. They typically spend the money on “independent expenditures” – the way a committee can spend unlimited amounts on ads to support a candidate without directly contributing money. Total ad spending is projected to approach $10 billion for the midterms, according to tracking firm AdImpact.Two of the biggest PACs – Bankman-Fried’s Protect our Future and Salame’s American Dream Federal Action – are propped up almost entirely by the FTX executives. Bankman-Fried’s is easily the largest, having given $28 million. However, despite the CEO’s lofty position in the digital-assets industry, he says that’s not what his election involvement is about, leaving the political world confused about whether his candidates even have any private thoughts about crypto.At a recent event in Washington, he said he wants “a culture of bipartisan constructive compromise and progress as opposed to partisan bickering.” But more specifically, he favors candidates who will prevent devastation from future pandemics. He said he’s supporting “people who will make sure to follow through on common sense things to try to not have what happened to us over the last few years happen again, except maybe way more deadly.”With Bankman-Fried on that unrelated crusade, it may be FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Salame (No. 11 among the nation’s individual donors) who wins the title of the industry’s most prolific campaign contributor trying to shape digital-assets policy with his money. Salame’s PAC has been backing Republican candidates such as Alabama's Katie Britt, who is expected to win a Senate seat next month and arrive in Washington, D.C., supportive of crypto causes.With the crypto PAC supplying her almost $2 million in ad support, Alabama Republicans voted for Britt to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Richard Shelby, for whom she had served as chief of staff. Though Senate races such as hers are high-dollar affairs, the $2 million the PAC spent – according to available Federal Election Commission filings up to Sept. 30 – was equal to about a fifth of her overall direct campaign contributions from donors.Britt, who is expected to coast through the general election in that GOP stronghold, has promised “staunch support” on Capitol Hill for the crypto industry.“Supporting bitcoin means supporting personal freedom, American competitiveness and national security,” Britt said on her campaign website.The PAC also boosted Brad Finstad (R-Minn.), a former Trump administration official who is the favorite to beat his Democratic opponent in Minnesota for a House seat. Finstad, who already won a special election this year to finish an incomplete term, hasn’t made crypto a plank in his campaign platform, but Salame’s group spent nearly $2 million on him earlier this year.Apart from the FTX executives’ groups, the crypto industry has several others PACs. Two of the biggest are the Crypto Freedom PAC, a group backed by Yass and the conservative Club for Growth that’s deployed about $5 million so far this year, and GMI – which took in $12 million in this cycle and funds other industry PACs, including Web3 Forward and Crypto Innovation.GMI is bankrolled by prominent industry names, including the founders of venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Circle Internet Financial, the FTX executives and many others, and its two affiliated PACs each focus on one of the political parties.In one of the 15 primary wins GMI helped secure for candidates this year, it backed Jonathan Jackson, an Illinois businessman and college professor who is the son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jackson, a rare congressional candidate who not only mentions crypto but has included it among the top issues of his campaign, was supported by almost $500,000 in ad buys. That amount rivals the money his campaign received in direct contributions.“While 15 seats is a great start, it takes more than a single election cycle to truly effect change in Washington,” said Michael Carcaise, a strategist for GMI. He added that “seats up and down the ballot – including the race for president – are very much on our radar, not just in 2024 but for at least the next decade.”The conservative Crypto Freedom PAC also threw support to Blake Masters, a Republican Senate candidate in Arizona and one of the most prominent crypto candidates in the midterms. Masters, the chief operating officer at billionaire and PayPal (PYPL) co-founder Peter Thiel’s venture-capital firm, has spoken about the need for crypto’s innovations to go up against what he describes as a corrupt banking system.Polling has been showing that Arizona seat to be among the tightest election battles on the map. It’s one of the handful of races that will decide the majority of the Senate and potentially whether the Republicans control Congress entirely next year.To be sure, some industry donations have also gone to veteran lawmakers who are likely to have an outsized role in crypto policy. Those include Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the potential next chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and who has been negotiating a possible stablecoin oversight bill, and Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.), one of the authors of major crypto legislation in the Senate Agriculture Committee.Though the industry has barely gotten its feet wet in politics, it already learned some major cautionary lessons about investing in novice candidates. In Oregon, Flynn didn’t have any apparent crypto position, but his major backer was one of the industry’s biggest names. Bankman-Fried’s PAC provided more than $10 million to fill every household in the district with his name.The candidate who beat Flynn – an established legislator who served in the Democratic leadership of the Oregon House of Representatives – won twice as many votes from people in the district who were reportedly bewildered by the sudden ubiquity of the remarkably well-funded stranger.The race for that district – in an interesting side note – also included Matt West, a decentralized finance (DeFi) developer who largely bankrolled his own campaign, but he came in sixth out of nine Democratic candidates. It was Bankman-Fried’s COVID-19 pandemic interests that assured his opponent, Flynn, got the support instead of the digital-assets veteran in that race.“We thought it was worth increasing the chances of someone with genuine pandemic prevention expertise being elected to Congress,” said Mike Levine, a spokesman for the Protect Our Future PAC.To a lesser extent, Salame’s American Dream Federal Action PAC also lost a major bet on a Republican candidate when Rep. Davis Rodney (R-Ill.) was badly beaten in the primaries by a candidate favored by former President Donald Trump. The PAC devoted more than $2 million trying to get Rodney re-elected.Political giving has “been a little bit of a mixed bag” in these early days, said Kristin Smith, who runs the Blockchain Association in Washington, which has recently started its own PAC. But she noted the “huge shift” from just a few years ago, when crypto insiders were still resistant to engaging with politicians. She said that changed when the industry was blindsided by crypto tax provisions in a bill last year.Winning and losing may not be the main point to the industry’s new involvement in U.S. political campaigns. Just tallying up the congressional election victories “misses the forest for the trees,” said Boltansky. The more important point is that the crypto field is making itself known as a significant political force.“The industry will have the relationships and standing necessary to engage with policymakers the next time we see either a bad bill or a harmful proposal,” Boltansky said. That’s meaningful going into this next congressional session, when “there could be some actual movement on targeted measures like the stablecoin bill.”",2022/10/31
585,"Across the world, people are losing trust in the institutions that underpin society. Any thinking person can see the institutions of governance, finance and money are corrupt, incompetent and yet unavoidable.As a result, the world is in a continued state of crisis, gyrating from one emergency to another with ever increasing speed and volatility. Progress and growth are stagnant. Hate, nihilism and pessimism are culturally dominant.Edan Yago is the founder of Sorvyn. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.The failings of our institutions are many but the root cause is the same: monopoly power.We all know that monopolies are bad for everyone except the company concentrating power. Yet, when it comes to the greatest monopoly of all, the state, we somehow forget commonsense. Why? Because we assume there is no alternative. Of course a singular entity must oversee the law, and control violence within its borders.Until very recently this assumption was warranted, but on Jan. 3, 2009, Satoshi released Bitcoin and showed us an alternative. He showed it is possible to build a system of rules without an administrator. He showed that this can be applied to the most fundamental institution of property and law: the institution of money.Bitcoin showed that all users can be superusers and that admins are not necessary at all.See also: Why Satoshi Chose Halloween to Release the Bitcoin White Paper | OpinionWhat Bitcoin demonstrated in the domain of money, tokens have since demonstrated for other types of digital property. More recently, decentralized finance (DeFi) is calling into question the need for admins in financial services. Web3 (or 5, if you prefer) is likewise an effort to eliminate the need for internet services to be monopolies as well.We are part of the most historically radical revolution in human affairs and few seem to grasp the full magnitude of what is happening. The endpoint of this revolution is that we will finally rid ourselves of the most dangerous and destructive monopoly of them all – the monopoly that backstops all other monopolies – the monopoly of the state.Since most people do not comprehend the final destination, we are taking many wrong turns along the way. “I’m in it for the tech” or “blockchain not Bitcoin” say those who see just another Silicon Valley-style tech disruption. They are distracted and obsessed with features instead of principles, inviting the admins back into power, to eke out faster transactions or greater throughput.One of the most brilliant aspects of Bitcoin’s design was that it is a tool for liberty, dressed up as a get-rich-quick scheme. Much of “crypto” has perversely turned this on its head, pumping out get-rich-quick schemes dressed up as tools for economic freedom.Apart from crypto, “bitcoiners” also frequently fail to properly identify the historic moment. From a reliance on centralized services, to the commonly held hope for institutional adoption, most traders and many HODLers are more interested in ""number go up"" than on ""authorities brought down.""For all the conviction of token Bitcoin maximalism, it too misses the point. Its central tenet is that no other tokens, besides BTC, should exist. This is monopolist thinking applied to Bitcoin. The result is a myopic focus on money as the root of all evil. A belief that we can fix all problems, if we simply fix the money.Money, if it is the root of all evil, is antithetical to Bitcoin. There's been thousands of years of anti-market thinking, stretching back at least as far as Jesus smashed the merchants and money-changers. The corruption of money is a serious problem, but even the most casual reflection on human history makes clear that it is not the only problem, or even the most serious.Some of the most cruel and totalitarian regimes existed on a gold standard. Sound money didn’t prevent the slave trade, the proscriptions of Augusts or the innumerable massacres that occurred in between. Human history is the story of gang violence and mob bosses. Fixing money is a heroic start to fixing the corruption of monopoly power, but shouldn’t be confused for a universal miracle cure.In a boastful moment, the Roman General Pompeius Magnus, declared “I have only to stamp my foot, and legions will spring up all over Italy”. This is how humanity's mob bosses have for centuries run the world, through their ability to call forth physical power, loyal to them.Then along came Satoshi, the boss of no one, who clicked his mouse and legions of miners sprang up all over the world, loyal to encode rules and function, not men. Satoshi showed us that a decentralized consensus mechanism can call forth and coordinate power in the real world.Take this to its logical conclusion and it becomes clear that we can, and will, replace mob bosses and central admins with leaderless consensus rules. We might not rid ourselves completely of violence, power and policing but we no longer need a state monopoly in charge to prevent a slide into chaos.We, the legions loyal to Satoshi’s ideas, will construct new institutions of governance that are based on voluntary participation and free market incentives. These institutions, blockchains, decentralized autonomous organization (DAOs) and P2P networks, will be the opposite of monopolies; they will compete for users and members.We will be masters of code, rather than the other way round. We will construct a world where, just like BTC, all property will be cryptographically proven, enforced and immutable. To do so, we will build systems that incentivize and coordinate decentralized “police.”The world will replace the state with Nakamoto consensus, not because it is the right thing to do but because it is the lucrative thing to do. Half the world’s gross domestic product (GDP) is controlled by governments. Once we realize we can do to government what we are doing to money, the game theory will play out on its own. The next Bitcoin-sized asymmetric bet, after sound money and sound finance, is sound governance. Get in early.Like Prometheus, Satoshi gave fire and left. Its flame lights the way to the next phase of human civilization. We will cast aside the central powers that monopolize sovereignty. With them gone, none will be our masters but ourselves.",2022/10/31
586,"“I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.” Those were the words pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto used to greet the world some 14 years ago in an email releasing the Bitcoin white paper.To this day, nobody still knows who Satoshi is. Since April 23, 2011, nobody has heard from him/her/them after they signed off an email saying,A technical description, the Bitcoin white paper was the first document to outline the principles of a cryptographically secured, trustless, peer-to-peer electronic payment system that was fundamentally designed to be transparent and censorship-resistant, as well as put financial control back in the hands of the individual. At that time, the world was gripped by a financial crisis catalyzed by excessive speculation in the financial markets and banks risking millions of dollars worth of depositors' money.This document lay the foundation for what is generally considered the first functional digital currency powered by a distributed ledger technology called blockchain.One of the many ground-breaking elements of Satoshi’s electronic payment system was that it solved the long-standing “double-spend” problem that plagued cashless spending. Through the implementation of time-stamped transactions that are unanimously verified by a distributed network of validators, it was no longer possible for a person to spend the same funds twice.The white paper was released under an MIT public license in 2008 for all to learn from, share and enjoy.

588,"The options market tracking bitcoin (BTC) suggests that the once-overwhelming fear of an extended slide has subsided, a sign that the worst may be over for the price of the cryptocurrency.For the first time since March, both long-term and short-term skews have climbed to zero, which indicates that the demand for puts or downside protection relative to calls or bullish bets has weakened. Skew measures the spread between the implied volatility of calls and puts.A call option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put option gives the right to sell. Implied volatility refers to expectations for price turbulence over a particular period and is influenced by demand for options.So, a positive call-put skew indicates greater demand for calls, while a negative skew implies bias for puts. A neutral or near zero skew is a sign the demand for bullish and bearish bets is balanced.""The market sentiment has returned to neutral after a long time,"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset-management firm Blofin, told CoinDesk. ""That's one of the important signals that the market may have found a bottom.""The 30-, 90- and 180-day skews have returned to near zero for the first time since late March/early April. The 60-day skew has turned marginally positive, a hint of a bias for calls expiring in two months.The sentiment has flipped from negative to neutral amid hopes that the Federal Reserve will slow down its pace of monetary tightening starting in December. The Fed has raised rates by 300 basis points this year in an effort to control inflation, putting risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, under pressure.""Suppose the Fed eventually chooses to ease monetary policy gradually. In that case, we may witness a gradual recovery in the market in recent months,"" Ardern said.The Fed is likely to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday and signal a step down to 50 basis points in December.That said, it's still too early to bet on a price rally by purchasing call options, according to options analytics firm Genesis Volatility.""Spot prices DO INDEED look constructively bullish … but that said, Q4-22 doesn’t resemble the Q4-20 environment, where buying call exposure was the right move to make,"" Gregoire Magadini, CEO of Genesis Volatility, said in a weekly newsletter.

589,"Argo Blockchain's (ARB) said a deal to raise 24 million British pounds (US$27 million) from a strategic investor has fallen through, sending the bitcoin mining company's shares tumbling as much as 72%.The London-based firm, which earlier this month signed a letter of intent to sell 87 million shares to the investor as it looked to ease liquidity pressures, didn't say why the agreement had been called off. It is working to secure other deals to provide working capital for the next 12 months.""Should Argo be unsuccessful in completing any further financing, Argo would become cash flow negative in the near term and would need to curtail or cease operations,"" it said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange.The bitcoin mining industry is at a critical moment as it battles soaring energy prices coupled with the stagnated value of cryptocurrencies.

590,"Smart contract platform Ethereum's recent technological overhaul is beginning to have an intended bullish effect on its native token ether's (ETH) price.ETH rose over 16% in the seven days to Oct. 30, its best weekly percentage price gain since mid-July, overshadowing bitcoin's (BTC) 5% rise, CoinDesk data show.""Both major coins are having their moment, but since people are still adjusting to ether's recent tokenomics changes, momentum is still stronger there for now,"" Jordi Alexander, chief investment officer at proprietary trading firm Seleni Capital, said.On Sept. 15, Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism from a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism, replacing miners with validators, who explicitly lock capital in the form of ETH on the platform as entities responsible for confirming transactions.Since the switch, ether's supply has increased by 1,300 tokens. The net-supply increase would have been more than 481,000 had the blockchain continued to use the PoW mechanism.Ether's net issuance, also known as annualized inflation rate, has declined from 3.6% to nearly 0%, falling below bitcoin's 1.7%, according to data sourced from ultrasound.money.Meanwhile, data from blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock shows ether's net issuance has actually declined below zero. In other words, ether has turned deflationary – a coin with supply decreasing over time instead of increasing. That's at a time when investors worldwide are facing a shortage of assets that could protect their money from rampant inflation.The ether-bitcoin ratio, measuring ether's price in bitcoin terms, rose 10% last week, registering the biggest gain since July. The ratio's uptrend could continue, according to prominent traders.""Ether may continue to outperform bitcoin as ETH's annual issuance continues to fall rapidly. Therefore, thanks to the transaction fee burn mechanism, any increase in on-chain activity should bring Ethereum firmly into deflationary issuance territory and may have a substantial outsized effect on [ether’s] price,"" Josh Olszweicz, head of research at digital asset fund manager Valkyrie Investments, told CoinDesk.Read More: Surging Popularity of Ethereum Staking Keeps Lid on YieldsIn August last year, Ethereum activated a mechanism to burn a portion of transaction fees paid in ETH by users, essentially tying the number of ETH burned or taken out of circulation with the network usage.So, as Olszweicz said, an increase in network usage will further skew demand-supply dynamics in favor of ether bulls. Since early August last year, over 2.6 million ETH worth $8.65 billion has been taken out of circulation, according to ethburned.info.Shiliang Tang, chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund Ledger Prime, said ether's deflationary appeal would get stronger overtime, attracting investors.""A lot of sidelined capital is more attracted to ETH storyline than BTC at the moment,"" Tang said. ""I expect ETH to maintain lead over BTC, as ETH's deflationary nature will slowly be felt over time.""Tang added that ""bitcoin would continue to face supply overhang from miners (more of a consistent drip of supply as opposed to large blocks) with bitcoin price here [around $20,000].""Ether's switch to PoS has permanently freed the market from daily miner selling. According to Cumberland, Ethereum miners used to sell $40 million worth of ether daily. Bitcoin continues to use the PoW mechanism, where miners solve complex algorithmic puzzles to validate transactions in return for rewards paid in BTC. Miners typically liquidate coins regularly to fund their operations.While ether's fundamentals favor a continued rally, the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to adverse macroeconomic factors.The Federal Reserve is widely expected to deliver its fourth straight 75 basis point interest rate hike on Wednesday and signal a less aggressive approach for the coming months. The expectations for the so-called Fed pivot in favor of slower tightening have brought life back to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.However, selling pressure may return if the so-called Fed pivot in favor of slower tightening is accompanied by a strong-worded message, saying rates could remain higher for longer.The Wall Street Journal's Nick Timiraos, widely considered the Fed mouthpiece, published an article over the weekend saying the central bank could holder rates higher for longer as consumers and businesses are providing less sensitive to ongoing monetary tightening. The Fed has raised rates by 300 basis points this year, roiling asset markets.",2022/10/31
591,"HONG KONG — Hong Kong’s Financial Services and Treasury Bureau issued a policy statement on virtual assets at the opening of the city's flagship tech conference Hong Kong FinTech Week on Monday.Hong Kong is “ready to engage” with global virtual asset service providers and invite them to the city, the statement says. The jurisdiction's Legislative Council is currently reviewing Hong Kong's new VASP licensing regime as part of proposed amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance. The regime is set to come into effect March 1 next year.Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will conduct a public consultation on how retail investors may be given a “suitable degree of access to virtual assets"" to licensed exchanges, according to the policy statement.Currently, retail customers can trade crypto on unlicensed exchanges such as Binance. After the VASP regime takes effect, only VASP licensed exchanges can offer any crypto services, and some might be able to offer crypto services to retail customers.The policy statement adds that Hong Kong is “open to the possibility” of having exchange-traded funds on virtual assets, pledging to enhance investor protection and ensure suitable regulatory arrangements are in place.“The SFC has been actively looking to set up a regime to authorize ETFs [that] provide exposure to mainstream virtual assets with appropriate investment guardrails,” Securities and Futures Commission Deputy Chief Executive Officer Julia Leung said at Hong Kong FinTech Week.Leung added that virtual assets futures ETFs will be subject to additional requirements related to management company, investment strategy, disclosure and investor education. In the initial stage, the underlying assets will be confined to bitcoin futures and ether futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Leung said.In her speech, Leung also announced changes to how the SFC views tokenized securities. The SFC takes the view that tokenized securities should be treated in a similar way to existing financial instruments, she said. The SFC will no longer classify tokenized securities as complex products just because they are issued on the blockchain, Leung said.If proper safeguards are put in place, the SFC is prepared to allow retail access, Leung said. The SFC is working on a circular to set out changes to the security token regime in detail.Given differences between traditional assets and virtual assets, the government is open to future review on property rights for tokenized assets and the legality of smart contracts, the statement says.“We were sometimes a bit hesitant or even resistant wondering how new creatures like crypto, stablecoins, [decentralized finance] or other blockchain-based innovations can fit into mainstream finance,” Hong Kong Monetary Authority CEO Eddie Yue said at Hong Kong FinTech Week.Yue said that it had become apparent that the technologies underpinning them will “develop very nicely in a healthy financial system like Hong Kong.”Hong Kong is exploring pilot projects on non-fungible token issuance for Hong Kong FinTech Week, green bond tokenisation and eHKD, the policy statement says.Its virtual asset ecosystem could realize use cases including trading arts and collectibles, tokenizing vintage goods and tokenizing debt securities, the statement says.",2022/10/31
592,"Dogecoin trading over the weekend saw the shiba inu-themed meme coin reach a market capitalization of over $10 billion, add over 90% in value over the past week and become one of the largest liquidators among futures that track crypto majors.Dogecoin futures racked up over $89 million in liquidations since Friday amid volatile trading as Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter was confirmed. Some $52 million of those figures originated from short traders, or bets against a token’s price rise.Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).Dogecoin liquidations were the highest among all cryptocurrencies in the past 24 hours at over $27 million. Futures tracking ether and bitcoin, which usually see the largest figures, racked up a relatively lesser $14 million and $12 million in losses respectively.The liquidations may have contributed to a short squeeze, as dogecoin prices doubled from nearly 7 cents on Friday to over 15 cents on Sunday morning. Prices retreated to 11 cents on Monday at writing time.There’s some $647 billion of open interest on dogecoin futures as of Monday. Open interest, or the number of contracts outstanding and not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade.Elsewhere, on-chain transactions on the Dogecoin system spiked from 25,000 per day last week to over 37,000 as of Monday morning, data from block explorers show.Musk has been a major supporter of DOGE, which has become a proxy for sentiment about him. The entrepreneur's statements about the token have also consistently influenced its price, as previously reported.",2022/10/31
593,"Ethereum staking appears to be the new favorite way for crypto traders to capture yield – so popular, in fact, that it’s driving the yields lower.That’s a consequence of the formula used to calculate the yields under the Ethereum blockchain’s month-old “proof-of-stake” model: The staking yields are awarded in ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. And the total amount of ether available for staking yields is divided between all the accounts that are staking. So the more ether that’s sent to the blockchain for staking, the lower the percentage that’s available for each staker.According to Coinbase Institutional, the staking yield post-Merge looks to be about 4%- 5%, well below the 9%-12% that the analysts initially forecast.One problem for now, according to crypto analysts, is that investors can’t take immediately their ether out – so they’re stuck in the protocol even as the staking yields keep declining. The withdrawal option won’t really become available until Ethereum’s next significant upgrade, ""Shanghai,” expected to occur in 2023.“You can only put stake in but can’t take stake out,” said Nick Hotz, vice president of research at the digital-asset management firm Arca Funds.So unlike in traditional bond markets, where yields can rise or fall based on supply and demand, the Ethereum staking yield isn’t “responsive.”“In the future, that will be responsive, and it looks a lot more like a bond market, where there are more interest generated if there's more going on in the economy,” Hotz said.According to data from Dune Analytics, more than 14 million ether, worth over $2 billion, are currently being staked on the Ethereum blockchain, including a spike in deposits during the third quarter, when the shift to the proof-of-stake model took effect, known as the Merge. That amount of ether staked is up 7.5% from the end of the second quarter.The Merge was intended to make the Ethereum blockchain more energy efficient than its former “proof-of-work” model – also the same system that the Bitcoin blockchain uses.Under the proof-of-stake system, the blockchain’s security – making sure transactions go through as intended and that the cryptocurrency is safe – is provided by “validators” who stake their ether as a sort of guarantee. Becoming a validator or staker requires at least 32 ETH (about $50,600 worth) to be locked up on the blockchain.But as more stakers rush in and more ETH is deposited, the yield gets spread out more thinly.Hotz said that Ethereum’s staking yield is typically determined by four variables: gross ETH issuance, transaction fees generated per day by Ethereum, burning rate and the amount of ETH being staked.There’s a formula, in fact. The annualized staking yield is: [annual gross ETH issuance + annual fees * (1-% of fees burned)]/average ETH staked over the year.In other words: The amount of ether staked is in the denominator of the fraction. So as the number gets bigger, the yield shrinks.At the current level, the Ethereum staking yield is roughly on par with that of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield, which topped 4.2% this year, the highest level since 2008.The takeaway is that stakers are apparently content to collect roughly the same yield by sticking their money into the Ethereum blockchain as by investing in triple-A-rated U.S. government bonds, considered among the world’s safest investments.The staking growth is “a sign that traders find it a reliable alternative to the traditional markets,” Alan Goldberg, market analyst at BestBrokers, said in a note.“Making a deposit for a year without access to your funds is a risky move, especially if the funds are in crypto,"" said Goldberg. “However, traders continue to stake ... It just proves that many traders feel secure with Ethereum.”",2022/10/31

595,"Sometime in the (Eastern time zone) evening on July 25, 2021, was the start of a magical run for bitcoin, punctuated by a late night 5% jump (noted by the yellow arrow in chart below). Bitcoin was in the mid-$30,000s range at the time, but by November it had reached an all-time high of around $68,000.That era (basically ancient history at this point) zoomed back into my head last week. Bitcoin started 1 p.m. Eastern time on October 25 at $19,808.06, got as high as $20,176 during the hour, and was at $20,126.20 at 2 p.m. ET. The low in that hour was also $19,808.06 – an only-go-up hour.You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.Granted, this move wasn’t as big as the July 2021 one, but it raised eyebrows nonetheless (astute readers will see another such candle on the morning of October 26). I’m also not implying that past performance is indicative of future results, so characterizing this one hour of price movement as the start of another run up to all-time highs would be premature (though history tends to rhyme).But let’s face it, the bitcoin market has been pretty boring and last week was anything but. Not just because of the move up, but also because it happened in spite of last week’s dismal performance of big technology stocks.Let’s first start with bitcoin’s good week.Bitcoin’s price could be up for any number of reasons, but here are two key things that happened on Wednesday. The Bank of Canada surprised financial markets by raising interest rates by only 50 basis points instead of 75 basis points. And the U.S. Census Bureau also reported a 10.9% decline in new home sales in September around the same time.Both feed into the same idea: Central banks might slow rate increases because the economy is cooling enough to tame inflation. Policy makers in Canada raised by less than expected. Meanwhile, U.S. inflation has been fueled, in part, by a hot housing market. Maybe that drop in home sales will start moving the U.S. Federal Reserve toward slowing its own rate increases? We’ll find out what the Fed has in mind during next week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting.While bitcoin and crypto soared, most of Big Tech had a bad week. Last week, Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MFST) reported quarterly earnings. Each of these companies, except Apple, straight up had a bad time.Between October 24 and October 28: GOOGL shed 6.2%, Amazon dropped 13.3%, Apple gained 4.5%, Meta crashed 23.5%, and Microsoft lost 4.8%.Meanwhile, bitcoin gained 6.8%.I’ve written about bitcoin and the stock market decoupling before. So if you, like me, believe bitcoin has potential as a new macro asset with some level of uncorrelatedness to traditional macro assets, it is nice to see bitcoin breaking its widely written-about correlation to tech stocks for at least one week. Of course, one week doesn’t mean that the correlation is gone, but it does put a dent in both the statistical reality and the narrative.Here are my two takeaways from this past week:First, the stocks that performed poorly were suffering from a bad earnings week. Meta decimated its free cash flow chasing the metaverse, Alphabet’s Google online advertising revenue was weak, Microsoft is down even though it beat top-line revenue and earnings expectations because cloud revenue missed and guidance was weak, and Amazon came up short last quarter and also shared that the holiday season wouldn’t be as busy as expected.Bitcoin and (most of) crypto don’t have earnings announcements, which is playing to its favor here. Noelle Acheson, who writes the Crypto Is Macro Now blog (and used to write this newsletter), put it well:""An important feature of BTC and [ether] is that neither are ‘burdened’ with the risk of disappointing holders with lower-than-expected earnings per token.""Exactly. Maybe there is something to be said for more frequent earnings reporting from public companies in the name of smoothing out aggressive price movements. Pump out earnings data every 10 minutes? (It’s actually a terrible idea, in my opinion, but there are some who want more real-time info.)Second, it is interesting to see stocks, particularly Meta and Amazon, trade like the cryptocurrencies that Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler is hyperfocused on protecting consumers from. You know, the ones that go to zero in a blink of an eye? Interesting is not really the right word. It’s concerning.What is interesting about these stocks falling apart is that bitcoin looks stable by comparison. That’s also true if you zoom out a little more and look at the past month: Meta is down 23.5%, Amazon is down 13.3% yet bitcoin is up 6.8%.That sentence was insane to write, so here it is again differently: Bitcoin looks stable in comparison with corporate superstars Meta and Amazon.",2022/10/30

The implication is that through all the turmoil, and incorporating asset volume, investors who went long BTC from June 13 forward are, on average, moving closer to break-even status.AVWAP levels can often serve as levels of support and/or resistance, so prices surpassing this mark could be significant.Using AVWAP for ETH, and anchoring from June 13, shows the price surpassed AVWAP levels on Oct. 25.

Most recent was Barclays, which cut the stock to equalweight from overweight, and its price target by 92% to 25 cents from $3.“We are moving to the sidelines as we await further clarification on strategic alternatives and potential capital structure changes,” Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal wrote in a research note to clients. Another Wall Street investment bank, BTIG, lowered the stock's rating to neutral from buy on Thursday, echoing similar sentiment.Core Scientific's woes reflect the depressed state of the bitcoin mining industry, with firms squeezed between high electricity costs and a muted bitcoin price.
