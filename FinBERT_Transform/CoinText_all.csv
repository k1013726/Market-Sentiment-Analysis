0,2023-02-28,"The volatility of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) has been declining in recent days, despite an increasingly uncertain regulatory and interest rate environment.Since Feb. 24, the average true range (ATR) for BTC and ETH has fallen 16% and 11%, respectively. ATR is a measure of market volatility.By comparison, the ATR for traditional financial indices (S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, Dow Jones Industrial Average) declined 2.7%, 2.1% and 1.5%, respectively, over the same period.The reduced volatility follows last week’s unexpectedly hot inflation data, which offered compelling evidence the U.S. Federal Reserve will need to continue its current hawkish pace of interest rate hikes for an extended time.To be sure, markets still anticipate the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee will raise rates by 25 basis points (bps) during its March 22 meeting, although the probability of a 50 bps increase has ticked up slightly. Still, inflationary fears are arguably more concerning than regulatory ones. India, which is currently president of the G-20 group of nations, appears to be pushing for a coordinated global effort to regulate cryptocurrencies. The United States supports the initiative.A synthesis paper to be published in September by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will provide more detail about a regulatory framework.Crypto markets have not responded to either with a spike in volatility. Rather, BTC and ETH’s Bollinger Bands suggest the opposite. Bollinger Bands follow an asset’s 20-day moving average, simultaneously plotting prices two standard deviations above and below the average. They reflect increased or decreased volatility.It's been 43 days since bitcoin or ether prices have breached the upper range of their respective Bollinger Bands. The range of BTC’s Bollinger Bands currently spans from approximately $21,000 to 25,600. For ETH, the current range runs from $1,490 to $1,750.Current prices for both are at their 20-day moving averages, further highlighting the recent contraction in volatility."
1,2023-02-28,"The direction the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies takes likely depends on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve takes a more hawkish approach to raising interest rates as it battles inflation, Imran Lakha, the founder of Options Insights, said Tuesday.Earlier this month, bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reached its highest level since August. But bitcoin declined after Friday's personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index data from the U.S. Commerce Department climbed by an unexpectedly robust 5.4% in January. Economists had predicted a 5% increase.Bitcoin and other cryptos fell after the report was released. In addition, according to the CME's FedWatch tool, the odds of the U.S. Federal Reserve hiking its benchmark fed funds rate by 50 basis points in March have risen thanks to the PCE index data. That adds to the volatility.Lakha said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” that volatility declined substantially between November and December in the aftermath of the collapse of major crypto companies including exchange FTX.It wasn’t until downside volatility subsided that risk appetite came back to the market, he said. That, in turn, led to more purchases of bullish bets (calls) relative to bearish bets (puts) in the options markets. Call options are financial contracts that give the option buyer the right but not the obligation to buy, while puts give the right but not the obligation to sell.“As we started to see the market could come alive again, and we started to see those big moves of 10%-plus to the upside, all those skews flipped around back towards calls, particularly on bitcoin,” Lakha said.Now, he said interest in puts has more or less “evaporated after the market made that big bottom last year.”BTC is currently trading at just above $23,500, but Lakha did not rule out the possibility it “could trade all the way back down to $16,000” before bouncing back to $28,000 or even $30,000. The implied levels of volatility could be cheap enough to make buying puts attractive again, he said.More broadly, the crypto options market by and large relies on bitcoin staying above the $20,000 to $21,000 threshold to support projects within the industry, Lakha noted.Retail investors who still own crypto are likely in it for the long haul, he said.“They’re not really buying it from a tactical perspective. They’re in it, but they’ve seen the bad times,” Lakha said. “They’re going to probably hold on to it.”See also: Bitcoin at Risk of Deeper Pullback Toward $20K: Chart Analysts"
2,2023-02-28,"As political experts focus on the diplomatic dance amid building tensions between the United States and China (punctuated by some balloon-shaped comic relief that might end up being not so funny after all), a more benign battle is brewing in the halls of financial regulators. While local for now, nothing stays local for long in global markets. The potential ramifications go well beyond crypto markets, potentially shaping economic influence that, in this changing landscape, is more geostrategically important than ever.Earlier this week, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) published the proposed text of its upcoming crypto regulation, slated to go into effect on June 1, and opened it up for public comment. Its scope includes the licensing of crypto-asset service platforms, which were originally only going to be allowed to service accredited investors. The SFC is now seeking input on whether or not retail investors should also be allowed to participate, and what types of protections should be in place. Also open for discussion is the range of “approved” assets, which in principle would only include a limited selection of the most liquid tokens.So far, this seems like yet another example of a jurisdiction way ahead of the United States in terms of regulatory clarity and willingness to engage with the public on the topic. Yet, lifting the lid a little, it is so much more. It is also an example of the East-West strategy divide, the power of retail and the importance of watching the flows.Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.Not that long ago, Hong Kong was not exactly welcoming to crypto businesses, but nor was it overtly antagonistic. It seemed to regard them as largely inconsequential, in contrast to China’s building antagonism. In 2020, Hong Kong announced plans to introduce a new licensing regime to directly regulate all crypto platforms and to limit their reach to accredited investors. This recent move seems not only to clarify those promises but also to broaden the scope and take into account what the regulators see as growing retail interest.Yet, it's about more than licensing. Hong Kong has also budgeted HK$50 million (~$6.4 million) for crypto asset development, including education efforts for individuals and businesses. And Hong Kong's financial secretary, Paul Chan, announced the launch of a task force composed of policy and industry representatives to explore crypto asset integration. This feels much broader and longer-term than just crypto service provider oversight.In part, it’s about laying some groundwork for the economic growth of the region. Hong Kong’s economy depends largely on financial services and tourism from the mainland, both of which were hit hard by the strict COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. It recently reported its fourth consecutive quarterly GDP contraction, and the region’s Chief Executive John Lee has vowed to prioritize attracting foreign talent. Most crypto firms based in Hong Kong left as China’s 2021 crypto trading and mining ban cast a cloud of operational uncertainty. Now, several have announced they will be applying to return.It's also about more than just Hong Kong and its 7 million residents. Hong Kong is obviously closely affiliated with China. The two jurisdictions operate under the constitutional principle of “one country, two systems,” which separates Hong Kong’s economic administration from that of its much larger parent. But events leading up to and during the recent protests made clear to the world that China holds the reins, and that nothing happens in Hong Kong without China’s approval.Here’s where it gets particularly interesting: China seems to approve of Hong Kong’s crypto moves.Earlier last week, Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials had been seen at Hong Kong crypto events. They were not undercover. In January, Huang Yiping, a former member of the monetary policy committee of China’s central bank, said in a public speech the country should reconsider its crypto ban. He was not speaking on behalf of the central bank, but it is extremely unlikely his speech would have become public without official approval.None of this necessarily means that mainland China will be opening up to crypto markets any time soon – but it could be that China is watching Hong Kong’s moves with a view to relaxing its stance and eventually supporting the integration of global crypto assets into its economy.This matters, in part, because of size. There are no small numbers in China, and the sheer scale of the potential participant pool could dwarf virtually any market. The country reportedly has 212 million retail investors – for comparison, the entire population of the United States is approximately 330 million. Many of these investors have withdrawn from the stock market given the economic uncertainty during the dark lockdown period, but with the improving outlook some of the buildup of pandemic savings could be looking for high returns.What’s more, Chinese retail investors tend to be less risk-averse than their U.S. counterparts. In general, they prefer momentum chasing to steady yields, which, in part, explains their enthusiasm for crypto markets a few years ago and why the potential risk of a wipeout grew to the stage where the government felt the need to close off access. It did not manage to completely stamp out crypto activity, however – 8% of FTX’s creditors are mainland-based, according to the filings, and China-based miners could account for approximately 20% of global hashrate, according to the most recent study of bitcoin mining published by Cambridge.Also, China is one of the few regions of the world actively easing money supply. Earlier this month, the central bank ramped up liquidity injections while keeping the monetary policy rate steady, but analysts expect the committee to continue to cut rates in the second quarter. The number of new loans extended by Chinese banks more than tripled between December and January. Most of us don’t have to cast our memories too far back to remember what monetary easing can do for risk assets.It also matters, in part, because of geopolitics. It is no secret that China would like to see a weakening of the dollar’s international role without actually hurting the dollar, and it seems to understand that the role of U.S. capital markets is a key factor in global trade. For a few years now financial regulators have been working to encourage more activity on Chinese markets, such as opening them more to foreign investors, enabling more hedging, streamlining onshore listing requirements and boosting trade settled in yuan.Allowing the opening of crypto markets could, of course, encourage more flows out of the yuan, which the Chinese authorities would understandably prefer to avoid. But if crypto assets and the innovation they bring are going to be key to the development of the financial markets of tomorrow, then China would obviously want some influence. Furthermore, China is probably watching with interest the building antagonism toward crypto from Washington, D.C. If the U.S. sees crypto markets as a threat, it could be a threat worth exploring.This is representative of the typical strategic approaches of the two economic superpowers. I once heard someone compare the relative philosophies to board games popular in each region. In the U.S. they play chess, where you win by killing your opponent’s leader. In China they prefer Go, where you win by conquering and holding onto territory. It could be that Chinese leaders see crypto assets as a territory play, with global financial markets as the playing field. Rather than an enemy to be weakened, crypto markets could be a strategic pillar of a new world order, or at the very least an opportunity to attract global capital, talent and prestige.So far this year, analysts have been focusing on macro factors as the main driver of crypto market performance, with evolving use cases and technical speculation also a feature of the recovery. It could be that a more significant driver is slowly building on the global strategy stage – specifically, in the geopolitical rivers of the east."
3,2023-02-28,"Bitcoin's (BTC) recent technical failure at key price resistance has raised the risk of a deeper pullback, according to analysts studying price charts.The leading cryptocurrency's upswing has recently stalled, with prices failing to crack resistance at $25,200, which capped the August bounce.""Bitcoin has been unable to break out above trading range resistance near $25.2K, resulting in a whipsaw lower for the daily MACD,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, said in a note to clients on Monday, using the acronym for ""moving average divergence/convergence,"" an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend changes. ""Given the MACD 'sell' signal, and with room to oversold levels per the daily stochastics, we shift to a bearish short-term bias.""Stockton expects bitcoin to revisit $20,000 after brief stabilization at around the 50-day simple moving average, currently at $22,567. At press time, bitcoin was changing hands near $23,500.The MACD histogram has recently dropped below zero, indicating a bearish shift in momentum. Aficionados of technical analysis consider MACD's bearish shift to be a sell signal.Meanwhile, the stochastic indicator, used to gauge overbought and oversold conditions, is yet to fall below 30, implying room for price declines. A reading below 30 indicates an asset is oversold and usually marks an end to price drops.According to Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, bitcoin's weekly chart also favors a deeper pullback.""Technically, bitcoin is selling off after touching its 200-week moving average. And due to the negative momentum at the end of the week, it has also fallen below the 50-week moving average. This dynamic may be a prologue to further declines, a predictable tug-of-war near trend levels,"" Kuptsikevich said in an email on Monday.Bitcoin has turned lower from its 200-week simple moving average (SMA) after facing rejection above the same for two consecutive weeks.The 50-week SMA has dropped below the 200-week SMA, producing what is known as the ""death cross,"" a bearish development.The expected price decline, however, would be a temporary bull breather, according to Kuptsikevich.""A pullback in bitcoin to $21.5K would remain a correction within a bull market, but a sharp drop below that level could force a reassessment of whether we are out of a bear market,"" Kuptsikevich said."
4,2023-02-28,"Liquidity conditions in the bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) markets continue to worsen, and the situation is now more alarming than it was three months ago. That has traders worried about abrupt price swings in the crypto market.Liquidity refers to the ability of the market to absorb large buy and sell orders at stable prices. The commonly used metric for assessing liquidity conditions is 2% of market depth – a collection of buy and sell offers within 2% of the mid-price or the average of the bid and the ask/offer prices.More significant the depth, the more liquid an asset is said to be, and vice versa.Data from Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko show bitcoin's 2% market depth for USDT pairs aggregated from 15 centralized exchanges has slipped to 6,800 BTC, the lowest since May 2022 when the Terra network collapsed and below the level that followed the demise of crypto exchange FTX. It's down significantly from the October highs of above 15,000 BTC. Ether's 2% market depth has more than halved to 57,000 ETH since October, led by Binance.""Thin liquidity means more drastic moves, particularly in alternative cryptocurrencies,"" Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at Astronaut Capital, said.""Funds trying to trade size are forced to TWAP over longer periods (days or weeks) hence why it looks like some charts have recently been 'walked up' such as STX,"" Dibb added.TWAP, or time-weighted average price, is an algorithmic strategy focused on achieving an average trade execution price close to the time-weighted average price of the asset. In other words, it involves breaking a large order into smaller quantities and executing those at regular intervals to minimize the impact on the going market and reduce slippage.Slippage is the difference between the expected price at which a trade is placed and the actual price at which the buy/sell transaction is executed. Slippage usually occurs when there is low market liquidity or high volatility.""Realistically, though, dwindling market depth has also meant that most large funds have not been participating at the same level as previous due to the amount of slippage associated,"" Dibb noted, adding that any large institution that offloads coins now is going to have a deeper effect on the market.The latest decline in the market depth comes amid dwindling volatility expectations in the bitcoin market. This kind of situation often leads to sudden explosion in volatility, according to Griffin Ardern, a trader from crypto asset-management firm Blofin.The Bitcoin Volatility Index (BVIN), which measures the implied or expected volatility over the next 30 days, has declined to 56.39, its lowest level since at least early 2021, according to data source CryptoCompare.Bitcoin's seven-day variance risk premium, or the difference between the seven-day implied volatility and seven-day realized volatility, has flipped negative, according to data tracked by Amberdata. It shows short-term volatility expectations are underpriced.""An environment conducive to high volatility is being created,"" Ardern said. ""And because the depth is low, it only takes a small amount [buy/sell order] to influence the price, and the resulting hedging activity of market makers to amplify market volatility through hedging.""Market makers always take the opposite side of investors' trades and maintain a market-neutral portfolio by buying and selling the underlying asset as the price swings. Their hedging activity is known to influence the bitcoin's spot market price and could have an outsized impact this time, thanks to low market depth.The crypto market liquidity began drying up in mid-November after Alameda Research and FTX went bust. Alameda was one of the most prominent market makers, providing billions of dollars in liquidity to small- and large-cap tokens. The resulting contagion brought down several trading desks, including Arbitrage and high-frequency trading firms, and hurt prominent market makers like Genesis, which is owned by CoinDesk's parent company, Digital Currency Group.""It's likely all the major market makers were affected, to varying degrees, by the collapse of FTX. As a result, several liquidity providers have likely scaled back or even ceased their market-making activities as part of an overall effort to de-risk,"" Dick Lo, founder and CEO of TDX Strategies, said.""There's also been a migration of positions to decentralized exchanges to minimize counterparty risk, hence the growth in volumes at popular decentralized trading venues such as GMX,"" Lo added."
5,2023-02-28,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin stays rooted near the $23.5K threshold. Ether and many other major cryptos trade flat.Insights: China-based developers can interact with layer 1 blockchain Conflux, but the protocol's relationship with the country remains complicated.Bitcoin Holds Firm Near $23.5KBitcoin continued its weekend encampment near $23,500 into Monday as investors spent yet another day weighing fiendishly stubborn inflation and the prospects of the U.S. Federal Reserve hiking interest rates more hawkishly than was previously expected.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $23,481, roughly flat over the past 24 hours, but down from its highs a week ago over $25,000 – before surprisingly strong jobs and price data had markets increasingly contemplating the prospect of a 50 basis point rate increase instead of 25 bps.“Markets of late have been pricing in rates that will remain higher for longer than previously anticipated because of inflation numbers that seem to be rather stubborn,"" Brent Xu, CEO and co-founder of Web 3 bond-market platform Umee, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""A possible 50-basis-point hike could be in the offing now, too.""Yet Xu also noted hopefully that crypto markets have not seen ""a massive drawdown ... that the more alarmist crypto Twitter commentators have been warning about.""""I suspect that we haven’t seen a massive pullback because the forced sellers have already sold,"" he wrote, adding: ""Last year’s daisy chain of blowups appears to have mostly come to an end. This isn’t to say that we can’t go lower from here. But a bottom for this cycle is probably in now, and in turn we are probably in an accumulation phase. I think we need to be prepared for sideways action for some time.”Ether was almost equally flat, changing hands at about $1,630. Most other major cryptocurrencies were flat or edged down slightly with layer 2 platform Polygon's MATIC token and decentralized finance protocol Aave's AAVE token both recently down about 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets overall performance ticked down about 0.36%.After a week to forget, equity markets returned to their winning ways, however slightly. The tech-focused Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all ticked up a few fractions of a percentage point. Treasury yields dipped slightly but remained fretfully high at above $3.90 on a 10-year note.To be sure, some crypto news Monday was ominous for markets, none more than a report by crypto asset manager CoinShares that short-bitcoin funds had $10 million in inflows during the week ended Feb. 24 and that long-bitcoin funds bled $12 million, the third straight weekly outflow. Later in the day, crypto exchange Coinbase tweeted that it would suspend trading of Binance USD (BUSD) starting March 13 because the stablecoin doesn’t meet its listing standards – the latest body blow to the stablecoin sector.Yet, at least one other analyst was feeling at least partly upbeat about crypto prices' path forward. In an interview with CoinDesk TV, Bruno Ramos de Sousa, head of new markets at crypto asset manager Hashdex, said that markets were ""in the recovery phase already ... past the bottom."" Ramos de Sousa noted increased interest among institutional investors in recent months.""They're educated in the sector, and they're looking for interesting windows to come in,"" he said. ""These are hedge funds, family offices, people concerned with bottoms and ups.""Layer 1 Blockchain Conflux Has a Complicated Relationship With ChinaBeijing is pro-blockchain, but anti-crypto. It sees the former as a key technology, as important in the 21st century as the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP) was in the 20th; the latter is a speculative asset that inhibits the worst parts of capitalism.Meanwhile, ""China"" tokens are surging. ""China"" is in quotes because most of these projects like NEO, VeChain (VET), and Conflux (CFX) go to great lengths to limit their exposure to China. They have development teams in China, but the company is registered offshore.You can use the technology within the country, just not trade the token. A version of NEO is available on China’s Blockchain Service Network, for instance, but this exists as a seperate universe from the NEO the rest of the world sees in order to comply with local law.In many cases, these tokens are divorced from the project. You can’t see China data on-chain, and it might be questionable as to what is driving the token’s growth.Conflux’s CFX token is the exception to this.Can you trade Conflux’s CFX token in China? No.Can someone within China interact with the Western-facing portion of the Conflux chain? Also no, these parts are segregated.But at the same time, CFX is the tie that binds the two together.""There is only one chain, but we have two spaces,"" Fan Long, Conflux’s co-founder, told CoinDesk by email. ""You can think of the spaces acting like independent chains but they share the same consensus engine. There is no security risk of moving assets across two spaces.""Within China, CFX relies on Conflux’s sponsorship mechanism, which allows ordinary users to interact with smart contracts without holding crypto. Stuff still exists on-chain minus the gas fees.Developers of decentralized applications, such as China’s version of Instagram called “Little Red Book,” buy CFX from Conflux directly. They pay in fiat and get an official receipt. In many ways, it would be similar to paying for a cloud service hosting bill.“Because the public chain must have a native token governing its resources for gas, and China does not encourage anything related to fungible tokens, we choose to have foreign entities to govern the token issuance of CFX,” Long said.One can see on-chain how CFX is used. Below shows the on-chain activity for a digital collectible, China’s version of a non-fungible token (which it calls “digital collectibles,” and tolerates if speculation is not involved) on its version of Instagram.In many ways, CFX could be thought of as a proxy of success for Conflux within China.

6,2023-02-27,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) momentum this year has yet to ignite larger-scale investment in other crypto assets such as stablecoins.Despite BTC’s 43% rise in 2023 and the 38% gain of ether (ETH), a significant amount of capital remains inactive, major stablecoin indicators suggest.Most notably, the stablecoin supply, which serves as a key mechanism by which many crypto assets are purchased, has been declining. When the stablecoin supply increases, it implies there is more capital to purchase crypto assets. When the supply of stablecoins falls, it implies the opposite.The aggregate supply net position change of the top four stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD and DAI) has been negative since Sept. 14, and has been trending lower since Feb 7.For historical context, the aggregate supply net position change for stablecoins was positive between February and March in 2022, reflecting strong demand for digital assets during that time period.Meanwhile, the stablecoin supply ratio (SSR), another key stablecoin indicator that measures the ratio of bitcoin’s market cap to the market cap of stablecoins, has been increasing, indicating that the buying power of stablecoins has decreased relative to BTC.The current SSR may indicate an underlying decrease in demand for BTC exists. But a more optimistic interpretation is that capital is sitting on the sidelines to be deployed in some capacity in the near future. While BTC has traded in negative territory in five of the most recent seven days, volume was relatively in line with its 20-day average.In some cases, BTC trading volume fell below its 20-day average. The same holds true for ETH, which has traded lower recently, but on average to below-average volume. At the moment, BTC and ETH appear to be establishing new levels of support near $23,000 and $1,640, respectively.The longer that BTC and ETH trade near these ranges, the more confidence investors are likely to have in those levels. The supply of stablecoins may be an important signal to watch and not just an indication of negative sentiment. A shift from where supply currently stands to where it stood between 2020-2022 could indicate a move higher."
7,2023-02-27,"Bitcoin layer 2 Stack Network's STX token on Monday rose to a fresh nine-month high of 97 cents, bringing its month-to-date gain to 220%. The Ordinals-driven rally, however, failed to impress derivatives traders.Data from Coinglass shows the funding rates in the perpetual futures market tied to STX remained negative even as open interest, or the dollar value locked in the number of active perpetual futures contracts, doubled to $80 million.In other words, new money entering the perpetual futures market amid the continued price rally is betting on a reversal. The negative funding rate – the cost of holding bullish long/bearish short positions in perpetuals – implies that leverage is skewed on the bearish side.""It could be a case of traders fading the hype of STX and shorting, largely due to the return of deeply negative after every price rally in the last week,"" Conor Ryder, research analyst at Paris-based Kaiko, told CoinDesk. ""I suspect traders are betting that there isn't a follow-up to Bitcoin NFTs and this is more of a flash in the pan.""Stacks Network, focused on unleashing Bitcoin's potential as a programmable blockchain, has been the beneficiary of the non-fungible token (NFT) on Bitcoin fever kicked off by the launch of the Ordinals protocol on Jan. 21. Ordinals are NFT-like art references inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of bitcoin (BTC).Per Ryder, the negative funding rates could also be due to STX being a relatively illiquid token.""As funding rates are the difference between spot and futures, when spot prices surge disproportionately more than derivatives, often due to illiquidity, this can cause funding to move deeply negative,"" Ryder said.Another possibility is that some traders, who bought STX in the spot market early this month, sold perpetual futures to lock in profits on the long spot position and bypass potential price volatility over the coming days."

BTC fell below $23,000 on Saturday, its lowest point since Feb. 15. Short-bitcoin funds, which profit from a decline in the price of BTC, saw inflows last week while the price of bitcoin fell over 3% after it failed to consolidate above $25,000. ""We believe this reaction reflects nervousness amongst U.S. investors prompted by the recent stronger-than-expected macro data releases, but also highlights its sensitivity to the regulatory crackdown in the U.S.,"" CoinShares said in a weekly report.Liquid staking is the new second-largest crypto sector, overtaking decentralized lending and borrowing. Liquid staking is now a $14.1 billion sector based on the total value of assets that have been locked on blockchain networks by users in return for rewards. Decentralized lending and borrowing protocols have $13.7 billion locked, while decentralized exchanges remain the largest sector with $19.4 billion. The upcoming Shanghai software upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain is seen as the catalyst for the rise of liquid staking because it will enable stakers to withdraw the ether they have staked and accumulated rewards on for the first time.Texas regulators have said the benefits to creditors from Binance.US’ proposed acquisition of bankrupt lender Voyager Digital may be negligible. A court filing Friday said the benefits hinge on whether Alameda Research is successful in recovering $446 million transferred to Voyager prior to its own bankruptcy. The court document also detailed concerns over Binance’s staking program, which it said appears to constitute an illegal securities offering. Alameda Research is a trading firm affiliated with collapsed crypto exchange FTX. It was also owned by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.- Omkar Godbole"
9,2023-02-27,"Prominent crypto investment funds are turning to tokens of the Stacks Network as they bet on the growth of Bitcoin. Stacks is a so-called layer 2 companion chain for smart contracts focused on bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, allowing for the creation of related financial products.Stack’s STX tokens have jumped 23% in the past 24 hours, adding to a 50% surge over a seven-day rolling period, CoinGecko data shows. Demand for the tokens has increased since the arrival of the Ordinals protocol, which went live on Jan. 21 and allows users to inscribe references to digital art into small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. The token's market cap topped $1.2 billion as of Monday.A recently published investment thesis by North Rock Digital highlighted Stacks' focus on decentralized finance (DeFi), the innovative use of smart contracts and its compatibility with Bitcoin as attributes that set it apart from other blockchain projects.“We believe there is a massive and relatively untapped market opportunity, a huge cultural inflection point in the community (sparked by ordinals) and transformative Stacks upgrade coming later this year,” North Rock Digital founder Hal Press said in a tweet over the weekend.The firm noted that Stacks has a strong community, experienced leadership and a clear road map for growth, and concluded that investing in Stacks could yield big returns as the project develops and gains adoption.Since its launch, Ordinals has caused a spike in bitcoin transactions and a resurgence in Bitcoin network development. It has also reignited discussions of Bitcoin scaling – a controversial topic in crypto circles.So far, more than 197,000 unique inscriptions, a term for each individual token on Ordinals, have been conducted, Dune Analytics data shows.North Rock didn't disclose specifics of its STX investment. Press didn't immediately respond to requests for comments.In its thesis, North Rock said Stacks offers several advantages over blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, including lower fees, faster transaction times and enhanced security.The analysis also explores potential use cases for Stacks technology, including the creation of decentralized social-media platforms, prediction and trading markets and lending and borrowing applications. Such products are the bedrock for $50 billion in locked token value on applications built on other blockchains, data from DefiLlama shows.A Stacks upgrade scheduled for March 20 may have also contributed to the recent price growth of STX. Developers introduced the Stacks 2.1 upgrade in a post last week that details several new features and improvements to the protocol.One of the main features is the introduction of ""Stacking 2.0,"" an updated version of the Stacks consensus mechanism. Stacking is a process in which STX token holders can lock up their tokens to help secure the network and earn rewards.Stacking 2.0 aims to make the process more accessible and inclusive by allowing smaller token holders to participate and earn rewards. The upgrade will also add improvements to smart contract functionality, enhanced scalability through the use of a new ""microblocks"" feature and better support for non-fungible tokens (NFTs)."
10,2023-02-27,Investors poured money into short bitcoin funds last week as upbeat U.S. economic data and the prospect of renewed outsized rate increases by the Federal Reserve weakened the appetite for risky assets.
11,2023-02-27,"Liquid staking, which allows users to earn rewards for locking cryptocurrency in a blockchain network while retaining the liquidity of the locked funds, is now bigger than decentralized lending and borrowing.The total value of crypto assets deposited in liquid staking protocols was $14.1 billion as of European trading hours on Monday, making it the second-largest crypto market sector, according to data source DefiLlama. The total value locked in decentralized-finance (DeFi) lending and borrowing protocols was $13.7 billion, the third largest, while decentralized exchanges, with deposits of $19.4 billion, held the top spot.The Ethereum blockchain's upcoming Shanghai software upgrade, which will allow stakers to withdraw the ether (ETH) they have staked and the accumulated rewards for the first time, has galvanized investor interest in liquid staking. Liquid staking is the best-performing crypto sector this year, with growth in total value locked approaching 60%.""It [the upgrade] will innovate the current space by allowing for healthy competition between liquid staking solutions, will strengthen ETH's position by providing yield from staking/unstaking, and will give users the security of maintaining sovereignty over their assets,"" Ryan Selkis, CEO of crypto research firm and data provider Messari, said in a newsletter published Friday.By opening up to withdrawals, the upgrade is expected to improve overall liquidity. Since December 2020, more than 16.5 million ETH has been staked in Ethereum's Beacon Chain, of which 42% has been locked through liquid staking protocols, mainly Lido.Users of liquid staking protocols like Lido receive derivative tokens such as staked ether (stETH) on a 1:1 basis. These derivative tokens represent a user's stake and can be used to generate additional yield across Defi protocols. Lido's governance token LDO has rallied 220% this year, outperforming industry leaders bitcoin (BTC) and ether by a huge margin. Governance tokens of Lido's rivals Rocket Pool and Frax have also surged, according to CoinDesk data.Liquid staking's increased popularity relative to decentralized lending could also be attributed to the yield differential between the two sectors.Lido, which controls over 75% of the liquid staking market, offers an annualized percentage return of 4.8% on staked ether, 6% on staked solana and 6.3% on Polygon's MATIC token. That's higher than the rates available for lending top stablecoins USDT, USDC and DAI on the DeFi giant Aave.Liquid staking is expected to grow further, because the ETH staking ratio, which measures the percentage of the cryptocurrency's supply staked, is significantly lower than other layer 1 cryptocurrencies.""Only 14% of ETH is currently being staked vs. 58%, the average for layer 1 coins, Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital-assets platform Matrixport, told CoinDesk. Its likely interest in staking will continue to swell.""Binance Research recently voiced a similar opinion, forecasting more inflow of money into staking protocols after the Shanghai upgrade.""It could be argued that many groups of individuals had been waiting for Shanghai to stake their ETH, as withdrawals will remove the liquidity risk and uncertainty of an previously undefined lock-up period,"" Binance Research said in a report early this month."
12,2023-02-27,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Solana is back and ticking upwards while bitcoin appears overbought.Insights: The SEC has overreached in its latest actions against crypto entities, but the crypto industry must improve its lobbying efforts to ensure future regulation is effective.Good morning, Asia, here’s how the crypto market is moving this Monday.Solana is up early 4% after the protocol crashed twice during the weekend, freezing transactions. The Solana Foundation says an investigation is underway into the cause of the crash and will be available shortly.Meanwhile, bitcoin is trading flat at $23,475. The world’s largest digital asset is up 1.5% in the last 24 hours. Ether is up 2.7% to $1,636.Katie Stockton, founder, and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, recently said on CoinDesk TV that bitcoin appears “overbought” making it difficult to clear $25,000.“The overbought condition would suggest that that resistance is left intact,” she said.Ether, Stockton says, is looking just like bitcoin. Both are part of a top-down-oriented market where macro forces are price action “as opposed to the fundamental value of things.”“[Ether] does look just like bitcoin, the range there as defined by resistance around $1,670,” she said.Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, adds that bitcoin is attempting to find support during a minor price correction.""If bitcoin remains in the current range, we are likely to see $25,000 and then $30,000. A rejection from here could see $20,000 first, followed by $18,000,"" he said in an email to CoinDesk.Looking toward next week, the U.S is scheduled to announce its consumer confidence index for February on Tuesday and jobless claims on Thursday. In Asia, the People’s Bank of China will be announcing its balance of trade figures on Tuesday and its inflation rate on Thursday.With the world’s two biggest economies set to announce important economic data over the next week, all eyes will be on crypto to see if it can overcome key resistance levels.Crypto Lobbying Needs a Reset: More FTC, Less SECCoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey writes the weekly ""Money Reimagined"" newsletter. This essay originally appeared on CoinDesk's website on Feb. 24.Is there a method to the SEC’s madness?Of all the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) actions against crypto entities that have stirred the industry’s ire, the agency’s recent move forcing New York-based Paxos to cease issuing its partner Binance’s BUSD stablecoin is the most deserving of an outcry. How, critics rightfully asked, can a token that’s explicitly designed not to fluctuate in price be considered a security?But a recent account in Fortune suggests the SEC may not have been thinking of securities law at all in that action. Binance was automatically converting competitor-issued stablecoins held by its exchange’s customers’ into BUSD. To me, that looks like an antitrust concern, not one of BUSD being a security.Now, if there’s one area of enforcement where the crypto community, with its anti-middleman ethos of decentralization, should get behind, it’s prosecution of monopolistic behavior. But that leaves us with the question of why is the SEC getting involved here and not the nation’s trustbuster, the Federal Trade Commission?I get two takeaways from this:Find the full article here:ETHDenver 2023Annual BEAR Research Conference: New Digital Technologies and the Future Financial Landscape1 p.m. HKT/SGT(5 a.m. UTC): Japan leading economic index (Dec.)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Coinbase Unveils Its Layer 2 Base; Chamber of Digital Commerce CEO on State of Crypto RegulationCrypto exchange Coinbase’s new layer 2 blockchain Base had a rough start on Thursday, drawing a stream of complaints from users on social media.

13,2023-02-24,"Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) have lost their momentum over the past seven days, with each posting 6% declines as investors worried about inflation and continued monetary hawkishness.On Friday the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization plunged after the U.S. Commerce Department reported that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index climbed by an unexpectedly robust 5.4% in January, offering the latest evidence that inflation remained problematic. The PCE price index is the U.S. Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge.BTC dipped near $23,000 at one point Friday, its lowest level in nine days. ETH was recently off about 2.5% over the past 24 hours.Weekly rankingsOn a relative basis, BTC’s seven-day performance was 22nd among crypto assets with a greater than $1 billion market capitalization. Ether finished 23rd among the group. Still, the two assets remain up 39% and 32% year to date amid a moderately, more upbeat economic environment than in 2022.Topping the list was tezos (XTZ), the token of the self-amending protocol that facilitates the creation of smart contracts. Tezos posted an 8% gain over the most recent seven days, and is up 74% year to date.At the bottom was fantom (FTM), the token of the Fantom smart contract platform, that posted a 17% loss.While falling below the $1 billion market cap threshold, the token (OP) of the Optimism network rose approximately 20% this week, following Coinbase Global’s (COIN) announcement of its new layer 2 network launch. The network will be built using Optimism, which will also serve as a core platform developer.Technically, momentum for both BTC and ETH declined this week because their Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings fell near the neutral level of 50. Bitcoin’s price has declined for four consecutive days on above-average volume. ETH’s price has fallen in five of the most recent seven days.BTC’s 50-day moving average remains above its 200-day moving average, a so-called golden cross that usually yields positive results but has yet to do so in this most recent instance. BTC’s price is down 6% since its occurrence on Feb. 18.The pricing relationship between BTC and ETH remains tight, as their correlation coefficient sits at 0.94.Bitcoin’s prior inverse correlation with the dollar index (DXY) has shifted this week to positive, with a correlation coefficient of 0.50.On a macroeconomic basis, little occurred this week to shake the probabilities of continued interest rate hikes by the U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). While inflation has moderated, the persistently tight labor market remains concerning for Federal Reserve governors.Week-to-date performance among the CoinDesk CMI sectors shows the Digitization sector up slightly to lead the rankings, with all other CMI sectors trading negatively. Members of the CoinDesk Digitization index include Braintrust (BTRST), Civic (CVC), Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and Galxe (GAL)."
14,2023-02-24,"The odds of the U.S. Federal Reserve hiking its benchmark fed funds rate by 50 basis points in March are on the rise after the PCE Price Index showed the disinflation trend reversed in January.The PCE Price Index for January rose 5.4% from a year ago, compared with a 5.3% increase in December. The January number was far stronger than economist forecasts of a 5.0% increase. The core rate, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 4.7% versus 4.6% in December and was higher than the estimated 4.3% growth.On a monthly basis, the PCE Price Index gained 0.6% in January, up from 0.2% in December and against expectations for a 0.5% increase. The core rate also rose 0.6% in January, versus a 0.4% increase in December and forecasts for a 0.4% rise.Risky assets fell following the report, with bitcoin (BTC) shedding about $200 to $23,730 and threatening to fall to $23,000, which would be its lowest level of this week. Nasdaq 100 futures were down 1.9%, and S&P 500 futures were lower by 1.4%.In addition, crypto-related stocks are off sharply. Coinbase (COIN), MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Marathon Digital (MARA) are all lower by 5%-8%.Though severely backward looking – this report is for January – the gauge of personal consumer expenditures remains the Fed's favored inflation indicator. Following the report, odds of a 50 basis point rate hike (as opposed to 25 basis points) at the Fed's next policy meeting in March are rising, with traders now nearly evenly split between the two choice, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. As recently as one month ago, there was roughly a 100% expectation of a 25 basis point move in March.Though remaining elevated, inflation during late 2022 had been trending lower, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell saying in January he was seeing signs of a disinflation trend. This report could call that into question.""Inflation remains stubborn and sticky between 4%-5%,"" tweeted RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas. ""Service inflation continues to increase with goods disinflation cooling. [The] risk of a March 50 basis point hike [is] rising and we are clearing moving toward a 5.5% policy peak at a minimum.""(UPDATE Feb. 24, 2023 16:40 UTC) Adds information about crypto-related stocks."
15,2023-02-24,"Yes, you read the headline right. Bitcoin (BTC) futures really are, unusually, trading at a higher premium on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange than on Binance.Three-month bitcoin futures listed on the CME, which is widely considered a proxy for institutional activity, are trading at an annualized premium of around 8.7% to the underlying reference index. The equivalent premium on offshore exchanges, mainly Binance, has jumped to 6.3%, the highest since January 2022.On the CME, the premium is at its highest positive basis level since November 2021, according to data tracked by Arcane Research. Back then, bitcoin traded at record highs near $69,000 – almost three times the current $24,850, CoinDesk data shows. (We are talking of premiums in standard futures market here, not perpetuals, which are futures-like derivatives with no expiry.)Bitcoin has surged over 45% so far this year, outperforming traditional risky assets, including Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq index, by a significant margin. Futures typically trade at a premium in a sign of leverage being skewed on the bullish side when the underlying asset is appreciating in value. Conversely, during bear markets, discounts are often observed.""The bull is back,"" Arcane Research analyst Vetle Lunde told CoinDesk.Historically, futures on the CME have traded at a relatively lower premium than those on Binance and other unregulated offshore entities, predominantly because these latter avenues offered higher leverage. That means traders on offshore exchanges were able to take bigger bullish bets while depositing a relatively small amount of money, called a margin.Offshore exchanges, however, have cut back on leverage since the second half of 2021, and they now account for just 30% of the global futures activity, while the rest comes from the CME.Another reason the CME has flipped offshore exchanges is that futures-based exchange-traded funds tied to bitcoin invest only in regulated CME futures contracts.According to Arcane Research, open interest, or the number of open futures contracts on the CME, sits at 80,586 BTC – or 70% of the global open interest. That's significantly higher than 28% during the height of the bull run in April 2021.""It is rare to see CME futures trade at a [higher] premium,"" Lunde said. ""With that in mind, CME is a huge part of BTC futures activity as a whole. The offshore futures market is insignificantly small now, with all activity concentrated in perpetuals.""Looking forward, a continued move higher in the premium may see carry traders return to the market. The cash-and-carry arbitrage involves buying bitcoin in the spot market and simultaneously selling futures contracts in a bid to pocket the premium. Carry trading was quite popular during the bull run when premiums reached as high as 40% on offshore exchanges."
16,2023-02-24,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin tossed and turned above and below $24K before settling over the threshold.Insights: Bitcoin funding rates have been positive for 10 consecutive days. Why should investors care?Bitcoin Shows Its Mettle in Rebounding Above $24KBitcoin spent Thursday in a fretfully, uncertain mood, teeter-tottering below and above $24,000 as investors continued to evaluate the U.S. Federal Reserve's ongoing dialogue about monetary policy and jobs data suggesting that inflation would remain problematic.The largest cryptocurrency was recently trading at $24,052, down 0.4% over the past 24 hours but well off its earlier week high over $25,000. Still, analysts remain cautiously optimistic about BTC's prospects after watching it surge about 40% since the start of the year amid an improved, overall economic backdrop.""People feel that the worst may be over in terms of bad news that we had in the crypto sector last year, and that's why it's [bitcoin] more resilient,"" Bradley Duke, co-CEO of institutional-grade digital asset-back securities provider ETC Group, told CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" program.In a separate CoinDesk TV interview, Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at research platform Stockcharts.com, said he was encouraged by bitcoin's ability to hold support first at $18,000 and than at higher levels in recent months, including its recent perch around $24,000. ""As long as we remain around that level, where we now are – we can put in a low here and break through 25K – that is a signal to go up to that 30K area,"" de Kempenaer said.Ether was recently changing hands at $1,659, up about 1.1%. Other major cryptos were flat, albeit tinted slightly red with AVAX, the token of base-layer network Avalanche Network, and MATIC, the token of layer 2 platform Polygon, dropping about 3% and 2.5%, respectively. OPT, the native crypto of layer 2 scaling tool Optimism, was up more than 6% hours after crypto exchange Coinbase said it was building its layer 2 blockchain using the OP Stack in collaboration with the protocol.The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a measure of the digital asset market's performance, was down 0.2%.Stocks rose with the S&P 500, which has a technology heavy component gaining 0.5% to break a four-day losing streak and the tech-focused Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rising a few fractions of a percentage point. The Nasdaq took heart from semi conductor manufacturer Nvidia, which on Wednesday said it expected business to improve amid the euphoria about the ChatGPT artificial intelligence chat tool. AI tokens have been surging since the public unveiling of chatbot ChatGPT and image generation software Dall-E in mid-2022.Meanwhile, the U.S. Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims for the week ending Feb. 18 fell by 3,000 to 192,000 but were below the consensus estimate of 200,000. Strong jobs data has been thorny for the U.S. Federal Reserve as it tries to reduce inflation from 6.4% to a target rate of 2%. The ongoing angst about high prices has made risk-on investors hesitant.On an eventful day, crypto news was mixed. As CoinDesk reported, venture capital powerhouses a16z led a $25 million Series A investment in Here Not There to build out Towns, a Web3 group chat protocol and app that lets online communities build blockchain-based gatherings in a fully decentralized way, and Pantera invested $10 million in Worldwide Webb, creator of a pixel art-based metaverse game. But Federal law enforcement authorities added to charges against Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced, former CEO of crypto exchange FTX, and NFT platform Dapper Labs said that it was laying off 20% of its employees less than four months after a 22% workforce cut.Stockcharts.com's De Kempenaer noted that the ""risk appetite of the investor is increasing again.""""Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general could benefit on the back of that,"" he said. ""And if you just look at what's happening in the crypto market, you see buyers coming in. They're willing to pay higher prices, sellers are holding on longer – they only want to sell at higher prices.""Bitcoin Funding Rates 10-Day Streak Reflects Investor BullishnessFunding rates for bitcoin were positive for the 10th consecutive day.Funding rates represent payments between holders of perpetual futures contracts. When the rate is positive, holders of long positions pay holders of short positions in order to remain on that side of the trade.When funding rates are negative, the opposite is the case, where shorts pay longs. In bitcoin’s case, funding rates have been positive every day since Jan. 14, with the exception of a neutral reading on Feb. 12. Investors holding long positions expect an asset’s value to increase, while those who are short an asset expect its value to decline.Persistently positive funding rates indicate that BTC traders currently view the asset favorably, and are willing to pay a fee to express their bullishness.12:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(4:30 UTC) United States Core Personal Consumption Expenditures - Price Index (YoY/Jan)12:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(4:30 UTC) United States Personal Income (MoM/Jan)2:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(6:00 UTC) Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (Feb)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Kraken Exec on SEC Crackdown, Future of Staking; SEC Objects to Binance.US’ $1B Voyager DealKraken head of OTC options trading Juthica Chou discussed the exchange's settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

17,2023-02-23,"Crypto markets were trading mostly sideways, with some major tokens up a little but others falling slightly after the latest jobs data showed labor markets remaining stubbornly tight.Initial jobless claims for the week ending Feb. 18 fell by 3,000 to 192,000 but arrived below the consensus estimate of 200,000. Strong jobs data has been thorny for the U.S. Federal Reserve in its efforts to reduce inflation rates from 6.4% to its target rate of 2%.Strong jobs data, which is generally an economic boom, has counterintuitively weighed against asset prices because a strong employment environment leads to higher prices as organizations ratchet up wages to recruit and retain scarce talent.Yet, bitcoin and ether shrugged off the latest reading to trade 0.50% and 0.40% higher, respectively, during the 13:00 UTC (8 a.m. ET) hour of release. Selling pressure increased throughout the remainder of the day on average volume, although both BTC and ETH recently remained in the green.Other relevant economic data on Thursday showed that U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an estimated 2.7% in the second quarter, versus expectations for 2.9% growth.Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) declined from 4.3% last month to 3.7%, above the consensus estimate of a 3.9% increase. This data point underscores that while inflationary pressures has moderated, it remains elevated.The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) latest meeting earlier this month, released on Wednesday, emphasized the same with more than 10 separate references to either inflation or wage growth as “elevated.” Crypto markets will continue to scrutinize the Federal Reserve governors’ evolving inflation prescriptions, particularly if price increases fall outside expectations.Currently, the CME FedWatch tool is assigning a 75% probability to the FOMC boosting interest rates by 25 basis points during the upcoming March 22 meeting. A week prior, the probability was 85%, indicating that the likelihood of a more aggressive 50 basis point hike has increased.Fed meeting minutes indicate that “a few participants” favored raising the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at the prior meeting. The more aggressive hike would “more quickly” bring the target rate to levels facilitating price stability."
18,2023-02-23,"Bitcoin dipped early Thursday but regained its footing near $24,000 as investors continued to weigh the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting earlier this month and the latest economic data.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at 23,921, a 0.5% gain from Wednesday, same time but down from its weekly high of over $25,000, according to CoinDesk data. Crypto markets have been struggling to gain traction amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.“The market has not been able to kind of get over that hump,” Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, told CoinDesk in an interview.“Until we do that, I think there continues to be the risk that it's possible that we're still in this big consolidation off of that downtrend that we saw,” he said.Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was up 2.1% to recently trade at $1,650. The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was up 1.1% for the day.Equities markets edged higher, with the S&P 500 index recently up 0.5% after a four-day sell-off.Wednesday's FOMC minutes release offered monetary doves and hawks alike some hope, although the heavy likelihood of a 25 basis point rate hike was unchanged.The CME FedWatch Tool shows that less than three in four traders currently foresee a 25 basis-point hike, while over one in four expect a 50 basis-point hike at the FOMC’s next meeting in March.In an email to CoinDesk, Bob Ras, co-founder of exchange and digital asset ecosystem Sologenic, wrote that while the central bank’s continued monetary tightening could dampen the crypto market’s performance, Asian central banks, including Japan and China, have been injecting liquidity into their respective markets, suggesting the recent rally ""still has legs.""“The amount of quantitative easing in Japan alone has been truly astronomical – so much so that this form of yield curve control has all but negated the tightening performed by the Fed over the last year,” Ras wrote, adding that “bitcoin and crypto are particularly sensitive to these kinds of fluctuations” as the money supply abroad is expanding.CORRECTION (Feb. 23, 2023, 23:11 UTC): Joel Kruger works at LMAX Group.

20,2023-02-23,"Bitcoin's (BTC) resurgence this year has convinced many analysts the crypto bear market has ended and the path of least resistance is to the higher side. QCP Capital suggests otherwise.According to the Singapore-based crypto options trading giant, bitcoin's 47% year-to-date rally looks like a ""bear breather"" within a broader slide that began November 2021, and the final leg of the bear market could soon resume.The analysis is based on Elliot Wave theory introduced by Ralph Nelson Elliott in 1938 in his book, ""The Wave Principle."" The theory assumes that asset price movements can be predicted by observing and identifying a repetitive wave pattern.Elliott found that market trends unfold in five waves, of which Waves 1, 3, and 5 are ""impulse waves"" representing the primary trend. Waves 2 and 4 are ""retrace waves,"" representing a temporary ""breather"" to the preceding impulse waves. An important rule is that the first wave tends to be roughly the same size as the fifth, and the third wave is usually the longest.In QCP's analysis, bitcoin's slide from November 2021's record high of $69,000 to the January 2022 low of $39,000 represents Wave 1 and the subsequent bounce to $48,000 through March 2022 represents Wave 2 – a bear breather, or temporary partial retrace of the preceding slide.The crash from $48,000 to the November 2022 low of $15,480 represents Wave 3, and the recent bounce constitutes Wave 4 – a bear breather similar to Wave 2.Next up is Wave 5, which in QCP's analysis could push the cryptocurrency down to the Wave 3 low of $15,480, if not deeper.""A potential double top is forming against the August 2022 correction high, and May 2022 reaction is low at 25,300,"" QCP Capital's market insights team said in an update published Wednesday. ""Above that, we have the huge 28,800-30,000 resistance, which is the Head and Shoulders neckline. Until these levels break, our 5 wave count still remains valid, with a final Wave 5 lower to come.""QCP's analysis comes a week after former Goldman Sachs analyst William Noble told CoinDesk that the cryptocurrency is primed for a rally toward $56,000.Identifying waves is an art. It is a subjective call. Each wave can can be broken down into sub-waves, as seen below, which makes the analysis quite challenging compared with traditional Dow Theory.The chart by QCP shows the five-wave bearish structure, with the fifth and final wave lower yet to unfold.Wave 4, identified by the year-to-date gain, has stalled around $25,000, a resistance level dating back to the August 2022 high. A turn lower now would confirm a potential double, as pointed out by QCP, and may signal the beginning of the Wave 5 sell-off.The bearish five-wave structure will be invalidated should the ongoing Wave 4 rises above the resistance range of $28,800-$30,000.Bitcoin changed hands at $24,300 at press time, per CoinDesk data."

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped near $23,600 in the immediate aftermath of the FOMC report, which noted slowing growth – a boon for investors hoping for more dovish Federal Reserve monetary policy – but also data suggesting that inflation and the prospects of a harsh recession remained real, pleasing monetary hawks.""Everyone's wary of what's to come over the course of this year,"" Jake Boyle, chief commercial officer at crypto brokerage Caleb and Brown, said on CoinDesk TV. ""At this point it looks like the stance has become more conservative on the basis that 25 basis points is less impactful than 50, but it's critical that we all remember that it is still going up, which means that the solution is clearly not there.""Boyle added: ""Paired with the regulatory uncertainty that the crypto space is seeming to have these days, it would be fair for us to make the assumption that there is going to be further volatility and unexpected announcements over the course of this year.""Ether was recently changing hands at $1,641, off 1.1% from Tuesday, same time. Yet, CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams noted that BTC and ETH were diverging on a different front, with investors sending bitcoin to exchanges and removing ether from them. The moves have signaled bearish sentiment for bitcoin and bullishness for ether, a departure from their usual correlation. Separately, on Tuesday layer 2 scaling system Arbitrum surpassed Ethereum in daily transactions, increasing Arbitrum’s dominance as the leading layer 2 rollup.Other major cryptos were mixed with some ticking up a little but others slightly in the green, although APT, the token of layer 1 platform Aptos, recently climbed more than 6%.Stocks fell amid the same inflationary and recessionary fears that have bedeviled markets for the past few days with the S&P 500, which has a tech-heavy component, dropping 0.2%, its fourth consecutive daily decline, and the technology-focused Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) also edging down slightly.Crypto news ranged from upbeat to reminders of cryptos' nearly 15 months of sturm und drang. Investment banking giant JPMorgan said in a research report that crypto exchange Coinbase is well positioned to deliver notable year-on-year improvement in EBITDA."" But a legal filing by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said it has started an investigation into bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital and its executives for deceptive marketing of cryptocurrency.In an email to CoinDesk, Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, a decentralized blockchain for non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrencies and Web3 technology, wrote optimistically that ""the slightly better than forecasted earnings reported by Coinbase might suggest that we have moved into the final innings of a crypto winter.""""Clearly, there has been more interest in the digital asset market in recent months, as evidenced by a rally that took a lot of observers by surprise. Part of this has to do with market psychology – everyone was so incredibly bearish that the obvious counter-trade was to be bullish. Coinbase has also been able to increase its overall market share on the back of the fallout of large crypto marketplaces like FTX.""Georgiades was particularly sanguine about cryptos' prospects in Asia: ""There is a lot of speculation that buyers in Asia are starting to scale back into crypto in increasing amounts. As a result, the strength in the digital asset market may very well continue for the foreseeable future. Even if the Fed remains hawkish for months to come, what’s happening in other parts of the world in monetary easing might be enough to offset what’s happening in the United States.""But he added that ""there could be deep pullbacks in bitcoin and crypto to come,"" even if ""the fodder for an enduring rally seems to be there.”Hundreds of Fake ChatGPT Tokens Are Luring Crypto Investors; Majority Issued on BNB ChainThis story first appeared Feb. 21 on CoinDesk.Nefarious market participants are attempting to cash in on the ongoing ChatGPT craze in technology circles by issuing fake tokens branded after the artificial intelligence chatbot despite having no official association with the tool.Hundreds of such tokens have been issued in the past few weeks. Of this, 132 different tokens have been issued on BNB Chain, 25 tokens on Ethereum and 10 separate tokens on other blockchains such as Solana, Arbitrum, OKChain and Cronos.These fake issuances follow software giant Microsoft’s move to integrate OpenAI’s chatbots for search services on Microsoft’s internet browsers.While OpenAI is the creator of ChatGPT, Microsoft’s own chatbot is a bespoke tool and is said to be an improvement over the publicly accessible ChatGPT.Scammers are not wasting a chance to monetize on the hype, however. Several “BingChatGPT” have been issued, seeded with liquidity and are seeing thousands of dollars in trading volumes – despite red flags.“PeckShield has detected dozens of newly created #BingChatGPT tokens, of which 3 appear to be #honeypots & 2 have high sell tax,” blockchain security firm PeckShield said in a tweet Monday.“2 of them have already dropped over -99%. Deployer 0xb583 has already created dozens of tokens with a pump & dump scheme,” PeckShield added, referring to the wallet address of the nefarious issuer of these tokens.In cryptocurrency, honeypots are smart contracts that pretend to leak their funds to an arbitrary user, provided that the user sends additional funds to it.On the other hand, sales tax refers to the intentional amount of money taken by an illicit smart contract when a related token is sold – usually amounts higher than 50%, meaning a user selling $100 worth of a token receives only $50 worth, with the remaining “taxed” amount going to the developer of that smart contact.At writing time on Tuesday, there are over 170 ChatGPT-branded tokens issued on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap, data from DEXTools shows.Read More: Here’s Why Artificial Intelligence Focused Cryptocurrencies Are Vastly Outperforming BitcoinThe most popular one has a market capitalization of over $250 million, with more than 300 unique holders and $600,000 in liquidity and is issued on Ethereum. A separate BNB Chain-version has $246,000 in liquidity and a market capitalization of $24 million.Trading volumes on such fake tokens – and scams in some cases – are a glimpse of the crypto punting dream being alive and well.9:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:00 UTC) Eurozone Core Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (YoY/Jan)12:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(4:30 UTC) United States Gross Domestic Product Annualized (Q4) 10:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(14:30 UTC) Japan National Consumer Price Index (YoY0/Jan)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Coinbase’s Earnings Beat Expectations; SEC’s Shadow Crypto Rule Taking Shape as Enforcement Cases MountCoinbase reported Q4 earnings after the bell Tuesday, beating expectations, but usage continues to decline.

22,2023-02-22,"Bitcoin and ether have parted ways in the inflow to and outflow from exchanges.Net position metrics show that Investors are sending bitcoin to exchanges and removing ether from them. The moves imply bearish sentiment for BTC and bullishness for ETH, a departure from their more typical correlated paths.Exchange balances tend to increase when investors are considering selling an asset, or at least placing themselves in positions to do so quickly. Investors removing assets from exchanges implies that investors are looking to hold the asset.The current trends don't necessarily predict longer-term future investor action, but they are noteworthy. Bitcoin trending bearishly would run opposite its average performance following a ""golden cross,"" such as the one that the asset reached Feb. 18. Bitcoin’s price rose an average 8% following the seven golden crosses since 2015 that preceded the latest one.A golden cross occurs when the price of an asset’s 50-day moving average surpasses its 200-day moving average.Motivations?What’s behind the latest movements?BTC prices remain up 42% year to date, and investors may be unable to ignore the temptation of realizing profits. A key point to watch will be whether BTC movement onto exchanges rises. The current increase has been mild, which may reflect more that investors are looking to manage risk as the market seems to be emerging from a period of contraction than negativity.ETH activity has been more pronounced because its exchange net position change has been negative in each of the last 13 days. ETH was removed from exchanges even as prices declined 10% between Feb. 7 and Feb. 13.Year to date, BTC has outperformed ETH by approximately 8%, despite ether’s supply declining by 33,000 ETH since September.The difference between BTC and ETH in exchange net position has not extended to the derivatives space. Funding rates for both bitcoin and ether remain positive, indicating that long-position traders are willing to compensate short-position traders to maintain their bullish stance."
23,2023-02-22,"The minutes from the Jan. 31-Feb. 1 meeting of the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) suggested both hawkish and dovish sentiments among the participants, but notably missing was any discussion of a pause in the U.S. central bank's rate hike cycle.""Almost all participants observed that slowing the pace of rate increases at the current juncture would allow for appropriate risk management,"" according to the minutes of the meeting, at which the Fed hiked the fed funds rate by 25 basis points, a slowdown from the 50- and 75-basis points hikes that became the norm through much of 2022.For the doves, some participants noted a softening in the growth in consumer demand. On the hawkish side, though, some at the meeting said some measures of financial conditions had eased over the past few months – perhaps inconsistent with the degree of policy restraint necessary to bring inflation back to its 2% target.Bitcoin (BTC) was down more than 3% for the day at around $23,800 prior to the news release, and currently remains around that level.Bloomberg's David Wilcox found only one mention of the word ""pause"" in the minutes and that was in reference to other central banks. This is somewhat notable as markets as recently as three weeks ago had priced in a pause in the Fed's rate hikes in May (after one more 25 basis point rate hike in March). After a raft of strong economic data and a number of hawkish Fed speakers, markets now anticipate not just another 25 basis point hike in May, but the chance of the central bank hiking by 50 basis points in March.That change in sentiment has helped push U.S. Treasury yields sharply higher, with the 10-year Treasury yield at more than a three-month high of 3.92% and the two-year yield to more than a 15-year high of 4.70%. Also, bitcoin has been unable to continue its bullish 2023 run, falling back from the $25,000 level three times over the past week."
24,2023-02-22,"The bitcoin (BTC) market is showing an uncanny resilience in the face of renewed investor anxiety on Wall Street.Data from CryptoCompare shows the Bitcoin Volatility Index (BVIN), which measures the implied or expected volatility over the next 30 days, has remained flat of late near the lower end of its three-month range of 60 to 100. Implied volatility is often equated with the degree of uncertainty or anxiety in the market.Meanwhile, the Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) – commonly referred to as Wall Street's fear gauge – has jumped from 18 to 23 over the past three days, reaching a 2023 high.Alongside, the MOVE index, which measures volatility in U.S. Treasurys, has jumped to a one-month high of 120, ending a four-month downtrend.Bitcoin's lack of participation in global volatility repricing is reminiscent of the pre-March 2020 days when traditional investors took little interest in digital assets, leaving the crypto market in its own world. Bitcoin only evolved as a macro asset after the crash of March 2020, with BVIN typically closely tracking movements in VIX ever since.""We attribute this correlation break to reflect a continued mainstream dis-interest in crypto products, as we return to the fringes of U.S. capital markets and chart our own narratives forward with hopefully more uncorrelated alpha,"" SignalPlus Ltd, a tech firm focused on democratizing crypto options, said in its daily market report.The most popular narrative since late 2022 is that bitcoin will repeat history by rallying sharply in the months leading up to its fourth mining reward halving due sometime in March 2024. Reward halving refers to a programmed code that reduces the pace of bitcoin's supply expansion by 50% every four years.""The conditions are ripe for a breakthrough in 2023 that could catalyze a new bull market,"" San Francisco crypto asset manager Bitwise wrote last month, taking note of the crypto's tendency to rally ahead of the halving. ""We are excited by the growth of layer 2 solutions, the development of ZK-rollups and privacy solutions, and many other emergent capabilities of crypto,"" the team added.As for the jump in volatility in traditional assets, these markets have turned nervous in response to rates traders – factoring in recent upbeat economic data – quickly reversing bets on potential easing by the Federal Reserve later this year.Markets were previously certain the Fed would hike its benchmark fed funds rate just 25 basis points in March, but are now showing a 20% probability of a 50 basis point move. The yield on the two-year Treasury note has increased by more than 50 basis points to 4.64% in February. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, has bounced from 102.00 to 104.00 as international money flows take advantage of higher yields.""The risk of a 'break higher' in the economy with higher prices is a much bigger risk than recession concerns at this juncture,"" SignalPlus said. ""Equities were on borrowed time against the move in rates and FX."""
25,2023-02-22,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin can't seem to break past the $25K mark. But when it does, $30K is the next important milestone. Here's why.Insights: Some of crypto's China narrative is old, some of it is new. Is the market treating this irrationally?$30,000 is Bitcoin's Next Important MilestoneBitcoin is lingering around $24,400 as Asia begins its business day, down 1.6% in the last 24 hours. Ether has also experienced a slight correction too, down 2.3% to $1,661.Some of the ""China coins"" that surged over the last week are also seeing a slight correction. Conflux (CFX), which is up a staggering 485% during the last week, is down 4.7% on the day.Gareth Soloway, chief market strategist at Verified Investing, says the China narrative continues to be what’s attracting new bitcoin buyers.“The big question is, in spite of interest rates going up and the dollar gaining strength, is there a catalyst that can push it over [$25,000]?” he said during an interview on CoinDesk TV. “I think this narrative out of Hong Kong could be something that helps.”Soloway points to the 200-weekly moving average as being $25,000, which creates a strong resistance level with some headwinds.“If we can punch through $25,000 and get above that level, it’s a straight shot to $30,000,” he said.That figure is important because in 2021, he says, $30,000 was the midpoint low for the year. Prices came down from an April 2021 high of $60,000 to $30,000 at the end of July before rallying back to around $69,000 in November.“If we can retrace and get back above $30K, that would solidify that the lows are in for crypto,” he said. “I still think that there are some nervous issues out there the market has to resolve, but $30K being recaptured would put that to rest.”Any token that’s China-related is currently off to the moon.Conflux (CFX) has risen 467% during the last week, according to CoinGecko data, while NEO is up 51% and filecoin (FIL) is up 60%.The ""China narrative"" has been used to sell the next bull market.But what exactly is this narrative?Some of it is new, some of it is old. And some of it is more hype than substance.Hong Kong and retail crypto tradersHong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is starting a consultation process for licensing crypto exchanges to serve retail investors. The SFC spent the last few years working on a consultation plan for Professional (accredited) investors, which goes live on June 1.Stablecoins are also set to be regulated in the city, and it's likely that they will be using locally incorporated institutions and trusts.CoinDesk has asked Tether, Circle and Paxos if they would be interested in applying to be regulated under Hong Kong’s proposed stablecoin regime – so far none have responded.Don’t expect super-leveraged crypto degeneracy when this launches. Regulators are talking about things like ""approved tokens"" and ""risk profile."" This is likely going to be a controlled, calm walled garden of crypto.Crypto is already widely available in ChinaOfficials from China’s Liaison Office are apparently interested in Hong Kong’s progress with crypto, and have been reportedly stopping by conferences and meetups in the City.Some say that this is a blessing. China can study Hong Kong’s approach to crypto much like it learned from Hong Kong about open markets.Still, there is no shortage of crypto available in China, through domestic payment rails.Both OKX and Binance offer active over-the-counter crypto markets for USDT, ether, bitcoin and other major cryptos. Payment is done via WeChat or a domestic bank transfer.Anyone who wants crypto in China already has it.Conflux and blockchain SIMsPart of Conflux’s sharp rise has been attributed to its announcement that it is working with China Telecom to build blockchain-based SIM cards, complete with all the Web3 terminology to get people excited like metaverse and proof of work.But Blockchain SIM cards aren’t anything new. This isn’t China Telecom’s first attempt at it.Back in 2018, China’s telecoms started to explore blockchain technology. In 2019, China Telecom began pitching the idea of a blockchain SIM with the buzzwords of the day: internet of value, internet of things, 5G. A deck advertising the technology from 2020 talked about how digital ledgers could help carriers reconcile billings.A spokesperson for China Telecom didn’t respond to a request for more technical details by press time.Around the same time, Verizon won a patent for a blockchain-based SIM card it was calling vSIM. Verizon’s exact approach didn’t win out, and what it was describing has become eSIMs.It’s also important to remember the Conflux operating within China isn’t the same Conflux you access with the CFX token.The version of Conflux that has been funded by various provincial governments in China, such as Hunan and Shanghai’s city government, doesn’t have a token and uses a made-in-China encryption protocol. The same team is behind it, and the tech is mostly the same, but China’s version of the chain doesn’t touch the global version.Tony Ling, a China-based partner at Bizantine Capital, calls Conflux a “one country, two systems” blockchain, noting that its chain and performance is strong but development has been restricted due to compliance with domestic policy.“It has no [cryptocurrency] in China, it may be somewhat different from traditional public chains,” he said. “Conflux is the only public chain recognized by the government in China.”What’s old is new againFinding the catalyst for China’s crypto boom is tough.Hong Kong allowing retail crypto is a long way off. Authorities there are only in the consultation stage, and even when it launches it's going to be a controlled environment.That said, crypto is already widely available in China, albeit through gray channels like OTC desks. But it’s as simple as using a virtual private network to access Binance or OKX then completing a transaction with WeChat Pay.Conflux has been around for a while. Blockchain SIMs aren’t a new idea and haven’t yet taken off.Maybe it’s just the economy? China’s ""home team"" tokens are rising because the stock market is up.Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at Oanda, outlined this thesis in an earlier interview with CoinDesk.“The bullish case for the Chinese economy remains solid, and the likely release of stimulus over the next couple of months as it gathers pace could supercharge that,” he told CoinDesk in an email. “Domestic demand is going to be the cornerstone of the economic revival, and policymakers appear poised to unleash that to its full potential.”The Hang Seng Index is up 4% in the last six months as the market looks forward to China’s post-COVID-19 reopening and domestic consumption coming back.Time to see how strong the correlation with crypto is.9:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:00 UTC) New Zealand Monetary Policy Statement 3:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:00 UTC) Germany Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (YoY/Jan)6:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(10:00 UTC) United States Federal Open Markets Committee MinutesIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:BNB-Bitcoin Ratio Falls to Lowest Level Since August; Custodia Bank CEO on State of Crypto RegulationBNB, the native token of the Binance-initiated blockchain network BNB Chain, is losing ground against bitcoin (BTC) in the wake of regulatory action against Binance-branded dollar-pegged stablecoin BUSD.

26,2023-02-21,"The native tokens of shared storage protocols have soared over the past week, with an analyst attributing the surge to the platforms' increased usage.Decentralized storage network Filecoin’s native utility FIL has been among the top performers, soaring from just above $5 a week ago to $8.10 on Tuesday, a more than 62% gain, according to CoinDesk data. FIL has outperformed bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), which have risen 10% and 7%, in the past seven days, respectively.FIL’s jump comes as Filecoin readies its Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) for a March unveiling. The FVM creates a “runtime environment” for smart contracts. It is expected to enable “new applications for smart contracts,” leading to increased usage, Messari research analyst Mihai Grigore told CoinDesk in an email.Colin Evran, ecosystem lead at Protocol Labs, the company behind Filecoin, tweeted that writing smart contracts on Filecoin allows users to “create perpetual storage contracts” and their own “storage market,” “on-chain cloud solutions,” “data DAOs” and “DeFi contracts.”Other computing and storage networks, including cloud storage networks Storj (STORJ) and Siacoin (SC), have climbed 16% for the week. The CoinDesk Computing Index, which measures the market capitalization weighted performance of computing protocols, was up 16% over the past week.“Competitive pricing, relative to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), makes decentralized storage an appealing choice for Web2 entities seeking cost-effective alternatives for storing large amounts of archival data,” Grigore said.On Tuesday, BTC was recently trading at about $24,273, down 2.2%, while ETH was changing hands at $1,647, off 3.5%.Crypto exchange Bitfinex's analysts said bitcoin’s recent rally to over $25,000 last week was driven by both “over-leveraged long positions” and ""liquidating over-eager shorts.” Investors holding long positions believe an asset will increase in value, while those who hold short positions see an asset decreasing in value.Data from crypto data provider Coinglass shows that traders who bet on price increases liquidated $130 million of their long positions, while those who bet on price falls liquidated around $179 million of their BTC short positions in the past seven days.“Historically, this type of price action, where both the longs and shorts are wiped off simultaneously, has resulted in a range formation,” Bitfinex's analysts wrote in an emailed comment, adding: “The most probable move going forward is to scale out of positions partially and wait for the range to form without a strong directional bias.”"
27,2023-02-21,"Bitcoin breached a rare “Golden Cross” over the weekend, a bullish signal that typically foreshadows short-term gains.Prices have increased 1% since the latest cross occurred.A Golden Cross occurs when the 50-day moving average for an asset crosses above the 200-day moving average. Bitcoin’s latest cross occurred on Feb 18. Bitcoin has seen only six other crosses since 2015. The most recent prior to this latest cross was on Aug. 14, 2021.A cross reflects BTC’s exponential moving averages (EMA) and not the simple moving average (SMA). The calculation of an asset’s EMA weighs more recent pricing data, whereas SMAs measure each date equally.Investors opt for one or the other depending on their personal preferences. The SMA group would have seen a cross occur Feb. 7.Prices initially declined 5.7% in the next two consecutive days but have since rebounded 13%, calculating out to a 6.6% increase since its occurrence.Bitcoin’s performance following a cross has traditionally been strong, with the average seven- and 30-day returns of 3.8% and 8.3%, respectively.These percentages compare favorably to seven- and 30-day returns of 1.6% and 7.5% over the entirety of the dataset, indicating the acquiring BTC following a golden cross has been positive. A look back at the SMA crossover shows six other occurrences since 2015, with average seven- and 30-day returns of 2.7% and 10.6%, respectively.Performing to the average would imply that bitcoin prices will breach $26,500, given its closing price on Feb 18. The current price for BTC has been flirting with $25,000, a psychologically important level, which has been challenging for the asset to hold.In each of the four most recent trading days, BTC has alternated between positive and negative gains on average volume, providing little clear direction for sentiment at the moment."
28,2023-02-21,"Bitcoin's (BTC) upswing has come to a screeching halt at a price level that proved to be a tough nut to crack last year.The leading cryptocurrency by market cap picked up a strong bid at the start of the year and has gained nearly 50% since then, outperforming major traditional risk assets. However, the bullish momentum has stalled since Feb. 16, with the cryptocurrency failing multiple times to secure a foothold above the $25,000 mark. The said level offered stiff resistance in August, following which the cryptocurrency revisited lows around $18,000.According to Laurent Kssis, a crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital, a breakout above $25,000 hinges on the performance of technology companies.""Tech firms performed horrendously last year, and it's all down to how well they recover in the first quarter. That's why BTC is not pushing further,"" Kssis told CoinDesk. Technology stocks will announce the first-quarter earnings after March.Bitcoin tends to move in synch with Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq index. Recently, the 90-day correlation coefficient between the two strengthened to 0.75. Nasdaq fell by 2.4% last week, pausing a four-week winning streak that offered positive cues to high-risk assets like bitcoin.Kssis added that crypto traders are currently parking money in world's biggest dollar-pegged stablecoin tether (USDT) and the bitcoin rally will resume once that trend ends.""The market is patiently awaiting realized profits that are parked in USDT right now to pile back into bitcoin and ether. This is why we ran out of breath to break $25,000,"" Kssis said. ""When BTC is rallying, USDT dominance tends to thin out.""Data from charting platform TradingView show, tether's dominance, or the stablecoin's share of the total crypto market valuation, has steadied around 6.5% since late January, a sign of traders rotating money into the stablecoin, as Kssis said. USDT's dominance fell from nearly 9% to 6.5% in January as bitcoin rallied.According to Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko, heightened regulatory risks have dented sentiment in the market, and ""volatility is unlikely to go away.""Last week, the U.S. regulatory agencies specifically called out Paxos for its BUSD product and not Pax dollar, hinting at an indirect action against Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volumes. BUSD is a Binance-branded dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Paxos.Since then, long-term and short-term call-put skews have retreated to zero, indicating a neutral sentiment in the options market. Call-put skews measure the cost of bullish call options relative to bearish put options and are widely tracked to gauge sentiment among sophisticated institutional players and retail investors.""The options market had been demonstrating bullish leanings but now maintain a neutral outlook on the market,"" analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex said in a report shared with CoinDesk. ""Investors now place roughly equal value on put and call options.""Besides, there is evidence of investors pulling money out of crypto funds. Per data tracked by CoinShares, digital asset investment products saw outflows totaling $32 million last week, the largest since late December 2022. Bitcoin funds alone bled nearly $25 million, while short bitcoin funds saw an inflow of $3.7 million.Griffin Blofin, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said concerns about sticky inflation have resurfaced since last week, stalling the rally in risk assets.""The expectation of an inflation rebound has appeared in many markets. Both the U.S. January CPI and the latest U.K. PMI data point to a relatively strong economy, raising the possibility of a resurgence of overheating. The above means that the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank must maintain a hawkish policy and even return to the pace of each interest rate hike of 50 basis points,"" Ardern told CoinDesk.At press time, the fed funds futures show a 15% chance of the central bank lifting rates by 50 basis points next month, while in Europe, a similar-sized hike in March is all but priced in.Meanwhile, bitcoin changed hands at $24,650. Some market participants expect a potential breakout above the technical resistance at $25,000 to bring a sharp rally.""We have tested the 25k resistance multiple times over the past week and failed. Hearing the view from our clients that we could gap higher if we meaningfully break the range,"" Paradigm said in a Telegram broadcast late Monday."
29,2023-02-21,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.FTX bankruptcy claims are being picked up for 20 cents on the dollar in private over-the-counter (OTC) markets. The distressed asset fund managers doing so are projecting around a 50 cents on the dollar recovery in five years, an anonymous FTX creditor told CoinDesk. Most of the deals are private as not all claims are fungible. ""There may also be a clawback period for those who tried to withdraw leading up to the bankruptcy, so the quality of claims is important,"" the source said. FTX, which went bankrupt in November, has an estimated 1 million creditors, with the 50 largest being owed a combined $3.1 billion.Factor, the decentralized digital asset management platform built on Ethereum scaler Arbitrum, attracted over $4.3 million in trades in the first 12 hours after going live. Factor’s aim is to allow developers to be able to offer tokenized baskets, yield pools or derivative offerings to community users. Depositors to these products will profit from the upside created by those developers, who themselves earn a cut of fees. The initial coin offering for Factor’s FCTR token started with a $10 million target and will last for three more days, after which the resulting pool of money will be distributed to determine the initial price of FCTR in the open market.The Litecoin network has effectively gotten its first non-fungible token (NFT) after a copy of its mimblewimble upgrade was placed on the platform’s blockchain. Bitcoin developer Anthony Gurrera forked the code behind Bitcoin ordinals to the Litecoin network, answering a challenge from a Twitter user who offered a public bounty of 15 LTC ($1,410) to the first party to fork Ordinals to Litecoin.

30,2023-02-21,"BNB, the native token of the Binance-initiated blockchain network BNB Chain, is losing ground against bitcoin (BTC) in the wake of regulatory action against Binance-branded dollar-pegged stablecoin BUSD.The BNB/BTC ratio listed on Binance, the world's largest exchange by trading volume, slipped to 0.01257 early Tuesday, reaching the lowest since Aug. 2, 2022.The pair has declined by nearly 13% after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said last Tuesday that it is suing Paxos for violating investor protection laws by issuing BUSD, which the regulator deems as an unregistered security. The SEC action was accompanied by an order from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) asking Paxos to stop minting BUSD.""BNB token has underperformed the broad market in February as the Paxos-BUSD situation continues to weigh on the exchange, which experienced massive outflows last week,"" Paris-based Kaiko said in a weekly report. ""The BNB to BTC price ratio, which measures the relative performance of the two tokens, fell to its lowest level since August 2022.""The flow of money out of BNB, once touted as a safe haven, and into bitcoin perhaps stems from the belief that the regulatory crackdown against BUSD is actually a move against Binance.While BUSD is issued and redeemed by Paxos, the stablecoin is marketed by Binance. In September, Binance delisted USD coin (USDC), Paxos dollar (USDP) and trueUSD (TUSD) for BUSD.""Since the NYDFS and SEC specifically called out Paxos for its BUSD product and not Pax dollar, it’s possible that the enforcement is more about particulars involving BUSD than a broad attack on stablecoins generally,"" Galaxy Research's Alex Thorn said in a note to clients on Friday. ""This indicates that these agencies are particularly targeting Binance rather than stablecoins in general – at least at this time.""If that's not enough, the move by SEC and NYDFS aligns with Binance's recent decision to suspend dollar transfers and its admission of gaps in regulatory compliance. The exchange is now expecting fines for past misconduct.The ratio peaked in November as the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's exchange brought increased scrutiny to Binance and other crypto exchanges.""BNB had mostly outperformed BTC until November 2022, when the ratio started trending downwards as sentiment deteriorated following the collapse of FTX,"" Kaiko said, adding that the token can be interpreted as a proxy of the exchange's performance.Per some observers, BNB/BTC's slide represents peak pessimism, often observed at market bottoms.""Buying BNB here. Think we're close to peak FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt] and the BNB/BTC ratio shows it,"" crypto hedge fund Ouroboros Capital said in a tweet thread last week, drawing attention to Binance's increasing market share and growing BNB Chain ecosystem."
31,2023-02-21,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin is starting the day in Asia at $24,815. What's going to drive it higher?Insights: A report by a Canadian judge considered the government's use of the Emergencies Act to quell a ""Freedom Convoy"" protest focused on Ottawa last year, but avoided recommending additional crypto regulation. The document may say more about officials' ongoing uncertainties in addressing issues related to digital assets.China, Enthusiasm, and Euphoria Might Drive Bitcoin to the Next Support LevelMonday was a holiday in the U.S. in honor of Presidents’ Day, but crypto never sleeps.Bitcoin is opening the day in Asia up 1.9% to $24,815, while ether is up 1% to $1,701.China-themed layer 1 protocols experienced quite a surge this week. Conflux is up 500% during the last week, while NEO is up 70%. Both are up around 40% in the last day.Last week Conflux announced it is partnering with China Telecom to build blockchain-based SIM cards. It’s important to remember, however, that the Conflux Network within China is a separate, tokenless, government-approved blockchain used in conjunction with the country’s Blockchain Service Network.Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, says that solid economic data from a post-COVID-19, re-opened China is going to drive up stocks and crypto prices.“The bullish case for the Chinese economy remains solid, and the likely release of stimulus over the next couple of months as it gathers pace could supercharge that,” he told CoinDesk in an email. “Domestic demand is going to be the cornerstone of the economic revival, and policymakers appear poised to unleash that to its full potential.”While crypto and stocks might be on an upward trajectory, Erlam doesn’t see gold going in the same direction.“Gold traders do not share the eternal optimism that equity and crypto traders possess, and recent weeks have highlighted that perfectly,” he said. “The yellow metal fell into a corrective pattern and has struggled to get out since.”This week might be a slow one with the U.S. holiday on Monday and not much scheduled for economic events in the U.S. and Europe, but it could be the start of a breakout for bitcoin, with price gains based on enthusiasm alone.“Cryptos are seemingly existing in a world of their own, with bitcoin rising 2% again on Monday and eyeing the highs of the last week once more,” he said. “This could be a really pivotal level for bitcoin and a break of it could generate plenty more enthusiasm. And we've all seen what happens when enthusiasm and euphoria exist in cryptos.”Crypto Regulation Missing From Canada Inquiry Into Emergencies ActThe long-awaited report from the inquiry into the Canadian government’s use of the Emergencies Act to quell last year’s ""Freedom Convoy"" protest centered in Ottawa was released Friday afternoon.For observers of Canadian politics, the inquiry, led by Justice Paul Rouleau was fascinating. But despite crypto acting as an important fundraising mechanism, and protesters using crypto to openly defy the country’s first-ever crypto-related sanctions, absent from Justice’s Rouleau were recommendations for strengthening controls on digital assets.Revelations from the hearingsIn the early weeks of the hearings, which occurred last November, the revelations came fast and furious: Canada’s national intelligence agency did not consider the protests a national security threat and warned that invoking the Emergencies Act would only radicalize protesters. Police were largely sympathetic to protesters and provided a “steady stream” of leaks to organizers. Despite early claims that Russia was backing the protest, intelligence officials revealed that it was largely Canadian-funded.Most of Rouleau’s recommendations address the inter-jurisdictional squabbling that defined the first few weeks of the protest.Buried in the last pages of the 56-recommendation report is Rouleau’s crypto-related recommendation – the 54th.“The federal government should continue with its study into cryptocurrencies. This study should be informed by the findings of this Commission,” Rouleau wrote. “Federal officials should seek to collaborate with counterparts at other levels of government to benefit from existing study in this area and to ensure that any jurisdictional issues may be addressed.”Bitcoin ‘defied government crackdown’Central to the financing of the protest was bitcoin.Traditional crowdfunding platforms such as GoFundMe and GiveSendGo had exposure to Canadian banking rails, and were frozen after an Ontario Superior Court judge issued a Mareva injunction ordering the platforms and their banking partners to cease facilitating the Convoy’s transactions.But the Convoy’s bitcoin remained outside of the Court’s control.As CoinDesk reported in February last year, most of the bitcoin wallets were completely drained, according to on-chain data. Nearly all of the 20 BTC (about $788,000 U.S. at last year’s exchange rates) was moved to other, non-sanctioned wallets, with some landing at major centralized exchanges.Among bitcoin’s true believers, this was an exemplification of the digital asset’s perfect use case: censorship-resistant money.“Bitcoin proved itself to be a sovereign financial rail as hundreds of thousands of dollars in BTC reached protesters in spite of government efforts to block donations,” Bitcoin magazine wrote in June. “Its use as a system for getting hundreds of thousands of dollars in value directly into the hands of those who had been blacklisted by the Canadian government may be the most potent illustration of that power to date.”But this opinion isn’t universally shared within the crypto industry.In February 2022, CoinDesk columnist J.P. Koning wrote that bitcoin was a bad way to fund the Ottawa protest, and that funding an illegal protest in any currency isn’t right despite the government’s worrying use of the Emergencies Act, which he wrote made him “very uncomfortable.”“When protest becomes illegal, it's the task of the police to step in and break it up. Any inability to do so on their part hurts one of the other key pillars of a democratic society: rule of law. If the law no longer functions, Canada would quickly descend into a state of perpetual chaos,” Koning wrote.Canadian choke pointIn the U.S., there appears to be a whole-of-government approach to cracking down on the crypto industry.As Nic Carter, general partner at Castle Island Ventures, wrote in a recent blog post, crypto-fiat off-ramps in the U.S. are tightening. In early January, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) issued a joint statement discouraging banks from dealing with the crypto industry.Metropolitan Commercial Bank, which served exchanges like Crypto.com, ceased doing business with the industry shortly after. Binance quickly announced it will only process fiat transactions of over $100,000, due to a new policy at Signature Bank, before suspending USD bank transfers altogether for retail clients. Then, in late January, the Kansas City Fed denied Custodia’s application for a master account.Carter writes that this reminds him of the Obama-era ""Operation Choke Point,"" a scheme, as he describes it, as marginalizing specific industries operating legally by putting pressure on the banking sector.Canada isn’t immune from the same environment of tightening crypto regulations. CoinDesk reported in February that Canada’s umbrella markets regulator, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), is preparing for a new regulatory push. One source that spoke to CoinDesk said the new proposed rules will make doing business in Canada too expensive for exchanges.But the updates to these rules aren’t coming as a result of the Trucker Convoy’s blatant defiance of the country’s first crypto sanction.Despite Rouleau and the authorities knowing that bitcoin worked as intended for the protesters, allowing them to keep their coins so they can fight another day, increased crypto regulations won’t come as a result of this, but rather as a push to continually define crypto as a security.8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(12:30 a.m. UTC): Jibun Bank manufacturing PMI (Feb. preliminary)8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(12:30 a.m. UTC): Jibun Bank Services PMI (Feb. preliminary)6:30 a.m. HKT/SGT (2/22) 10:30 p.m. (UTC): Coinbase earningsIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""All About Bitcoin"" on CoinDesk TV:SEC Alleges Terraform's Ecosystem Is Simply 'Fraud;' Bitcoin's Strong WeekIt was a strong last week for bitcoin (BTC), with the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization seeing its biggest single daily gain in three months.

32,2023-02-20,"While most crypto app users worldwide lost money on their bitcoin holdings after last year's collapses of the Terra ecosystem and the FTX exchange, investors outside of major economies took the biggest hit, the Bank for International Settlements said in a report published on Monday.Losing money in risky investments isn't exactly a new phenomenon: Last year, American investors lost $9 trillion due to falling stock prices alone. More than $450 billion vanished from the crypto market following the collapse of Terra in May, 2022, and another $200 billion was lost following FTX's bankruptcy in November, the report said.The BIS is owned by owned by 63 central banks, representing countries from around the world that together account for about 95% of world GDP. BIS analyzed data from crypto exchange apps for 95 countries and on-chain data on the daily distribution of bitcoin holdings collected from IntoTheBlock. The data showed that from August 2015 to December 2022 almost three-quarters of users downloaded a crypto platform app when the price of bitcoin was above $20,000.""The median investor would have lost $431 by December 2022, corresponding to almost half of their total $900 in funds invested since downloading the app. Notably, this share is even higher in several emerging market economies like Brazil, India, Pakistan, Thailand and Turkey. If investors continued to invest at a monthly frequency, over four fifths of users would have lost money,"" the report said.The authors of the report assumed users invested in bitcoin ""on the same day they downloaded the app"" and that ""each new user bought $100 of bitcoin in the month of the first app download and in each subsequent month."" It's unclear how much these assumptions reflect reality – particularly whether downloading an app ensures the purchase of crypto.The report also said larger investors might have benefited at the expense of smaller ones. ""The price patterns suggest that larger investors were able to sell their assets to smaller ones before the steep price decline,"" it said.Following the market collapse, regulators who were previously more concerned about crypto's impact on financial stability, have pivoted to setting up stronger safeguards for retail investors.""Evidence suggests that crypto shocks have a limited impact on equity prices or broader financial conditions,"" the BIS report said.Read more: FTX Collapse Leaves Total Crypto Market Cap Under $800B, Close to 2022 Low"

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has published its proposed rules for crypto trading platforms. The regulator is seeking comments on whether to allow licensed platforms to serve retail investors and what consumer protection measures to offer. The new rules would also mean all platforms would need to apply for a license, including existing ones. Platforms “should begin to review and revise their systems and controls to prepare for the new regime,” the SFC said. It was misconstrued through a tweet last week that the city was set to offer crypto trading to retail investors, which is not the case. Hong Kong’s new Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) licensing regime kicks in at the start of June, but it only permits exchanges to provide access to professional investors.Helium is set to entirely shift to the Solana blockchain by March 27, developers have said. That’s prompted a rally of the decentralized wireless network’s HNT tokens, which are up nearly 6% at $3 in the last 24 hours. Following the migration, HNT, MOBILE and IOT will all be issued on the Solana network and continue to be the tokens in the Helium ecosystem. A new version of the Helium wallet app will become available, and users will also have the option of using Solana-based wallets like Phantom and Solfare.Crypto-focused hedge fund Galois Capital has shut down after losing a sizable portion of its assets during FTX’s collapse last year. Galois told CoinDesk last November that the $40 million stuck on FTX amounted to around half of its funds.

34,2023-02-20,"STX, the native token of Bitcoin layer 2 Stacks Network, is surging as the recent arrival of the Ordinals protocol has unleashed a new narrative of non-fungible tokens (NFT) and smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain.Stacks Network is a Bitcoin layer 2 companion chain for smart contracts focused on establishing the world's biggest and oldest blockchain programmable – a dominant feature of Ethereum and its competitors such as Solana, which currently account for a majority of global NFT and decentralized finance (DeFi) activity.Stacks has a separate ledger to store data outside the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing developers to build applications similar to those on Ethereum and Solana. STX, known for being the first token offering qualified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is used to incentivize Stacks miners and participants in the proposed Stacks bitcoin (sBTC) system, which is aimed at making bitcoin fully programmable.The token has risen nearly 50% to 60 cents in the past 24 hours, taking the month-to-date gain to 125%. Prices were quoted as high as 84 cents early Monday, the highest since May, CoinDesk data show. Meanwhile, market leader bitcoin (BTC) has risen just 6% this month.The outsized move comes as the crypto community goes gaga over Ordinals, which went live on Jan. 21, allowing users to inscribe references to digital art into small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. In other words, Ordinals are like drawing artwork directly on satoshi (sats), the lowest denomination of a bitcoin, while NFTs on Ethereum are analogous to an authenticity certificate from the creator that is separate from ether.The number of newly created Ordinals or NFTs inscribed directly into Satoshis on Bitcoin crossed the 100,000 mark last week, causing network congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain.Per Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Stacks, the growing popularity of Ordinals would bode well for layer 2 systems.""Ordinals on Bitcoin [layer 1] are complementary to Bitcoin NFTs on [layer 2s] like Stacks. Ordinals have a natural limit on the L1 scale, and L2s provide a clear scalability path,"" Ali tweeted Monday. ""Wallets like Xverse and & Hiro are amongst the first to release or work on Ordinals.""Activity in NFTs on Stacks has picked up in the wake of the Ordinals' rising popularity. Data from DappRadar shows trading volume on Gamma.io, a Stack-based Bitcoin NFT marketplace, has increased by more than 1,000% in the past 30 days. Meanwhile, volumes on Megapont have increased by 125%. Per data tweeted by Ali, there is an active community of artists and creators on Stacks and people have minted 650K Bitcoin NFTs on the layer 2 system.""Ordinals NFT on Bitcoin blockchain has been very successful, leading to a general Bitcoin NFT fever,"" CK Cheung, investment analyst at DeFiance Capital, said. ""Stacks is a beneficiary of this as it is an L2 supporting smart contracts built on top of the Bitcoin Network. People could mint new Bitcoin NFTs on top of Stacks with a lower cost and higher speed.""Last week, the bitcoin-focused Web 3 wallet Xverse rolled out support for Ordinals. At the same time, Hiro Wallet added support for inscriptions on its testnet, with Ali describing the same as Metamask for Bitcoin.Early this month, Gamma.io unveiled a no-code creator platform for NFTs on native Bitcoin through the use of ordinals, opening doors for users to create inscriptions without having to run a full Bitcoin node or write any code. Gamma's new launch essentially made Ordinals accessible to everyone.""Ordinals (inscriptions) are similar to NFTs, are digital assets inscribed on the smallest value of Bitcoin (satoshis). This is now opening up the use case for NFTs and merging them with the Bitcoin network security layer,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said in an email while pointing to the upcoming ""Building on Bitcoin Hackathon"" as the key event to watch out for in the short term.The hackathon, scheduled from Feb. 24 to March 7, will have participants build their own smart contracts using Clarity, programming language for writing smart contracts on the Stacks 2.0 blockchain.""This virtual hackathon is driving a lot of attention as Stacks uses 'Clarity,' a programming language for writing smart contracts that might be easier to learn than Solidity. The hackathon will reveal in the next two weeks if everybody can now build smart contracts without too much technical knowledge,"" Thielen noted.Finally, on top of all this, STX is seemingly drawing a haven bid, according to Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Reetika Malik.""STX is also one of the rare tokens approved by the SEC. So in these uncertain times when the regulator is going after a lot of crypto companies, an SEC-approved token also sounds like a good thing to the market,"" Malik said."
35,2023-02-20,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin tests $25,000, and here's what has to happen for it to break $30,00.Insights: The June arrival in Hong Kong of a framework for Virtual Asset Service Providers, such as exchanges, will not give retail investors access to crypto. But will that change?Here's How Bitcoin Hits $30,000Happy Monday. While the U.S. is off for Presidents’ Day, bitcoin was recently trading at $24,226, and ether $1,689, both in the red at close to 2% and 1.5% respectively in the past 24 hours, as Asia begins the work week.In the last week, bitcoin has gained over 11% while ether gained 9%. Layer 1 protocols including Solana, Polkadot, and Polygon have also made double-digit gains, up 20%, 19%, and 18.5%, respectively.DOGE is up 5% on week and SHIB is up 4%, having seen their gains from an Elon Musk tweet last week tested by the market. Floki, named after Musk’s dog, is down 7% on-day but still up 108% for the week.Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, says that $23,000 is bitcoin’s new support level and the next week is critical if bitcoin is to hit $30,000.“It was critical for bitcoin to reclaim $23,000 if we were to see more upside action,” he told CoinDesk in a note. “With February coming to an end, another bullish monthly close may be what the market needs for bitcoin to test $30,000.”DiPasquale thinks we’ll see the market consolidating if not going up, with a limited downside in the short term.Looking to the next week, Coinbase is scheduled to post earnings and investors are expecting lukewarm results. With regulators in the U.S. looking to cut off crypto’s banking access, Coinbase executives will probably have a lot to say on the topic.Let’s see if crypto’s upward rally can hold.No, Hong Kong Won’t Be Allowing Retail Traders Access to Crypto on June 1An earlier version of this story appeared Feb. 17 on CoinDesk.Hong Kong is warming up to crypto, and a licensing regime for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) – the local term for crypto exchanges – begins on June 1.Does this mean crypto will be ""fully legal"" in the city for everyone, as a tweet suggests? Not at all.While the situation may change later, for now the VASP framework for licensing exchanges, which just finished a multiyear consultation, allows them to provide access only to accredited professional investors. Retail investors are excluded.The Hong Kong government has indicated that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), its securities regulator, may consider retail access to virtual asset services in the future, after further consultation.In January, Reuters reported the SFC is in the process of considering which cryptocurrencies to offer to retail investors should the door eventually be opened to them. CEO Julia Leung is quoted as saying that only “highly liquid” assets will be on the list, and the choices will be very limited at first.The city's authorities see June 1 as an opportunity, saying ""Brand Hong Kong"" is much more highly regarded worldwide than, say, Seychelles or St. Kitts and Nevis. The regulator is expanding its headcount to deal with an anticipated flurry of license applications.“We’re able to bring together investments globally,” Christopher Hui, secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (FSTB), said in an earlier interview with CoinDesk. “We can manage and also channel these investments in a well-regulated and also sustainable manner.”Hong Kong’s credibility comes from its “rule of law, regulation, commercial modus operandi,” Hui said, and this translates well from traditional finance to crypto.Others in Hong Kong, however, see things differently.""For those platforms operated outside of Hong Kong, we see little incentive to incorporate in Hong Kong, establish an office here, go through the strict licensing requirements, as the local market is small,"" Leo Weese, co-founder of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, wrote in a 2021 post. ""Local institutional investors will be able to interact with foreign platforms through their foreign subsidiaries.""Still, he's optimistic the new regulations ""can reintroduce clarity and stability after years of uncertainty,"" Weese said in an interview. ""It is important that individuals are granted the easy access to bitcoin they have become accustomed to in the past 12 years.""Those individuals, the retail investors, are bound to be excited by the chance to use a local Hong Kong entity to trade. After all, there is no capital gains tax in Hong Kong, and Japan shows what happens when retail investors are able to trade  in a regulated environment. Post-FTX, Japanese traders seem to be living in a parallel world, where their tokens were stored with a custodian and funds are being returned.But it's not quite the retail investors' turn yet in Hong Kong.
